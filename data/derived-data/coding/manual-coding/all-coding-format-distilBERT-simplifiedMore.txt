91759653	19414	2018.1712	The CCS hub in Norway: some insights from 22 years of saline aquifer storage	The development of industrial-scale CCS in Norway, starting with the Sleipner project in 1996, gives a uniquely long track record of experience with CCS and provides valuable insights for the projected global growth in CCS. By the end of 2017, the Sleipner and Snohvit CCS projects had captured and stored 22 Mt of CO2 in saline aquifers offshore Norway. CO2 plume monitoring observations at Sleipner can be used to indicate an overall storage efficiency of around 5\% of the pore volume, with approximately one tenth of this volume dissolved in the brine phase. These estimates are consistent with the fluid dynamics of CO2 injection in which a gravity dominated processes are expected to give efficiencies in the range of 1-6\%. Future projects may be able to find ways of improving these efficiencies. Copyright (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

91759654	261211	2016.613	Varying Inundation Regimes Differentially Affect Natural and Sand-Amended Marsh Sediments	Climate change is altering sea level rise rates and precipitation patterns worldwide. Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to these changes. System responses to stressors are important for resource managers and environmental stewards to understand in order to best manage them. Thin layer sand or sediment application to drowning and eroding marshes is one approach to build elevation and resilience. The above- and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments were examined at varying inundation regimes between mean sea level and mean high water (0.82 m NAVD88 to 1.49 m NAVD88) in a field experiment at Laws Point, part of the Plum Island Sound Estuary (MA). Significantly lower salinities, pH, sulfides, phosphates, and ammonium were measured in the sand-amended sediments than in the natural sediments. In natural sediments there was a pattern of increasing salinity with increasing elevation while in the sand-amended sediments the trend was reversed, showing decreasing salinity with increasing elevation. Sulfide concentrations generally increased from low to high inundation with highest concentrations at the highest inundation (i.e., at the lowest elevations). High pore water phosphate concentrations were measured at low elevations in the natural sediments, but the sand-amended treatments had mostly low concentrations of phosphate and no consistent pattern with elevation. At the end of the experiment the lowest elevations generally had the highest measures of pore water ammonium. Soil carbon dioxide emissions were greatest in the sandamended mesocosms and at higher elevations. Differences in coarse root and rhizome abundances and volumes among the sediment treatments were detected with CT imaging, but by 20 weeks the natural and sand-amended treatments showed similar total belowground biomass at the intermediate and high elevations. Although differences in pore water nutrient concentrations, pH, salinity, and belowground root and rhizome morphology were detected between the natural and sand-amended sediments, similar belowground productivity and total biomass were measured by the end of the growing season. Since the belowground productivity supports organic matter accumulation and peat buildup in marshes, our results suggest that thin layer sand or sediment application is a viable climate adaptation action to build elevation and coastal resiliency, especially in areas with low natural sediment supplies.	ammonia;  organic matter;  pore water;  sulfide;  unclassified drug;  water, adaptation;  article;  below ground biomass;  biogeochemistry;  biomass;  carbon footprint;  climate adaptation;  comparative study;  computer assisted tomography;  concentration (parameters);  controlled study;  environmental parameters;  experimental design;  field experiment;  geographic and geological phenomena;  inundation regime;  marsh plant;  mesocosm;  morphology;  natural marsh sediment;  ph;  plant;  plant density;  plant parameters;  pore water constituent;  rhizome;  salinity;  sand amended marsh sediment;  sea level;  sediment;  shoot height;  soil analysis	2016	all_combined	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91759655	2896	2022.427	Guidelines for Analysing Coastal Flood Protection Systems after a Submersion	Storm Xynthia, which hit the French Atlantic coast on 28 February 2010, flooded vast territories despite coastal defences. This disaster highlighted the need to further study the behaviour of the coastal flood protection systems at an adapted geographical scale by considering the kinematics of the events. This objective has been achieved through a combination of conceptual input on the definition of protection systems, significant breakthroughs in the knowledge of the mechanisms governing the flooding, and via the improvement of strategies and methods dedicated to flood analysis and representation. The developed methodology was successfully tested on four sites submerged during Xynthia (Loix, Les Boucholeurs, and Boyardville, located in Charente-Maritime, and Batz-sur-Mer, located in Loire-Atlantique). This work is intended to guide the diagnosis of sites prone to marine flooding from the first investigations until the delivery of study reports. Beyond the usual focus on hydraulic structures, it provides guidelines to better analyse the interactions with the natural environment (sea, soil, dune, wetlands, etc.) and with the built environment (roads and urban networks, ponds used for fish farming, buildings, etc.). This systemic approach, which is applied to a territory considered as a complex adaptive system, is fundamental to understanding the reaction of a territory during a marine submersion event and subsequently developing adaptation or transformation strategies.	flood protection system; submersion; methodology; analysis; feedback	2022	all_combined	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

Here, we report a water wave motion sensor rooted in water wave friction, which is a combination of a liquid-solid triboelectric nanogenerator (LS-TENG) and a contact-separation TENG to form an integrated working mode. Combining these two mechanisms for sensing and collecting water wave energy, which specifically are the outermost interface friction with water waves and embedded classic TENG contained, this sensor can indicate the enhancement of water waves under gentle frequency in living environments. Under various water levels and frequencies from low to high, the voltage and current signals were systematically investigated and comparatively analyzed. They can reach about 60 V and 20 mu A, respectively, under a certain degree of a surging wave, which proves the indication ability of the device to specific water conditions, and waveform changes under extremely small water level changes were clearly observable. It is believed that, in the future, there will be dazzling performances in the areas of environmental monitoring and maritime security and navigation, which are very meaningful for people's livelihood.	self-powered sensing; water wave; contact electrification; energy harvesting; pvc	2022	all_combined	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91759665	7142	2020.873	``We can't do it on our own!{''} - Integrating stakeholder and scientific knowledge of future flood risk to inform climate change adaptation planning in a coastal region	Decision-makers face a particular challenge in planning for climate adaptation. The complexity of climate change's likely impacts, such as increased flooding, has widened the scope of information necessary to take action. This is particularly the case in valuable low-lying coastal regions, which host many competing interests, and where there is a growing need to draw from varied fields in the risk-based management of flooding. The rising scrutiny over science's ability to match expectations of policy actors has called for the integration of stakeholder and scientific knowledge domains. Focusing on the Broads - the United Kingdom's largest protected wetland - this study looked to assess future flood risk and consider potential adaptation responses in a collaborative approach. Interviews and surveys with local stakeholders accompanied the development of a hydraulic model in an iterative participatory design, centred on a scientist-stakeholder workshop. Knowledge and perspectives were shared on processes driving risk in the Broads, as well as on the implications of adaptation measures, allowing for their prioritisation. The research outcomes highlight not only the challenges that scientist-stakeholder integrated assessments of future flood risk face, but also their potential to lead to the production of useful information for decision-making.	flood risk management; climate change adaptation; integrated assessment; scientist-stakeholder engagement; flood modelling	2020	all_combined	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91759670	307894	2013.6768	Impact of coastal defence structures (tetrapods) on a demersal hard-bottom fish community in the southern North Sea	In the coming decades, artificial defence structures will increase in importance worldwide for the protection of coasts against the impacts of global warming. However, the ecological effects of such structures on the natural surroundings remain unclear. We investigated the impact of experimentally introduced tetrapod fields on the demersal fish community in a hard-bottom area in the southern North Sea. The results indicated a significant decrease in fish abundance in the surrounding area caused by migration effects towards the artificial structures. Diversity (HB) and evenness (E) values exhibited greater variation after the introduction of the tetrapods. Additionally, a distinct increase in young-of-the-year (YOY) fish was observed near the structures within the second year after introduction. We suggest that the availability of adequate refuges in combination with additional food resources provided by the artificial structures has a highly species-specific attraction effect. However, these findings also demonstrate that our knowledge regarding the impact of artificial structures on temperate fish communities is still too limited to truly understand the ecological processes that are initiated by the introduction of artificial structures. Long-term investigations and additional experimental in situ work worldwide will be indispensable for a full understanding of the mechanisms by which coastal defence structures interact with the coastal environment.

91759686	251185	2021.883	Shoreline Solutions: Guiding Efficient Data Selection for Coastal Risk Modeling and the Design of Adaptation Interventions	The Caribbean is affected by climate change due to an increase in the variability, frequency, and intensity of extreme weather events. When coupled with sea level rise (SLR), poor urban development design, and loss of habitats, severe flooding often impacts the coastal zone. In order to protect citizens and adapt to a changing climate, national and local governments need to investigate their coastal vulnerability and climate change risks. To assess flood and inundation risk, some of the critical data are topography, bathymetry, and socio-economic. We review the datasets available for these parameters in Jamaica (and specifically Old Harbour Bay) and assess their pros and cons in terms of resolution and costs. We then examine how their use can affect the evaluation of the number of people and the value of infrastructure flooded in a typical sea level rise/flooding assessment. We find that there can be more than a three-fold difference in the estimate of people and property flooded under 3m SLR. We present an inventory of available environmental and economic datasets for modeling storm surge/SLR impacts and ecosystem-based coastal protection benefits at varying scales. We emphasize the importance of the careful selection of the appropriately scaled data for use in models that will inform climate adaptation planning, especially when considering sea level rise, in the coastal zone. Without a proper understanding of data needs and limitations, project developers and decision-makers overvalue investments in adaptation science which do not necessarily translate into effective adaptation implementation. Applying these datasets to estimate sea level rise and storm surge in an adaptation project in Jamaica, we found that less costly and lower resolution data and models provide up to three times lower coastal risk estimates than more expensive data and models, indicating that investments in better resolution digital elevation mapping (DEM) data are needed for targeted local-level decisions. However, we also identify that, with this general rule of thumb in mind, cost-effective, national data can be used by planners in the absence of high-resolution data to support adaptation action planning, possibly saving critical climate adaptation budgets for project implementation.

91759692	8059	2021.1052	Marine and coastal ecosystem-based adaptation in Asia and Oceania: review of approaches and integration with marine spatial planning	There is growing interest in using ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) to maintain or restore ecosystem services to increase human resilience to climate change. However, to date, the focus on EbA has been on conceptualising the approach and encouraging its use, rather than understanding EbA in practice. We review the EbA literature to synthesise where, why and how marine and coastal EbA projects have been implemented and examine how EbA has been integrated with marine spatial planning. We focus specifically on EbA projects in Asia and Oceania, where climate variability and dependence on marine and coastal ecosystems is high. Most projects were found in the grey literature, implemented in developing countries, and targeted extreme events and sea level rise. Mangroves, particularly mangrove restoration, was the most common ecosystem used, followed by coral reefs. EbA across ecosystems commonly targeted capacity building and livelihood enhancement, and maintenance of wildlife, alongside shoreline protection for mangroves and food security for coral reefs. Integrated EbA and marine spatial planning projects were participatory, implemented at local-regional scales, displayed adaptive management, and community-based or shared governance. Our research helps to build an understanding of EbA in practice and a knowledge base to assist coastal communities in adapting to climate change.	asia; climate change; ecosystem services; ecosystem-based adaptation; marine and coastal; marine spatial planning; oceania	2021	all_combined	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1
91759693	290664	1997.598	Primary production, calcification, and air-sea CO2 fluxes of a macroalgal-dominated coral reef community (Moorea, French Polynesia)	Community metabolism and air-sea carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were investigated in July 1992 on a fringing reef at Moorea (French Polynesia). The benthic community was dominated by macroalgae (85% substratum cover) and comprised of Phaeophyceae Padina tenuis (Bory), Turbinaria ornata (Turner) J. Agardh, and Hydroclathrus clathratus Bory (Howe); Chlorophyta Halimeda incrassata f. ovata J. Agardh (Howe); and Ventricaria ventricosa J. Agardh (Olsen et West), as well as several Rhodophyta (Actinotrichia fragilis Forskal (Borgesen) and several species of encrusting coralline algae). Algal biomass was 171 g dry weightÂ·m-2. Community gross production (P(g)), respiration (R), and net calcification (G) were measured in an open top enclosure. P(g) and R were respectively 248 and 240 mmol CO2Â·m-2Â·d-1, and there was a slight net dissolution of CaCO3 (0.8 mmolÂ·m-2Â·d-1). This site was a sink for atmospheric CO2 (10 Â± 4 mmol CO2Â·m-2Â·d-1), and the analysis of data from the literature suggests that this is a general feature of algal-dominated reefs. Measurement of air-sea CO2 fluxes in open water close to the enclosure demonstrated that changes in small-scale hydrodynamics can lead to misleading conclusions. Net CO2 evasion to the atmosphere was measured on the fringing reef due to changes in the current pattern that drove water from the barrier reef (a CO2 source) to the study site.	air-sea flux;  algae;  calcification;  carbon dioxide;  coral reefs;  macroalage;  primary production;  reef, french polynesia;  moorea, actinotrichia;  actinotrichia fragilis;  actinotrichia fragilis;  algae;  anthozoa;  chlorophyta;  halimeda incrassata;  halimeda incrassata ovata;  hydroclathrus clathratus;  hydroclathrus clathratus;  padina tenuis;  padina tenuis;  phaeophyceae;  rhodophyta;  turbinaria ornata;  turbinaria ornata;  ventricaria ventricosa;  ventricaria ventricosa	1997	all_combined	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91759698	25253	2015.1539	Ecosystem engineering by large grazers enhances carbon stocks in a tidal salt marsh	Grazers can have a large impact on ecosystem processes and are known to change vegetation composition. However, knowledge of how the long-term presence of grazers affects soil carbon sequestration is limited. In this study, we estimated total accumulated organic carbon in soils of a back-barrier salt marsh and determined how this is affected by long-term grazing by both small and large grazers in relation to age of the ecosystem. In young marshes, where small grazers predominate, hare and geese have a limited effect on total accumulated organic carbon. In older, mature marshes, where large grazers predominate, cattle substantially enhanced carbon content in the marsh soil. We ascribe this to a shift in biomass distribution in the local vegetation towards the roots in combination with trampling effects on the soil chemistry. These large grazers thus act as ecosystem engineers: their known effect on soil compaction (based on a previous study) enhances anoxic conditions in the marsh soil, thereby reducing the oxygen available for organic carbon decomposition by the local microbial community. This study showed that the indirect effects of grazing can significantly enhance soil carbon storage through changing soil abiotic conditions. This process should be taken into account when estimating the role of ecosystems in reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Ultimately, we propose a testable conceptual framework that includes 3 pathways by which grazers can alter carbon storage: (1) through above-ground biomass removal, (2) through alteration of biomass distribution towards the roots and/or (3) by changing soil abiotic conditions that affect decomposition.	carbon sequestration; climate change; coastal wetland; grazing; redox potential; soil compaction; succession	2015	all_combined	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91759702	47284	2011.1833	Geochemical evaluation of CO2 injection into storage reservoirs based on case-studies in The Netherlands	Over the past few years several geochemical evaluations of CO2 storage in Dutch potential reservoirs are carried out, including predictions of the short-and long-term impact of CO2 on the reservoir using geochemical modelling. The initial mineralogy of the reservoir is frequently obtained from core analysis and is then used to compute the formation water composition. In this paper geochemical modelling with TOUGHREACT is used to predict and compare the short-and long-term geochemical impact of CO2 injection into three reservoirs. The mineralogical composition of these reservoirs is an assemblage based on commonly observed minerals from the Buntsandstein and Rotliegend formations. These formations contain potential onshore and offshore CO2 storage locations in the Netherlands. The results predict drying out and salt precipitation in the near-well area, due to water evaporation by the injected dry CO2. Several mineral transformations are predicted, dominated by the transformation of albite into dawsonite, thereby fixing CO2. Due to the relatively low density of dawsonite, the porosity significantly decreases, which can lead to a pore pressure increase. Disabling of dawsonite precipitation in the simulations, thereby taking into account the ongoing debate on dawsonite stability, only shows a small increase of the porosity. Future (experimental) work should be focused on dawsonite occurrence for accurate predictions of the long-term reservoir integrity.

The presented method aims at i) preliminary identifying the best sites for wind turbine generators installation and/or ii) estimating the average wind potential in small areas (e.g. archipelagos) for energy planning purposes. Firstly, a detailed literature review of existing techniques for wind speed estimation has been carried out, considering the most traditional methods (e.g. meteorological masts), remote sensing techniques and including a thorough review on the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) methods integrated with Geophysical Model Functions (GMFs) for wind speed retrieval. This review enables to identify CMOD5 (C Geophysical model function 5) as the best performing GMF overcoming the CMOD4 accuracy issues in high wind speed conditions. Thus, the method has been detailly described and showcased through the analysis of the case study. SAR images from the Sentinel 1 satellite have been processed by means of the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software. Afterwards, the wind speed and direction have been mapped through a Geographic Information System software. Lastly, the mean wind climate has been extrapolated for a specific Region Of Interest by the Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) 4.8 software. Consequentially, six hot spots characterized by high-energy potential have been identified as possible sites for possible installations of wind turbine generators.	wind energy potential assessment; sentinel 1 sar images; envi software; snap software; wind speed retrieval	2019	all_combined	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

Traditional engineering approaches optimizing for safety are often suboptimal with respect to other functions and are neither resilient nor sustainable. Densely populated deltas in particular need more resilient solutions that are robust, sustainable, adaptable, multifunctional and yet economically feasible. Innovative concepts such as `Building with Nature' provide a basis for coastal protection strategies that are able to follow gradual changes in climate and other environmental conditions, while maintaining flood safety, ecological values and socio-economic functions. This paper presents a conceptual framework for Building with Nature that is used to evaluate coastal protection strategies, based on a case study of the Holland coast in the Netherlands. The added value and the limitations of these strategies are discussed.	storm surge protection; coastal maintenance; building with nature; ecosystem services; adaptive management; sea-level rise	2013	all_combined	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91759710	13531	2021.1847	The coral conservation crisis: interacting local and global stressors reduce reef resiliency and create challenges for conservation solutions	Coral reefs are one of the most productive and biodiverse ecosystems in the world. Humans rely on these coral reef ecosystems to provide significant ecological and economic resources; however, coral reefs are threatened by numerous local and global anthropogenic factors that cause significant environmental change. The interactions of these local and global human impacts may increase the rate of coral reef degradation. For example, there are many local influences (i.e., sedimentation and submarine groundwater discharge) that may exacerbate coral bleaching and mortality. Therefore, researchers and resource managers cannot limit their narratives and actions to mitigating a sole stressor. With the continued increase in greenhouse gas emissions, management strategies and restoration techniques need to account for the scale at which environmental change occurs. This review aims to outline the various local and global anthropogenic stressors threatening reef resiliency and address the recent disagreements surrounding present-day conservation practices. Unfortunately, there is no one solution to preserve and restore all coral reefs. Each coral reef region is challenged by numerous interactive stressors that affect its ecosystem response, recovery, and services in various ways. This review discusses, while global reef degradation occurs, local solutions should be implemented to efficiently protect the coral reef ecosystem services that are valuable to marine and terrestrial environments.	coral reefs; environmental change; ocean warming; ocean acidification; human impacts	2021	all_combined	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

In making choices about how to respond to rising sea level, planners are challenged with weighing easily quantified risks (e.g., loss of property value due to inundation) against those that are more difficult to quantify (e.g., loss of primary production or carbon sequestration services provided by wetlands due to inundation). Our goal was to develop a cost-effective, appropriately-scaled, model-based approach that allows planners to predict, under various sea level rise and response scenarios, the economic cost of wetland lossâ€”with the estimates proxied by the costs of future restoration required to maintain the existing level of wetland habitat services. Our approach applies the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model to predict changes in wetland habitats over the next century, and then applies Habitat Equivalency Analysis to predict the cost of restoration projects required to maintain ecological services at their present, pre-sea level rise level. We demonstrate the application of this approach in the Delaware Bay estuary and in the Indian River Lagoon (Florida), and discuss how this approach can support future coastal decision-making.

91759715	284568	2022.5546	A Technical Assessment of Offshore Wind Energy in Mexico: A Case Study in Tehuantepec Gulf	The growing energy demand has increased the consumption of hydrocarbons in developing countries such as Mexico, which has contributed to accelerating global warming. Although Mexico has suitable offshore wind energy harvesting sites, technical assessments to identify technologies to be placed in specific locations are scarce. In Mexico, offshore wind resources are found in depths larger than 50 m. There, floating platforms are convenient for harnessing wind energy. This work presents a technical evaluation of offshore wind energy in one of the regions with a higher availability of wind resources on the Mexican coasts, the Tehuantepec Gulf, in the Pacific Ocean. First, a specific location is chosen to evaluate its maritime conditions and theoretical wind energy potential. Next, the performance of a floating offshore wind turbine platform has been investigated numerically using potential flow simulations. The motions of the platform were analyzed for different drafts when subjected to different environmental conditions in the evaluated region. These conditions include wave and wind scenarios with the highest probability of occurrence and the most extreme ones. From the evaluation of the platform dynamics in these scenarios, it was possible to identify the general working conditions of the platform. Results showed that the proposed FOWT could be suitable to be deployed in the region of interest for the most probable environmental conditions, presenting a possible energy production within 3â€“4 MW, approximately. However, motion stabilization should be required when subjected to extreme environmental conditions as the structure could significantly increase its surge and pitch motions. The simplified approach employed in this work can help perform the following steps in technical or practical resource assessments of wind energy in other places in Mexico or similar developing regions.

91759717	5281	2022.758	Collaboration a solution for small island developing states to address food security and economic development in the face of climate change	Collaboration and cooperation between and across countries, communities, and individuals is critical for the capacity of social-ecological systems (SES) to respond to climate change. In Solomon Islands, the tuna fisheries' SES provides food security, income, employment, and contributes significantly to the nation's economy. However, being at the frontline of climate change impacts, the fisheries' SES is under threat, and these impacts will compound existing challenges. We explore Solomon Islands' tuna fisheries' SES resilience and vulnerability with a focus on examining efforts towards coordination, cooperation, and collaboration within the fisheries and governance framework. The research reveals a `Pacific-way' of building resilience through multiple scales of collaborative and cooperative governance. Regional level collaborative forums such as the Parties to the Nauru Agreement, national fisheries programmes setting up coordination and cooperative networks, and local cooperative and coordination efforts that carry out multiple functions also build tuna fisheries' SES resilience to climate change. Western technical and top-down approaches translate into social resilience when coupled with education and outreach and leveraged upon existing grass-roots collaborative and cooperative networks. These cross-scale linkages of collaboration and adaptation strategies form resilience across multiple scales of governance. However, it is important to have a deliberate multi-scalar climate change adaptation framework.	climate change; social-ecological systems; solomon islands; vulnerability; resilience	2022	all_combined	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91759720	227830	2018.15050	Development and application of a simulator for offshore wind turbine blades installation	In an offshore environment, offshore wind energy resources are more available and stable, but the investment cost is much higher than that of onshore wind. The installation cost is a crucial factor of the investment. With the increasing number of planned and approved offshore wind farms, offshore wind turbine installation and relevant operations have received tremendous attention. Therefore, expediting the turbine-structure mating operations through a higher level of automation in offshore wind turbine installations may provide important economic benefits. To achieve a higher automation level and reduce the weather waiting time during the installation of offshore wind turbines, a flexible simulation-verification framework with high fidelity is needed. However, state-of-the-art wind turbine numerical analysis code is neither convenient nor open enough for applications concerning the design and verification of control algorithms. MATLAB/Simulink is among the most widely utilized numerical platforms by control engineers and researchers. This paper describes the development of a modularized blade installation simulation toolbox for the purpose of control design in MATLAB/Simulink. The toolbox can be used to simulate several blade installation configurations, both onshore and offshore. The paper presents the key features and equations of the different modules, exemplified by a single blade installation operation. Code-to-code verification results are presented and discussed with both quasi-steady wind and three-dimensional turbulent wind field.	offshore installation; blade installation; simulation model; matlab (r) and simulink (r)	2018	all_combined	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91759722	262170	2016.3166	THE ROLE OF WETLANDS FOR MITIGATING ECONOMIC DAMAGE FROM HURRICANES	Coastal communities along the United States coast often experience significant economic damage resulting from the impacts of tropical storms and hurricanes. Research suggests that certain factors that affect economic damages are increasing the vulnerability of coastal communities. Population growth, which increases vulnerability by placing valuable lives and assets in the path of storms, is expected to increase. Climate change has the potential to cause more frequent and intense storms, and coastal wetland loss is contributing to the vulnerability of coastal populations. Wetlands conservation and restoration is often advocated for as a means of reducing the impacts of coastal storms. The relationship between wetlands and storm surge energy is understood relatively well in physical terms, but very little economic analysis has been conducted to estimate the degree to which wetlands reduce economic impacts. Using factor analysis, the relationships among coastal populations, wetlands, storm intensity, and economic damage are explored. The factor analysis suggests that wetland presence is associated with a reduction in economic damages from coastal storms. Factor score analysis suggests that the proportion of damage explained by wetland presence is smaller for more intense storms. These results are consistent with those found in the physical science literature and have potentially large consequences for how wetlands are used in risk reduction.

91763132	387540	2021.19186	Performance Evaluation Concept for Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion toward Standardization and Intelligent Design	Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) uses a very simple process to convert the thermal energy stored mainly in tropical oceans into electricity. In designs, operations, and evaluations, we need to consider the unique characteristics of OTEC to achieve the best performance or lower the electricity cost of projects. The concept and design constraints of OTEC power generation differ from those of conventional thermal power plants due to the utilization of a low temperature difference. This research theoretically recognizes the unique characteristics of the energy conversion system and summarizes the appropriate performance evaluation methods for OTEC based on finite-time thermodynamics and the equilibrium condition of the heat source. In addition, it presents the concept of normalization of thermal efficiency for OTEC and exergy efficiency based on the available thermal energy in the ocean defined as the transferable thermal energy from the ocean and the equilibrium condition as the dead state for exergy. The differences between conventional thermal efficiency and the effectiveness of the evaluation methods are visualized using the various reference design data, and it is ascertained that there is no clear relation between the conventional thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency, whereas the normalized thermal efficiency is definitely proportional to the exergy efficiency. Moreover, the exergy efficiency shows the effectiveness of the staging Rankine, Kalina, and Uehara cycles. Therefore, the normalized thermal efficiency and the exergy efficiency are important to analyze the heat and mass balance as well as improvement of the system. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Hurricane Dorian exemplified all three attributes. Dorian's destructive passage over the Abaco Islands, Bahamas, on September 1, 2019, exposed residents of its capital, Marsh Harbour, to a prolonged encounter with the storm's core. After Dorian's fierce front eyewall and towering storm surge tore apart shanty town habitats and eviscerated concrete homesites, residents desperately sought refuge during the brief respite when Dorian's eye passed directly overhead. The category 5 winds then resumed abruptly and Dorian continued its relentless destruction. This article focuses on the storm's mental health consequences, drawing on observations of on-site clinicians as well as findings from previous research on the mental health effects of Atlantic hurricanes and the transformation of hurricane hazards resulting from climate change. To protect island and coastal populations against climate-driven storms, disaster planning policy should emphasize resilience-focused prevention and mitigation strategies. In the aftermath of these events, health system response should include community outreach, case finding, and evidence-based interventions that optimize the use of mental health professionals.

91763138	385288	2021.16669	Influence of Low-Permeability Layers on the Installation and the Response to Vertical Cyclic Loading of Suction Caissons	Offshore wind is a key part of the change toward renewable energy sources. Offshore wind farm developments are moving to sites that are characterized by increased water depths and layered soil profiles, e.g., in the North Sea. Suction caisson-based jacked structures are expected to be increasingly used to support wind turbines at such sites. Experience of suction caissons serving as foundations for offshore wind turbines is limited. The mechanisms governing the suction caisson installation in layered soils are poorly understood and no published data of the in-service performance of suction caisson jackets supporting offshore wind turbines in layered soils exists. This gap is addressed here through a series of centrifuge tests investigating the installation and the response of suction caissons in layered soils - sand over clay and clay over sand - subjected to vertical cyclic loading into tension. The results reveal the mechanisms enabling suction caisson installation in layered soils and the complex load transfer mechanisms governing the suction caisson response under vertical cyclic loading. The clay layer plays a key role: in sand over clay, it encapsulates the sand plug, which leads to predominantly undrained behavior. In clay over sand, the uplift of the clay soil plug is critical both in facilitating suction installation and in response to vertical cyclic loading in tension. These findings provide confidence for suction installation and caisson response under vertical cyclic loading into tension in layered soils.

91763142	134772	2020.13839	Comparing feedback and spatial approaches to advance ecosystem-based fisheries management in a changing Antarctic	To implement ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management, decision makers need insight on the potential costs and benefits of the policy options available to them. In the Southern Ocean, two such options for addressing trade-offs between krill-dependent predators and the krill fishery include ``feedback management{''} (FBM) strategies and marine protected areas (MPAs); in theory, the first adjusts to change, while the latter is robust to change. We compared two possible FBM options to a proposed MPA in the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea given a changing climate. One of our feedback options, based on the density of Antarctic krill (Euphasia superba), projected modest increases in the abundances of some populations of krill predators, whereas outcomes from our second FBM option, based on changes in the abundances of penguins, were more mixed, with some areas projecting predator population declines. The MPA resulted in greater increases in some, but not all, predator populations than either feedback strategy. We conclude that these differing outcomes relate to the ways the options separate fishing and predator foraging, either by continually shifting the spatial distribution of fishing away from potentially vulnerable populations (FBM) or by permanently closing areas to fishing (the MPA). For the krill fishery, we show that total catches could be maintained using an FBM approach or slightly increased with the MPA, but the fishery would be forced to adjust fishing locations and sometimes fish in areas of relatively low krill density-both potentially significant costs. Our work demonstrates the potential to shift, rather than avoid, ecological risks and the likely costs of fishing, indicating trade-offs for decision makers to consider.

91763146	36932	2017.2549	Feral hog disturbance alters carbon dynamics in southeastern US salt marshes	Disturbances that remove primary producers and alter substrate chemistry commonly influence ecosystem carbon dynamics. Because coastal wetlands are especially effective in sequestering carbon, quantifying how disturbances may alter their ability to perform this climate-regulating function is important for assessing their carbon storage potential. Here, we quantified soil respiration, litter decomposition, and soil organic carbon (SOC), as a proxy for carbon storage, in areas disturbed by invasive feral hogs Sus scrofa and in adjacent, undisturbed areas within 3 southeastern US salt marshes. Contrary to our hypothesis that hog overturning of soils would stimulate soil respiration, this metric was lower and both surface and subsurface litter decomposition rates were similar in disturbed relative to undisturbed areas across all sites. SOC was lower in disturbed versus undisturbed areas at 2 sites as hypothesized, but higher at 1 site. Surveys and ana lyses reveal that lower and less variable infauna, plant, and benthic algae densities likely suppressed soil respiration in hog-disturbed versus undisturbed areas, while the offsetting effects of lower invertebrate densities and higher soil temperature likely caused decomposition to be consistent within and outside of disturbed areas. Conversely, between-site variation in disturbance intensity, plant canopy structure, and burrowing crab densities mediated the SOC response. These findings suggest that hog removal of plants and disruption of soils can cause tracts of marsh to transition from carbon sinks to sources where these disturbances are intense enough to prohibit rapid plant recovery and promote the gradual respiration of carbon stocks from denuded soils.	carbon cycling; coastal wetland; soil respiration; litter decomposition; spartina alterniflora; benthic algae	2017	Laurent	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91763147	279376	2009.1836	Integrating a full carbon capture scheme onto a 450 MWe NGCC electric power generation hub for offshore operations: Presenting the Sevan GTW concept	Sevan Marine and Siemens have developed a floating power plant - entitled Sevan GTW (gas-to-wire) - based on Sevan's cylindrical platform and Siemens' SCC-800 combined cycle, and SINTEF has adapted a post-combustion CO2 capture process for on board integration including compression and preconditioning of the CO2. Main emphasis has been placed on developing an optimised conceptual design within the structural constraints, and assessing how efficient the capture unit may be operated in consideration of the dynamic behaviour induced by the sea on the absorber and desorber columns via the floating carrier. The rational behind this technology selection is the urgency in making appropriate steps for a quick start for remote power generation at sea with the inclusion of CCS to serve offshore oil and gas operations. This calls for modular power blocks made up by high efficient combined power cycles with post-combustion exhaust gas cleaning. From this point of view a system with four absorption columns and one desorber unit has been determined based on structured packing material. The capture process has been integrated with the power cycle in due consideration of the sea forces. It is shown that a permanent tilt becomes more important than periodic movements provided the harmonic periods are kept within a certain level (&lt;20 s). Operational conditions and constraints vis-Ã -vis movements and trimming of the floater have been addressed and discussed with reference to available literature. This also includes the liquid hold-up and gas-liquid interfacial area in the absorption columns linked with tilting. Optimisation reveals that a reboiler duty of 3.77 GJ/ton CO2 would result in the lowest capture cost. With a energy penalty of 9%-points the Sevan GTW concept presents itself as a realistic concept deemed to be within reach today. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

91763149	8056	2022.1125	A Flood Risk Management Model to Identify Optimal Defence Policies in Coastal Areas Considering Uncertainties in Climate Projections	Coastal areas are particularly vulnerable to flooding from heavy rainfall, sea storm surge, or a combination of the two. Recent studies project higher intensity and frequency of heavy rains, and progressive sea level rise continuing over the next decades. Pre-emptive and optimal flood defense policies that adaptively address climate change are needed. However, future climate projections have significant uncertainty due to multiple factors: (a) future CO2 emission scenarios; (b) uncertainties in climate modelling; (c) discount factor changes due to market fluctuations; (d) uncertain migration and population growth dynamics. Here, a methodology is proposed to identify the optimal design and timing of flood defense structures in which uncertainties in 21st century climate projections are explicitly considered probabilistically. A multi-objective optimization model is developed to minimize both the cost of the flood defence infrastructure system and the flooding hydraulic risk expressed by Expected Annual Damage (EAD). The decision variables of the multi-objective optimization problem are the size of defence system and the timing of implementation. The model accounts for the joint probability density functions of extreme rainfall, storm surge and sea level rise, as well as the damages, which are determined dynamically by the defence system state considering the probability and consequences of system failure, using a water depth-damage curve related to the land use (Corine Land Cover); water depth due to flooding are calculated by hydraulic model. A new dominant sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) is used to solve the multi-objective problem optimization. A case study is presented for the Pontina Plain (Lazio Italy), a coastal region, originally a swamp reclaimed about a hundred years ago, that is rich in urban centers and farms. A set of optimal adaptation policies, quantifying size and timing of flood defence constructions for different climate scenarios and belonging to the Pareto curve obtained by the NSGAII are identified for such a case study to mitigate the risk of flooding and to aid decision makers.	climate change; multi-objective optimization; coastal region; pumping plant; flooding	2022	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763161	10257	2021.1387	Coastal Migration due to 21st Century Sea-Level Rise	Rising mean and extreme sea-levels and induced increased coastal flooding are expected to lead to massive coastal migration if coasts are not protected. Using a wide range of sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios, socioeconomic pathways and discount rate assumptions, 21st century coastal migration is assessed at global scale assuming local cost-benefit optimal protection decisions for about 12,000 coastal segments with homogeneous coastal and socioeconomic characteristics. Costs considered include investment and maintenance cost for protection, migration cost in the case of no protection, and expected annual damage to assets by extreme sea-level events that over-top existing protection. Robust decisions in favor of protection over all scenarios are found for about 3\% of the global coastline, covering 78\% of global coastal population and 92\% of global coastal floodplain assets. For the remaining 97\% of global coastline cumulative 21st century land loss ranges from 60,000 to 415,000 km(2) and coastal migration ranges from 17 to 72 million people. Big countries with long uninhabited coastlines suffer the biggest land losses. In absolute terms big countries in South and South-east Asia account for the highest coastal migration, while in relative terms small island nations suffer most. Global cost of 21st century SLR can be lowered by factor two to four if local cost-benefit decisions also consider, next to protection, coastal migration as an adaptation option.	coastal migration; coastal sea level rise impacts; multiple scenario analysis; sea level rise adaptation	2021	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763163	205546	2016.11390	Supply chain integration opportunities for the offshore wind industry A literature review	Purpose - This paper surveys the literature on supply chain integration (SCI) to identify the state of research in the various types of studied industries and manufacturing environments. The purpose of this paper is to identify academic discoveries that could provide offshore wind projects with means to overcome their current supply chain challenges. Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive literature review was conducted involving 162 articles published in 29 peer-reviewed journals. The papers were analyzed in terms of the dimensions of SCI, research methodology, unit of analysis, level of analysis, type of industry and manufacturing environment being studied, integrative practices, integrative barriers and the link between SCI and performance. Findings - While SCI has been evolving to become an influential topic in the field of supply chain management, scholars have overlooked industrial contingencies by ignoring the differences between the studied industrial contexts, especially project-based manufacturing environments. The present review also reveals that no study of SCI has been conducted on the construction of renewable energy projects. Another finding is that case studies and research articles using networks as a unit of analysis are underrepresented. Originality/value - This is the first work to advocate for an industrial contingency approach in the analysis of SCI. Thus, it proposes the offshore wind farm-construction industry as a potential study subject to broaden the knowledge in SCI in project manufacturing environments.	energy sector; supply chain management; literature review; construction; renewable energies; offshore; wind-biomass	2016	Laurent	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91763164	523	2016.44	Coastal tourism space in the context of climate change: discourses and strategies	Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to explore how climate change and the discourses about adaptation to climate change are altering the spatial development of the tourism industry in coastal destinations. The paper also identifies how tourist development and climate change adaptation can be combined to transform space and place, especially in coastal tourism areas. Design/methodology/approach - Using a theoretical approach based on the concept of production of space, the study focuses on relational space, relationships expressed through representations of space and social practices. A case study method is used to analyze the socio-geographic processes at work in the adaptation to climate change in a coastal tourism community in Quebec, Canada. The analysis of the study utilized Nvivo with thematic textual queries. Findings - The results reveal an adaptation process at work, based on a ``hold the line{''} strategy, where private stakeholders choose to invest in defensive structures to mitigate the impact of rising sea levels and erosion. This strategy reflects coordinated action in the face of the risk and to protect high-value land property. Research limitations/implications - This research illustrates how tourism and climate change adaptation discourses intersect. It also reveals how tourism development promotes the values and image of coastal space and how this can conflict with an efficient climate change adaptation strategy. Originality/value - This research provides guidelines for coastal tourism communities, enabling them to design their own climate change adaptation strategy, taking into account how the different social discourses and tourism practices interact with climate change adaptation. It also provides some insights into the criteria that influence an effective climate change adaptation strategy.	climate change; coastal community; coastal tourism space; production of space	2016	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763165	234476	2016.6211	Fish conservation in freshwater and marine realms: status, threats and management	1. Despite the disparities in size and volume of marine and freshwater realms, a strikingly similar number of species is found in each - with 15 150 Actinopterygian fishes in fresh water and 14 740 in the marine realm. Their ecological and societal values are widely recognized yet many marine and freshwater fishes increasingly risk local, regional or global extinction. 2. The prevailing threats in aquatic systems are habitat loss and degradation, invasive species, pollution, over-exploitation and climate change. Unpredictable synergies with climate change greatly complicate the impacts of other stressors that threaten many marine and freshwater fishes. 3. Isolated and fragmented habitats typically present the most challenging environments for small, specialized freshwater and marine fishes, whereas overfishing is by far the greatest threat to larger marine and freshwater species. Species that migrate within or between freshwater and marine realms may face high catchability in predictable migration bottlenecks, and degradation of breeding habitat, feeding habitat or the intervening migration corridors. 4. Conservation reserves are vital to protect species-rich habitats, important radiations, and threatened endemic species. Integration of processes that connect terrestrial, freshwater and marine protected areas promises more effective conservation outcomes than disconnected reserves. Diadromous species in particular require more attention in aquatic restoration and conservation planning across disparate government agencies. 5. Human activities and stressors that increasingly threaten freshwater and marine fishes must be curbed to avoid a wave of extinctions. Freshwater recovery programmes range from plans for individual species to recovery of entire basin faunas. Reducing risks to threatened marine species in coastal habitats also requires conservation actions at multiple scales. Most of the world's larger economically important fisheries are relatively well-monitored and well-managed but there are urgent needs to curb fishing mortality and minimize catch of the most endangered species in both realms.

91763170	243208	2021.6948	Developing sustainable small-scale fisheries livelihoods in Indonesia: Trends, enabling and constraining factors, and future opportunities	Small-scale fisheries (SSF) provide crucial contributions to livelihoods, food and nutrition security, and the wellbeing of coastal communities worldwide. In Indonesia, 2.5 million households are involved in SSF production, yet these households are characterised by high poverty rates and vulnerability due to declining ecosystem health and climatic change. In this study we applied the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to analyse the characteristics and immediate and longer-term outcomes of 20 SSF livelihood-focused intervention programs implemented in coastal communities across the Indonesian Archipelago over the last two decades. Projects covered a wide range of spatial scales, funding providers and key participants. Factors supporting positive program outcomes included application of inclusive and holistic approaches to sustainable livelihoods, implemented and supported over appropriate time frames; use of participatory capacity development methodologies and locallysituated project facilitators; and collaborative engagement with local government, non-government organisations and private-sector actors. However, it was impossible to identify evidenced successes from a longer-term sustainability perspective. Short project timeframes, absence of baseline or monitoring data, pressure for satisfactory reports to donors, and limited post-project evaluation, together with invisibility of women's work and noncommercial exchanges, affected the adequacy of assessments. Given the lack of post-project assessment among projects studied, a thorough review of longer-term project impacts is recommended, guided by the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework, to evaluate sustained improvements in livelihoods outcomes and environmental sustainability. This would support best-practice design and implementation of SSF livelihood-focused interventions, disseminated beyond academia, to influence policy and development to achieve socio-economic equity and environmental goals.	small-scale fisheries (ssf); livelihood-focused interventions; coastal livelihoods; sustainable livelihood framework; evaluation; indonesia	2021	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1
91763180	13452	2022.1864	Towards adaptive coastal management law: Lessons from Australia and Brazil	Although adaptive management has been advocated for dealing with the complexity and dynamics of social ecological systems for more than 40 years, successful outcomes in practice have been limited. Among the efforts to overcome this implementation gap, there has been a growing interest in understanding the role of law in adaptive management. In this article, we provide an analysis of adaptive management in two jurisdictions struggling with coastal erosion in the context of their legal arrangements for coastal management: (i) Byron Shire, a local government area in the State of New South Wales, Australia; and (ii) Florian acute accent opolis, a municipality in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Methods included document analysis and inductive thematic coding of 50 semi-structured interviews with key informants from four different stakeholder groups. Our results indicate that both legal certainty and legal flexibility are relevant for adaptive management success. Three directions towards coupling adaptive coastal management with law are suggested: (i) to incorporate adaptive management into coastal management legislation; (ii) to address legal path dependencies that cause maladaptation; and (iii) to integrate adaptive coastal management and adaptive coastal governance through adaptive coastal management law. Our suggestions contribute to improved knowledge on adaptive coastal management law by emphasising the need for an optimal balance between legal flexibility and legal certainty, which represents an avenue for further research and policy development beyond the jurisdictions analysed.	adaptive management; adaptive governance; climate change adaptation; coastal management; law; managed retreat	2022	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763181	237912	2012.3644	Environmental impact of detached breakwaters on the Mediterranean coastline of Soliman (North-East of Tunisia)	The coastline of Soliman (North-East of Tunisia) suffered from erosion mainly during a strong storm that occurred in 1981. Two breakwaters were constructed in 1989 to protect the shoreline in front of the Solymar hotel and five detached breakwaters were implanted between 1989 and 1990 for the protection of the zone of the Soliman Beach from shoreline retreat. The evolution of the coastal area and the effect of these breakwaters were studied using aerial photographs treated by digital photogrammetric methods. The distances of coastline retreat or advance and the areas lost or gained along the studied zone were calculated by GIS software. The breakwaters of the Solymar hotel formed two tombolos. The breakwaters of the Soliman Beach which are very near the shoreline developed very small tombolos and those which are very far form the shoreline gave rise to eroded areas. The studied zone is subjected to important erosion evaluated at-167,354 m(2) despite the installation of the breakwaters. Such result is explained by the effect of the protective structures' characteristics mainly the breakwaters lengths, the shoreline-breakwater distance, and the gap between successive breakwaters. In addition, the gyratory currents generated by the North North-Western waves play a great role in depriving the beach of Soliman of sediments.	breakwaters; coastline; erosion; soliman; tunisia	2012	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91763188	45955	2002.922	Capacity building for a sustainable shipping industry: a key ingredient in improving coastal and ocean and management	Shipping and ports are major factors in coastal and ocean development and have significant direct and indirect impacts on coasts and oceans. Transportation systems and particularly international shipping have always influenced coastal settlement and economic development activities. The emergence of issues, such as biodiversity protection, biosecurity and climate change, mandate a more integrated approach to dealing with ocean-based activities, such as shipping. However, the maritime industry-shipping and ports-is internally fragmented and both are isolated from the contemporary integrated coastal and ocean discussion and practice, despite their impact on coastal and ocean activity. This article argues that the maritime sector is a key factor in effective integrated marine ecosystem development and protection and should take a leadership role. However, there needs to be increased capacity to do so. Education and training relevant to sustainable development and integrated management practice needs to be widely and methodically available, particularly in the initial stages of Maritime Education and Training (MET) where professional values and practices are developed. Marine and maritime education should be integrated with a view to preparing people to work in an environment in which there is a wider range of actors and activities involved in matters relating to the impact of the shipping industry on coastal development and preservation. There needs to be education to encourage reflective thinking and human relations skills development for both on shore and seagoing personnel. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thereafter, 85 percent of Greater New Orleans was flooded, 1,500 lives were lost, and approximately 100, 000 were left homeless. New Orleans' hurricane protection system failed catastrophically, leavi ng miles of levees without protection from waves. With global warming accelerating, smarter planning is needed for many coastal cities and communities. Surge defenses that make full use of natural and man-made components need to be augmented with sustainable development and retreat from low-lying coastal regions. Coastal restoration is the key to the future habitation of soutbeast Louisiana, together with an east-west levee/surge protection system across the mid-coast. This latter system must be complimented and protected by aggressive coastal wetland and barrier island restoration.

Appropriate locations for geotextile bag revetments: An analysis. Social pressure exerted by urban development, the increase in erosion on many coastal stretches, and the rise in sea level due to climate change over the last few decades have led governments to increase investment in coastal protection. In turn, a reduction in costs and increases in ease of construction and rate of implementation have led to sand-filled geotextile elements, such as bags, tubes, and containers, becoming an alternative or supplement to traditional coastal defence materials, such as rubble mounds, concrete, and so on. Not all coastal zones are appropriate for sand-filled geotextile structures as coastal defences. This article analyses suitable zones for locating geotextile bag revetments to protect coasts from storm erosion and concludes that the least suitable zones are the surf zone (on an open coast and on a slightly protected coast) and deep water (on an open coast), except if a suitable reinforcement is carried out when the demand makes it necessary this build this kind of defence.

91763207	7089	2016.553	Assessing coastal flood risk in a changing climate for the City of Vancouver	Despite global mitigation efforts, climate change will impact the City of Vancouver's future. One anticipated impact, sea level rise, is described. A comprehensive understanding of the consequences of these impacts is necessary to guide the process of identifying preferred adaptation strategies. A methodology for a coastal flood risk assessment (CFRA) of sea level rise is provided. The inputs for this risk assessment include inundation mapping and an asset-at-risk inventory. These data sets are combined with flood damage information from Hazus to look at consequences of coastal flooding. There are many uncertainties and gaps in the process of developing a CFRA for a modern, dense, urban city such as Vancouver, particularly when the planning timelines required for preparing and adapting to sea level rise are long. The value of the process and results include increased understanding of hazards and vulnerabilities, and the development of useful visual tools for engagement, planning and education.

Blue Carbon (BC) ecosystems (mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows) provide climate regulation services by sequestering and storing carbon, presenting an opportunity for SIDS to address climate change and implement Paris Agreement commitments in their Covid-19 recovery. BC habitat decline not only reduces carbon sequestration benefits provided, but can also result in sediment disturbance and the release of previously stored carbon back into the atmosphere. In this work, a scenario analysis informed by a stakeholder workshop and scientific and socio-economic expectations is used to assess the economic importance of Grenada's BC (mangroves and seagrasses) over the next 10, 25 and 50 years. Our findings indicate that sequestration benefits are severely diminished under Business-as-Usual habitat loss, but still marginally outweigh losses from carbon emissions, with overall welfare gains of US$0.5â€“1.9 million over 50 years. To stimulate economic recovery post-pandemic, stakeholders anticipated a realistic scenario of increased habitat decline resulting in overall losses of US$5.4â€“19.4 million in the next 50 years. However, if ecosystems are maintained, overall carbon benefits could reach US$10.7 million, while a 20% increase in mangroves over the next 25 years provides benefits reaching US$11.1 million between 2020 and 2070. These results demonstrate a significant increase in value when BC ecosystems are maintained and not disturbed, preventing the release of previously stored carbon and enhancing sequestration capacity. Restoration benefits are marginal, compared to conservation, supporting claims that conservation is more cost effective.

91763214	249438	2018.11461	A plan nobody hopes they will need New Zealand and climate change migration	At the Second Pacific Climate Change conference in Wellington in February 2018, New Zealand's Minister for Pacific Peoples, `Aupito Tofae Su'a William Sio, said New Zealand must have policies in place to deal with the possibility of climate-induced migration from the Pacific Islands. He described having such a policy in place as being akin to a factory preparing an evacuation plan in case of an earthquake: A vital precaution for something everybody hoped would never be needed. But what would that policy look like, how far forward would planners have to think, what issues are involved and who would be responsible for making sure it was effective? This article examines four key areas of concern that will have to be dealt with if an effective policy on climate change-induced migration is to be developed: Public perceptions, the law, maintaining Island culture and identity and changing the existing media narrative on social change. It identifies three groups of key players in the process: Legislators and legal experts, churches, and journalists.	churches; climate change; journalism; law; media; migration; new zealand; policy; social justice; south pacific	2018	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763217	998	2021.131	Adaptation to climate change in coastal towns of between 10,000 and 50,000 inhabitants	This chapter focuses on mainland coastal towns that have populations of between 10,000 and 50,000 inhabitants. Through six case studies, the chapter develops an understanding of the characteristics that shape each of the communities. By exploring the climate change hazards each of the case studies are experiencing now and forecast into the future, the physical and ecological profile and the human development condition, a view of the climate impacts for each is shaped. The six case study areas include towns that are large enough to be a regional centre, down to much less organised and resourced communities that are at a more subsistence level of development. The case studies include communities that range from tropical storm areas to more temperate climatic areas. Adaptation strategies for each case study are observed, drawing out the similarities and the differences. Insights and lessons learnt show that the bottom-up inclusion of all communities in shaping the adaptation approach is crucial, together with alignment of policy between governments from national to local. Also crucial is the resourcing of local councils which sit on the front line of many adaptation initiatives. The role of universities and other research organisations to provide data, skills training and a toolbox of methodologies to those in the front line leadership roles. An important insight is the collaborative opportunity for universities, communities and agencies to draw out the innovative adaptation strategies that can inform other coastal communities from the smallest village to the largest city.	coastal hazards; coastal towns; climate change; engaging communities; bottom up adaptation	2021	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763220	222530	2021.18799	Evolution of the Seismic Response of Monopile-Supported Offshore Wind Turbines of Increasing Size from 5 to 15 MW including Dynamic Soil-Structure Interaction	As a result of wind power's expansion over the globe, offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are being projected in seismic prone areas. In parallel, the industry develops increasingly larger and more powerful generators. Many of the seismic response analyses of wind turbines conducted so far only consider smaller units. In this paper, a finite element substructuring model in frequency domain is used to compute the seismic response of four reference OWTs from 5 to 15 MW founded on monopiles embedded in several homogeneous soil profiles with shear wave velocities from 100 to 300 m/s and subjected to different accelerograms. The foundation behaviour is obtained through a continuum model including kinematic and inertial interaction. The relevance of soil-structure interaction and main trends of the seismic response of OWTs are inferred from the presented results. Although the seismic maximum bending moments increase with the size of the OWT system, their relevance with respect to the ones produced by design loads decreases as the turbine gets bigger. The same effect is observed for the shear forces if the soil is soft enough. The inclusion of SSI effects almost duplicates the seismic response when compared to the rigid base scenario.	offshore wind turbines; soil-structure interaction; seismic loading; monopile; structural response	2021	Laurent	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91763226	244708	2020.18206	Just adaptation? Generating new vulnerabilities and shaping adaptive capacities through the politics of climate-related resettlement in a Philippine coastal city	Drawing on the adaptation, justice, and resettlement literatures, this study explores the prospects for procedural (who is involved, how they are selected) and distributive justice (how the outcomes are experienced by different groups) in a resettlement project in the coastal city of Iloilo in the Philippines. This project, which sought to reduce flood risks, required the resettlement of 3500 families. The city was lauded locally and internationally and the government intends to replicate it across the country. This study uses a mixed method approach, including 200 household surveys and interviews with government officials, NGO staff, and community members. It finds that while some households experience notable improvements in their housing quality, incomes and climate resilience, the resettlement process exacerbated intra-community inequality and exclusion. It also finds that the distribution of these benefits was a function of political power and pre-existing wealth discrepancies rather than of need. To avoid these mistakes in the future, governments and resettlement planners must take account of how inequality and asymmetries in power shape resettlement outcomes. To do this, questions of procedural, distributive and contextual justice must be brought to the fore.	resettlement; fairness; climate change; displacement; philippines	2020	Laurent	Devi	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763243	330352	2017.12320	The importance of forecasting regional wind power ramping: A case study for the UK	In recent years there has been a significant change in the distribution of wind farms in Great Britain, with a trend towards very large offshore farms clustered together in zones. However, there are concerns these clusters could produce large ramping events on time scales of less than 6 h as local meteorological phenomena simultaneously impact the production of several farms. This paper presents generation data from the wind farms in the Thames Estuary (the largest cluster in the world) for 2014 and quantifies the high frequency power ramps. Based on a case study of a ramping event which occurred on 3rd November 2014, we show that due to the large capacity of the cluster, a localised ramp can have a significant impact on the cost of balancing the power system on a national level if it is not captured by the forecast of the system operator. The planned construction of larger offshore wind zones will exacerbate this problem. Consequently, there is a need for accurate regional wind power forecasts to minimise the costs of managing the system. This study shows that state-of-the-art high resolution forecast models have capacity to provide valuable information to mitigate this impact.

91763249	9576	2020.1169	A procedure for the resilience mapping in urban systems exposed to natural hazard: The Ischia Island (southern Italy) test area	A procedure to operationalize the environmental component of urban resilience in areas increasingly exposed to hazardous events, often intensified by climate changes, is here proposed. The procedure was implemented in a Geographic Information System framework named ``Resilience and Disaster Risk Management{''} that manages spatial and non-spatial data through the implementation of workflows aimed at streamlining and standardizing all the steps. Indices and indicators are used to semi-quantitatively assess the environmental driver that, along with economic, social and institutional component, governs the direction of the urban system. The indicators/indices were here investigated and mapped at the census district scale. The procedure was tested at Ischia Island (Southern Italy) exposed to volcanic, seismic, landslide, flood and coastal erosion hazards. The spatial variability of environmental resilience is shown into 13 maps that discretize the island into high, medium and low resilience classes. They resulted valid tools to prepare the urban system to possible future hazardous events during the mitigation phase of disaster-risk management (long term) but also to illustrate the capacity of a system to respond/withstand and react in the response and recovery phases (short term). The mapping procedure can be applied to larger areas at risk keeping the censual districts as the minimum territorial reference units or using municipal, regional or national administrative units. The expected integration of resilience assessment in territorial planning (e.g. Regional Territorial Plan, Provincial Territorial Plan, and Municipality Territorial Plan) could greatly benefit from the outcomes of the present research for overcoming sectoral approaches in territorial management.	resilience mapping; natural hazard; disaster risk management; ischia island	2020	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763261	60815	2022.6142	Beyond habitat boundaries: Organic matter cycling requires a system-wide approach for accurate blue carbon accounting	As coastal ecosystems become widely recognized for their capacity to sequester carbon (blue carbon), standard accounting methodologies for the generation of carbon credits are being developed. To ensure the applicability of these standards across blue carbon ecosystems, we investigated organic carbon provenance and burial in salt marshes and seagrass meadows of an arid, upwelling-dominated Eastern Pacific lagoon. We found low carbon density in benthic sediments of Bahia de San Quintin (5.9 +/- 0.5 mg C cm(-3)), only marginally higher in Zostera marina beds (6.9 +/- 0.5 mg C cm(-3)), likely due to remineralization and hydrodynamically driven export of seagrass material, resulting in low carbon burial rates (4.5 +/- 2.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Sediment organic carbon is mainly controlled by the fraction of fine sediment and its source is largely allochthonous, although sources differ spatially. Salt marshes at San Quintin derive 40\% of their organic matter from autochthonous material and exhibit higher carbon burial rates (up to 414.7 +/- 28.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and sediment carbon densities (32.0 +/- 0.7 mg C cm(-3)) compared to benthic sediments. This study emphasizes the connectivity of blue carbon habitats with marsh plant detritus supplementing benthic carbon burial and incorporation of detrital eelgrass in marsh sediments. Our findings highlight the importance of allochthonous organic matter for carbon sequestration in blue carbon habitats, suggesting standard accounting practices that deduct allochthonous organic matter would miss the full potential for carbon burial.

91763263	18093	2021.2241	Coastal wetland ecosystems deliver large carbon stocks in tropical Mexico	Tropical wetlands are important in the global carbon (C) cycle and climate system. To elaborate government policies that protect wetland ecosystem services, spatially explicit data on the existing C stocks are needed. This study quantified above and below ground C stocks in mangrove, swamp forests, marshes, and grazed wetlands in three different regions in Mexico (Veracruz, Tabasco/Campeche, and Chiapas states), using a combination of remote sensing techniques and field data collection. We report a 0.688 Gt C stock in the areas investigated showing that these wetlands hold important C stocks. The total C stock of Mexico's wetlands is expected to be considerably larger as our study is not a complete survey of Mexico's total wetland area. Across the three regions, the currently unprotected swamp forests and marshes had substantial peat deposits storing approximate to 0.232 and 0.375 Pg C, respectively. The high C stocks found in swamp forests (1801 +/- 283 Mg C ha(-1)) and marshes (1100 +/- 376 Mg C ha(-1)) are likely to be vulnerable to human interventions such as drainage. Flooded grasslands, used for grazing, had substantially lower C storage (271 +/- 122 Mg C ha(-1)), showing that grazed areas are less effective as C stores. Across sites the belowground C pool that was two orders of magnitude greater than the aboveground biomass C stocks. Carbon storage in wetland vegetation types differed among the three study regions, indicating the need for developing government policies considering a specific regional approach to protect the C stocks of coastal wetlands. Given that freshwater swamps had the greatest C stocks and freshwater marshes stored most C, these wetland peat deposits should be prioritized for conservation, via new legislation or inclusion in payment for ecosystem services schemes.	carbon storage; vegetation; mexico; land use change; peat; wetland	2021	Laurent	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

91763270	239936	2008.3121	Vulnerability assessment of the impact of sea-level rise and flooding on the Moroccan coast: The case of the Mediterranean eastern zone	The eastern part of the Mediterranean coast of Morocco is physically and socio-economically vulnerable to accelerated sea-level rise, due to its low topography and its high ecological and touristic value. Assessment of the potential land loss by inundation has been based on empirical approaches using a minimum inundation level of 2 m and a maximum inundation level of 7 m, where scenarios for future sea-level rise range from 200 to 860 mm, with a `best estimate' of 490 mm. The socio-economic impacts have been based on two possible alternative futures: (1) a `worst-case' scenario, obtained by combining the `economic development first' scenario with the maximum inundation level; and (2) a `best-case' scenario, by combining the `sustainability first' scenario with the minimum inundation level. Inundation analysis, based on Geographical Information Systems and a modelling approach to erosion, has identified both locations and the socioeconomic sectors that are most at risk to accelerated sea-level rise. Results indicate that 24\% and 59\% of the area will be lost by flooding at minimum and maximum inundation levels, respectively. The most severely impacted sectors are expected to be the residential and recreational areas, agricultural land, and the natural ecosystem. Shoreline erosion will affect 50\% and 70\% of the total area in 2050 and 2100, respectively. Potential strategies to ameliorate the impact of seawater inundation include: wetland preservation; beach nourishment at tourist resorts; and the afforestation of dunes. As this coast is planned to become one of the most developed tourist resorts in Morocco by 2010, measures such as building regulation, urban growth planning and development of an Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan, are recommended for the region.

91763277	250042	2017.7051	A conceptual framework for governing and managing key flows in a source-to-sea continuum	Current approaches to environmental protection and development on land, along rivers and coastal zones, and in marine environments are struggling to effectively promote sustainability. This is partly due to limited understanding of how ecosystems are linked, and partly due to fragmented governance and management arrangements in the continuum from source to sea that hinders cooperation and strategic overview across connected systems. Meanwhile, the key flows that link ecosystems are being altered by climate change and by an intensification of human activities, which are also expanding offshore where management regimes are typically weak or nonexistent. This paper presents a conceptual framework to guide the design of future initiatives aimed at supporting green and blue growth in source-to-sea systems. It includes a taxonomy of key flows, elements to guide analysis and planning and a common framework for elaborating a theory of change. Assembling a governance baseline and engaging stakeholders are critical elements in the approach. The conceptual framework builds on recent experiences of pro-sustainability action in source-to-sea systems around the world, and the paper applies the theory of change framework to selected case studies in order to develop further insights.	governance; integrated management; marine; river basin; sustainable development; system linkages	2017	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763283	1756	2021.232	Importance of Protection Service Against Erosion and Storm Events Provided by Coastal Ecosystems Under Climate Change Scenarios	Increasing sea level rise (SLR), and frequency and intensity of storms, paired with degrading ecosystems, are exposing coastal areas to higher risks of damage by storm events. Coastal natural habitats, such as dunes or saltmarshes, can reduce exposure of coastlines to these events and help to reduce the impacts and the potential damage to coastal property. The goal of our study was to evaluate the current vulnerability of the Portuguese northern coast to erosion and flooding caused by extreme events and to assess the contribution of natural habitats in reducing both vulnerability and property damages considering SLR scenarios. The Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) Coastal Vulnerability model was used to produce an Exposure Index (EI) for the northern Portuguese coastline, for the current situation, and for future International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, considering the presence and absence of coastal habitats. Results showed an increase in exposure with rising sea levels and expansion of high vulnerability areas. Coastal habitats contributed to a 28\% reduction of high exposed segments for the Current scenario, corresponding to a potential reduction of coastal property damage of 105 Meuro during extreme events. For the SLR scenarios, coastal habitats could potentially reduce the amount of property damage by 190 Meuro in 2050 and 285 Meuro in 2100, considering RCP8.5 projections. This study highlighted the importance of natural habitats in protecting vulnerable coastlines and reducing the potential damages to properties from flooding. Such results can be incorporated in management plans and support decision-making toward implementing an ecosystem-based approach to increase the resilience of coastal communities to cope with future environmental changes.</p>	coastal ecosystem services; coastal protection; coastal management; sea level rise (slr); northern portugal	2021	Laurent	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91763285	722	2009.26	Caribbean beach changes and climate change adaptation	Beach monitoring data are presented and show an average beach erosion trend of 0.5 m yr -1 in eight Caribbean islands over the period 1985-2000, with elevated rates in those islands impacted by a higher number of hurricanes. The data are based on 5 to 15 years of continuous monitoring, conducted at three-month intervals, at 113 beaches (200 profile sites) on eight islands, using standard methodology. The causes of the erosion are discussed and include anthropogenic factors, climate variability and projected climate change. Based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections for the Caribbean region, and the likely increase of anthropogenic stresses such as coastal development, it is likely that the beach erosion trend will continue and increase. Nonexclusive approaches to help beaches adapt to climate change include structural, planning or ecological measures. Two case studies illustrating climate change adaptation measures are discussed, one focuses on coastal planning measures in Anguilla and Nevis, and the second focuses on ecological measures, specifically the rehabilitation of a coastal forest in Puerto Rico. These case studies have not reached a stage where their effectiveness can be evaluated, however preliminary outcomes show that community-based climate change adaptation measures require careful planning such that the entire community is involved in a participatory manner and sufficient time is allocated for awareness-raising, information-sharing and discussion.

91763304	263166	2016.1302	Mangrove biomass carbon stock mapping of the Karimunjawa Islands using multispectral remote sensing	Among vegetated coastal habitats, mangrove forests are among the densest carbon pools. They store their organic carbon in the surrounding soil and thus the sequestered carbon stays in the sediment for a long time and cannot be easily returned to the atmosphere. Additionally, mangroves also provide various important ecosystem services in coastal areas and surroundings. Accordingly, it is important to understand the distribution of biomass carbon stock in mangrove habitats in a spatial and temporal context, not only to reduce CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, but also for their sustainability. The objectives of this research are to map the mangrove carbon stock and estimate the total biomass carbon stock sheltered by mangrove forests, with the Karimunjawa Islands as a study site, using the widely available passive remote sensing system ALOS AVNIR-2. The modelling and mapping of mangrove carbon stock incorporates the integration of image pixel values and mangroves field data via empirical modelling. Vegetation indices and PC bands at different levels of radiometric corrections were all used as the input in the mangrove carbon stock modelling so that the effectiveness and sensitivity of different image transformations to particular radiometric correction levels could be analysed and understood. Afterward, the accuracy and effectiveness of each mangrove carbon stock-mapping routine was compared and evaluated. The accuracy of the best mangrove above-ground carbon stock (AGC) map modelled from vegetation index is 77.1% (EVI1, SE 5.89Â kgÂ CÂ mâˆ’2), and for mangrove below-ground carbon stock (BGC) it is 60.0% (GEMI, SE 2.54Â kgÂ CÂ mâˆ’2). The mangrove carbon stock map from ALOS AVNIR-2 PC bands showed a maximum accuracy of 77.8% (PC2, SE 5.71Â kgÂ CÂ mâˆ’2) and 60.8% (PC2, SE 2.48Â kgÂ CÂ mâˆ’2) for AGC and BGC respectively. From the resulting maps, the Karimunjawa Islands are estimated to shelter 96,482 tonnes C of mangroves AGC with a mean value of 21.64Â kgÂ CÂ mâˆ’2 and 24,064 tonnes C of mangroves BGC with a mean value of 5.39Â kgÂ CÂ mâˆ’2. Potentially, there are approximately 120,546 tonnes C of mangrove biomass carbon stock in the Karimunjawa Islands. Remote-sensing reflectance can successfully model mangrove carbon stock based on the relationship between mangrove canopy properties, represented by leaf area index (LAI) and the tree or root biomass carbon stock. The accuracy of the mangrove carbon stock map is subject to errors, which are sourced mainly from: (1) the absence of a species-specific biomass allometric equation for several species present in the study area; (2) the generalized standard conversion value of mangrove biomass to mangrove carbon stock; (3) the relationship between mangrove reflectance and mangrove LAI; (4) the relationship between mangrove reflectance and above-ground mangrove biomass and carbon stock due to its relationship with LAI; (5) the relationship between mangrove LAI and mangrove below-ground parts; (6) the inability to perform mangrove carbon stock modelling at the species level due to the complexities of the mangrove forest in the study area; (7) background reflectance and atmospheric path radiance that could not be completely minimized using image radiometric corrections and transformations; and (8) spatial displacement between the actual location of the mangrove forest in the field and the corresponding pixel in the image. The availability of mangrove biomass carbon stock maps is beneficial for carrying out various management activities, and is also very important for the resilience of mangroves to changing environments.

91763327	244203	2021.7735	A physical model simulation of combination of a geo-bag dike and mangrove vegetation as a natural coastal protection system for the Indonesian shoreline	To mitigate coastal erosion, coastal regions worldwide focus on sustainable coastal development practices. To this end, many countries use natural protective methods, including the use of vegetation such as mangroves. However, this practice is challenging. For example, mangrove seedlings are often damaged by sea waves before they can grow strong enough to protect coastal lines, and hence they require protection for at least two years after planting. In this study, a coastal protection system combining a main natural structure and a temporary artificial structure is proposed. The effectiveness of this method is related to the deep-water steepness of the incoming waves and the transmitted wave parameters. The transmitted waves consist of two parts: waves transmitted after the water has passed through the artificial system, and those transmitted after it has passed through the mangroves. The first part affects the juvenile mangroves, whereas the latter affects the shoreline. To identify natural coastal protection methods applicable to Indonesia, wave steepness data specific to Indonesian waters were derived using data from an online open database. After weighing the alternatives for temporary human-made structures, the geo-bag dike was chosen. The effects of various geo-bag-dike configurations and geo-bag unit weights on wave height reduction were quantified. Laboratory experiments were conducted on a narrow wave flume using a mangrove model as the main structure and geo-textile-geo-bag models as temporary artificial structures. Based on the dimensionless wave steepness data, the wave conditions of Indonesian waters were produced in the laboratory. This study determined the most effective geo-bag-dike configuration to reduce the wave height, which affects juvenile mangroves, and to decrease the height of transmitted waves after they have passed through mangroves, which cause shoreline erosion. The results reveal that the effectiveness of a temporary geo-bag-dike structure significantly depends on the incoming wave height and the dimensionless wave steepness. The steeper the waves are, the greater the reduction in the transmitted wave height. The results also showed that the reduction in wave height due to the presence of a geo-bag-dike structure varied between 2\% and 65\% in front of the juvenile mangroves and between 8\% and 71\% after the waves passed through them. The most effective geo-bag-dike configuration uses relatively heavy geo-bag units with a moderate dike slope of 1:2.0. The reduction significantly depended on the wave parameters, slope, and unit weight.	natural coastal protection; mangroves protection; geo-bag dike; coastal sustainability	2021	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91763332	347083	2013.9832	Nonlinear dynamics of a tightly moored point-absorber wave energy converter	Tightly moored single-body floating devices are an important class of offshore wave energy converters. Examples are the devices under development at the University of Uppsala, Sweden, and Oregon State University, USA, prototypes of which were recently tested. These devices are equipped with a linear electrical generator. The mooring system consists of a cable that is kept tight by a spring or equivalent device. This cable also prevents the buoy from drifting away by providing a horizontal restoring force. The horizontal and (to a lesser extent) the vertical restoring forces are nonlinear functions of the horizontal and vertical displacements of the buoy, which makes the system a nonlinear one (even if the spring and damper are linear), whose modelling requires a time-domain analysis. Such an analysis is presented, preceded, for comparison purposes, by a simpler frequency-domain approach. Numerical results (motions and absorbed power) are shown for a system consisting of a hemispherical buoy in regular and irregular waves and a tight mooring cable. The power take-off is modelled by a simplified system of a linear spring and a linear damper and also by a system formed by a hydraulic piston and spring. Different scenarios are analysed.

However, the use of story maps in the context of climate services has not yet been widely explored or implemented. In this study we present a story map for communicating the potential impacts of flooding due to sea-level rise for the city of Flensburg, situated at the German Baltic Sea coast. The map is developed in the form of a web-based tool and includes background information on sea-level rise and coastal flooding as well as on coastal adaptation measures; interactive maps with information on city landmarks; and maps of future flooding scenarios based on numerical modelling. To increase the usability of the climate service we have applied a co-production approach and collaborated with the general public to identify user needs in an iterative process. Our study highlights the user needs for detailed visualisation of potential flooding due to sea-level rise as well as for further information on adaptation measures. As a climate service, our story map serves as a starting point for raising awareness among the general public and for initiating action for adaptation to reduce vulnerability to coastal flooding in Flensburg.	co-production; story map; coastal flooding; sea-level rise; user needs; climate service product	2021	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763334	2876	2004.59	Landscape-scale socio-economics of sea-level rise	Flooding due to sea-level rise resulting from climate may have serious socio-economic consequences. Socio-economic impacts of an accelerated sea-level rise are often described at an aggregated spatial level that is useful for inter-regional or international comparisons, but this is of limited value for determining local effects. Local effects need to be based on the local attributes of coastal vulnerability at the landscape level, especially if effects on the natural environment are of particular interest. In analysing the socio-economics of sea-level rise at the landscape scale, it is also important to consider how humans might adapt to any risks. This paper gives an overview of the methodologies used for socio-economic studies carried out at a regional level and places the results of the studies in the context of waterbirds and the environment. A German study made at the landscape level, using a multidisciplinary approach to deal with the various possible effects of sea-level rise, is discussed. The economic impacts of sea-level rise may be lowered by our ability to adapt to the changes. The options of whether to protect, retreat or accommodate, however, may affect the effects of sea-level rise on coastal habitats and the bird populations that they support. Strengthening of embankments and the creation of storm surge barriers and dams, for example, might lead to the reduction of intertidal and saltmarsh habitats and their associated bird populations. Managed retreat, by contrast, may prevent the loss of these habitats. The decision as to which option is chosen, however, is likely to be largely influenced by local economic considerations.

91763335	346975	2013.8534	Accuracy of the actuator disc-RANS approach for predicting the performance and wake of tidal turbines	The actuator disc-RANS model has widely been used in wind and tidal energy to predict the wake of a horizontal axis turbine. The model is appropriate where large-scale effects of the turbine on a flow are of interest, for example, when considering environmental impacts, or arrays of devices. The accuracy of the model for modelling the wake of tidal stream turbines has not been demonstrated, and flow predictions presented in the literature for similar modelled scenarios vary significantly. This paper compares the results of the actuator disc-RANS model, where the turbine forces have been derived using a blade-element approach, to experimental data measured in the wake of a scaled turbine. It also compares the results with those of a simpler uniform actuator disc model. The comparisons show that the model is accurate and can predict up to 94 per cent of the variation in the experimental velocity data measured on the centreline of the wake, therefore demonstrating that the actuator disc-RANS model is an accurate approach for modelling a turbine wake, and a conservative approach to predict performance and loads. It can therefore be applied to similar scenarios with confidence. Â© 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

91813129	112438	2019.8881	Key Challenges in Advancing an Ecosystem-Based Approach to Marine Spatial Planning Under Economic Growth Imperatives	In 2017, South Africa became the first African country to draft Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) legislation. The underlying legal framework supports the achievement of ecological, social and economic objectives, but a national policy to fast track the oceans economy provides a challenge for ecosystem-based approaches to MSP. During the 2018 International Marine Conservation Congress, we convened a session to present particular challenges that will likely apply to any developing country seeking to increase profits from existing, or proposed, marine activities. Here we present six multi-disciplinary research projects that support ecosystem-based approaches to MSP in South Africa, by addressing the following knowledge gaps and specific key challenges: (1) the lack of data-derived measurements of ecosystem condition (and the need to validate commonly-used proxy measures); (2) the need to develop models to better understand the potential impacts of climate change on food webs and fisheries; (3) the slow implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, and the need to implement existing legal instruments that can support such an approach; (4) the paucity of evidence supporting dynamic ocean management strategies; (5) the requirement to manage conflicting objectives in growing marine tourism industries; and (6) the need to adopt systems thinking approaches to support integrated ocean management. We provide examples of specific research projects designed to address these challenges. The ultimate goal of this research is to advance a more integrated approach to ocean management in South Africa, using tools that can be applied in countries with similar socio-political and environmental contexts.	ecosystem condition; oceans economy; climate change; dynamic ocean management; scenario planning; system dynamics models; complex systems; trade-offs	2019	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91813130	255975	2018.4294	Constraining Marsh Carbon Budgets Using Long-Term C Burial and Contemporary Atmospheric CO2 Fluxes	Salt marshes are sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide that respond to environmental changes related to sea level rise and climate. Here we assess how climatic variations affect marsh-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide in the short term and compare it to long-term burial rates based on radiometric dating. The 5Â years of atmospheric measurements show a strong interannual variation in atmospheric carbon exchange, varying from âˆ’104 to âˆ’233Â gÂ CÂ mâˆ’2Â aâˆ’1 with a mean of âˆ’179Â Â±Â 32Â gÂ CÂ mâˆ’2Â aâˆ’1. Variation in these annual sums was best explained by differences in rainfall early in the growing season. In the two years with below average rainfall in June, both net uptake and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were less than in the other three years. Measurements in 2016 and 2017 suggest that the mechanism behind this variability may be rainfall decreasing soil salinity which has been shown to strongly control productivity. The net ecosystem carbon balance was determined as burial rate from four sediment cores using radiometric dating and was lower than the net uptake measured by eddy covariance (mean: 110Â Â±Â 13Â gÂ CÂ mâˆ’2Â aâˆ’1). The difference between these estimates was significant and may be because the atmospheric measurements do not capture lateral carbon fluxes due to tidal exchange. Overall, it was smaller than values reported in the literature for lateral fluxes and highlights the importance of investigating lateral C fluxes in future studies. Â©2018.

91813132	36686	2009.1167	Impact of enhanced vertical mixing on marine biogeochemistry: lessons for geo-engineering and natural variability	Artificially enhanced vertical mixing has been suggested as a means by which to fertilize the biological pump with subsurface nutrients and thus increase the oceanic CO2 sink. We use an ocean general circulation and biogeochemistry model (OGCBM) to examine the impact of artificially enhanced vertical mixing on biological productivity and atmospheric CO2, as well as the climatically significant gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and dimethyl sulphide (DMS) during simulations between 2000 and 2020. Overall, we find a large increase in the amount of organic carbon exported from surface waters, but an overall increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations by 2020. We quantified the individual effect of changes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), alkalinity and biological production on the change in pCO(2) at characteristic sites and found the increased vertical supply of carbon rich subsurface water to be primarily responsible for the enhanced CO2 outgassing, although increased alkalinity and, to a lesser degree, biological production can compensate in some regions. While ocean-atmosphere fluxes of DMS do increase slightly, which might reduce radiative forcing, the oceanic N2O source also expands. Our study has implications for understanding how natural variability in vertical mixing in different ocean regions (such as that observed recently in the Southern Ocean) can impact the ocean CO2 sink via changes in DIC, alkalinity and carbon export.

Our coupled carbon-climate model simulations suggest that artificial upwelling may, under most optimistic assumptions, be able to sequester atmospheric CO2 at a rate of about 0.9 PgC/yr. However, the model predicts that about 80% of the carbon sequestered is stored on land, as a result of reduced respiration at lower air temperatures brought about by upwelling of cold waters. This remote and distributed carbon sequestration would make monitoring and verification particularly challenging. A second caveat predicted by our simulations is that whenever artificial upwelling is stopped, simulated surface temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise quickly and for decades to centuries to levels even somewhat higher than experienced in a world that never engaged in artificial upwelling.	air temperature;  anthropogenic carbon dioxide;  artificial upwelling;  atmospheric co;  carbon sequestration;  climate model simulations;  cold waters;  ocean fertilization;  surface temperatures;  air temperature;  anthropogenic carbon dioxide;  artificial upwelling;  carbon sequestration;  climate model simulations;  geoengineering;  ocean fertilization;  surface temperatures, atmospheric temperature;  carbon dioxide;  oceanography;  atmospheric temperature;  carbon dioxide, climate models;  climate models, air temperature;  anthropogenic source;  atmosphere-ocean coupling;  carbon dioxide;  carbon sequestration;  climate modeling;  fertilization (reproduction);  marine atmosphere;  upwelling	2010	Laurent	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91813134	13052	2014.710	Potential climate engineering effectiveness and side effects during a high carbon dioxide-emission scenario	The realization that mitigation efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions have, until now, been relatively ineffective has led to an increasing interest in climate engineering as a possible means of preventing the potentially catastrophic consequences of climate change. While many studies have addressed the potential effectiveness of individual methods there have been few attempts to compare them. Here we use an Earth system model to compare the effectiveness and side effects of afforestation, artificial ocean upwelling, ocean iron fertilization, ocean alkalinization and solar radiation management during a high carbon dioxide-emission scenario. We find that even when applied continuously and at scales as large as currently deemed possible, all methods are, individually, either relatively ineffective with limited (<8\%) warming reductions, or they have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change. Our simulations suggest that the potential for these types of climate engineering to make up for failed mitigation may be very limited.

91813135	131139	2018.7686	Improved fisheries management could offset many negative effects of climate change	The world's oceans supply food and livelihood to billions of people, yet species' shifting geographic ranges and changes in productivity arising from climate change are expected to profoundly affect these benefits. We ask how improvements in fishery management can offset the negative consequences of climate change; we find that the answer hinges on the current status of stocks. The poor current status of many stocks combined with potentially maladaptive responses to range shifts could reduce future global fisheries yields and profits even more severely than previous estimates have suggested. However, reforming fisheries in ways that jointly fix current inefficiencies, adapt to fisheries productivity changes, and proactively create effective transboundary institutions could lead to a future with higher profits and yields compared to what is produced today.

91813136	246784	2019.16420	Managed retreat through voluntary buyouts of flood-prone properties	Retreat from some areas will become unavoidable under intensifying climate change. Existing deployments of managed retreat are at small scale compared to potential future needs, leaving open questions about where, when, and how retreat under climate change will occur. Here, we analyze more than 40,000 voluntary buyouts of flood-prone properties in the United States, in which homeowners sell properties to the government and the land is restored to open space. In contrast to model-based evaluation of potential future retreat, local governments in counties with higher population and income are more likely to administer buyouts. The bought-out properties themselves, however, are concentrated in areas of greater social vulnerability within these counties, pointing to the importance of assessing the equity of buyout implementation and outcomes. These patterns demonstrate the challenges associated with locally driven implementation of managed retreat and the potential benefits of experimentation with different approaches to retreat.

Here, we present organic carbon (C) storage in VCE across Australian climate regions and estimate potential annual CO2 emission benefits of VCE conservation and restoration. Australia contributes 5-11\% of the C stored in VCE globally (70-185 Tg C in aboveground biomass, and 1,055-1,540 Tg C in the upper 1 m of soils). Potential CO2 emissions from current VCE losses are estimated at 2.1-3.1 Tg CO2-e yr(-1), increasing annual CO2 emissions from land use change in Australia by 12-21\%. This assessment, the most comprehensive for any nation to-date, demonstrates the potential of conservation and restoration of VCE to underpin national policy development for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

91813138	13772	2019.1445	Fingerprinting Blue Carbon: Rationale and Tools to Determine the Source of Organic Carbon in Marine Depositional Environments	Blue carbon is the organic carbon in oceanic and coastal ecosystems that is captured on centennial to millennial timescales. Maintaining and increasing blue carbon is an integral component of strategies to mitigate global warming. Marine vegetated ecosystems (especially seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, and tidal marshes) are blue carbon hotspots and their degradation and loss worldwide have reduced organic carbon stocks and increased CO2 emissions. Carbon markets, and conservation and restoration schemes aimed at enhancing blue carbon sequestration and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions, will be aided by knowing the provenance and fate of blue carbon. We review and critique current methods and the potential of nascent methods to track the provenance and fate of organic carbon, including: bulk isotopes, compound-specific isotopes, biomarkers, molecular properties, and environmental DNA (eDNA). We find that most studies to date have used bulk isotopes to determine provenance, but this approach often cannot distinguish the contribution of different primary producers to organic carbon in depositional marine environments. Based on our assessment, we recommend application of multiple complementary methods. In particular, the use of carbon and nitrogen isotopes of lipids along with eDNA have a great potential to identify the source and quantify the contribution of different primary producers to sedimentary organic carbon in marine ecosystems. Despite the promising potential of these new techniques, further research is needed to validate them. This critical overview can inform future research to help underpin methodologies for the implementation of blue carbon focused climate change mitigation schemes.	blue carbon; carbon accounting; environmental dna; isotopes; organic carbon; sequestration	2019	Laurent	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91813139	329345	2017.12046	Analysis of the environmental issues concerning the deployment of an OTEC power plant in Martinique	Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is a form of power generation, which exploits the temperature difference between warm surface seawater and cold deep seawater. Suitable conditions for OTEC occur in deep warm seas, especially the Caribbean, the Red Sea and parts of the Indo-Pacific Ocean. The continuous power provided by this renewable power source makes a useful contribution to a renewable energy mix because of the intermittence of the other major renewable power sources, i.e. solar or wind power. Industrial-scale OTEC power plants have simply not been built. However, recent innovations and greater political awareness of power transition to renewable energy sources have strengthened the support for such power plants and, after preliminary studies in the Reunion Island (Indian Ocean), the Martinique Island (West Indies) has been selected for the development of the first full-size OTEC power plant in the world, to be a showcase for testing and demonstration. An OTEC plant, even if the energy produced is cheap, calls for high initial capital investment. However, this technology is of interest mainly in tropical areas where funding is limited. The cost of innovations to create an operational OTEC plant has to be amortized, and this technology remains expensive. This paper will discuss the heuristic, technical and socio-economic limits and consequences of deploying an OTEC plant in Martinique to highlight respectively the impact of the OTEC plant on the environment the impact of the environment on the OTEC plant. After defining OTEC, we will describe the different constraints relating to the setting up of the first operational-scale plant worldwide. This includes the investigations performed (reporting declassified data), the political context and the local acceptance of the project. We will then provide an overview of the processes involved in the OTEC plant and discuss the feasibility of future OTEC installations. We will also list the extensive marine investigations required prior to installation and the dangers of setting up OTEC plants in inappropriate locations.

91760475	193	NA.1	Coastal resident perceptions of nature-based adaptation options in Nova Scotia	Climate change risks to coastal communities may overwhelm current management strategies. The emergence of nature-based solutions could provide alternative approaches for climate adaptation; however, studies on their public acceptability are limited. This research focuses on the human dimensions of nature-based coastal adaptation solutions. The research sought to understand the kind of environmental changes participants were experiencing in their coastal communities of Nova Scotia and what management responses they observed being taken, if any. Online focus groups were held with coastal property owners in Nova Scotia to understand how they assess coastal risks and four approaches to nature-based coastal adaptation: living shorelines, accommodation, retreat, and dyke realignment to make space for wetland restoration. Results revealed ongoing trust in traditional hard-line approaches, but also interest in knowing more about nature-based options. There was general support for living shorelines, albeit with scepticism; a concern that accommodation is just a ``band-aid{''} approach; resistance to retreat, despite general recognition of its future utility; and a lack of understanding of dyke realignment. The successful implementation of nature-based coastal adaptation approaches will require more evidence of their viability, better options for financing them, and engagement with communities around the best-fit alternatives for them.	climate change; coastal adaptation; coastal flooding; maritime provinces; sea-level rise	NA	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760476	300079	2021.2540	A model for estimating the carbon footprint of maritime transportation of Liquefied Natural Gas under uncertainty	The demand for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in the global markets has changed significantly. As a result, industries have been forced to consider investing significantly in supply chains to achieve an efficient distribution of LNG for cost efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. To minimize the contribution of LNG maritime transportation to global climate change, there is a need to quantify the carbon footprints systematically. In this research, we developed a novel and practical model for estimating the carbon footprint for LNG maritime transport. Using the MATLAB program, an uncertainty-based carbon footprint accounting framework is created. The Monte Carlo simulation model is built to conduct a carbon footprint analysis while the main input parameters were changed within a reliable range. Later, a multivariate sensitivity analysis is performed using the Risk Solver software to estimate the most significant parameters on the net carbon footprints. The sensitivity analysis results showed that that steam process day and steaming fuel consumption are found to be the most sensitive parameters for the overall carbon footprint for both Laden and Ballast trips. Furthermore, it was found that the Q-Max vessel produces more carbon emissions when compared to the Q-Flex, although both are traveling the same distance and are using the same fuel type. The type of fuel is also significantly affecting the emission values due to the relevant carbon content in the fuel. Like the case of the two conventional vessels, the one that is running with the only LNG is found to have fewer emissions when compared to the one run with dual-mode.

Based on the causal analysis of the historical typhoon cases in the Guangdong Province of China, this study indicates that structural measures alone are not sufficient to resist and offset the impacts caused by typhoon disasters. Additionally, structural measures are unsustainable due to their high investment and low security. Adaptive governance, which uses non-structural measures and resilience building, is a feasible and cost-effective strategy for responding to the cascading effects of typhoon disasters. Multi-stakeholder participation and vertical-horizontal coordination are essential for providing adaptive governance to typhoon disasters. A risk-sharing model was put forward by bringing together the government, insurance companies and victims. Furthermore, a favorable atmosphere for public participation in disaster risk reduction can be fostered and should be a long-term adaptation strategy. The views and frameworks of adaptive governance provide policy makers with insights on coastal disaster risk management within the broader context of climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

91760491	5285	2021.708	Improving the Climate Resilience of Rice Farming in Flood-Prone Areas through Azolla Biofertilizer and Saline-Tolerant Varieties	Rice farming in coastal areas is often victim to flooding as a result of climate change. Low-cost adaptation strategies are required to increase resilience and rice productivity in these flood-prone coastal areas. In this study, enriched Azolla extract (EAE) liquid biofertilizers, combined with selected stress-tolerant rice varieties, were tested in farmers' fields in Pangandaran, West Java from June to October 2020. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of EAE in increasing the yield of different rice varieties. The research was arranged as a split-plot design with five replications. The main plot was the EAE application (T1 = 3 ton ha(-1) compost and T2 = 3 ton ha(-1) compost + 10 L ha(-1) of EAE), and the sub-plots were stress-tolerant rice varieties (V1 = Inpari 43, V2 = Mawar, V3 = Inpari 30, V4 = Inpara 03, V5 = Mendawak). The application of EAE of 10 L ha(-1) significantly affected the rice grain yield, which was 37.06\% higher than that of the control plot. The average grain yield of the five varieties under EAE treatment (5.51 ton ha(-1)) was greater than the grain yield of local farmers' fields (3.78-4.97 ton ha(-1)). Inpari 43 had the highest grain yield with 5.90 ton ha(-1), but the yield was not significantly different from the Mendawak variety (4.90 ton ha(-1)). This result suggests that EAE and selected stress-tolerant rice varieties (Inpari 43 or Mendawak) are an effective adaptation strategy to increase rice farms' resilience and productivity in coastal areas prone to flooding.	enriched azolla extract (eae); liquid biofertilizer; saline-tolerant varieties; rice farming; flood; coastal area; climate change; indonesia	2021	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
91760493	521	2011.17	Modelling climate-change effects on Australian and Pacific aquatic ecosystems: a review of analytical tools and management implications	Climate change presents significant challenges to modelling and managing aquatic resources. Equilibrium assumptions common in many modelling approaches need to be replaced by formulations that allow for changing baselines and integration of ongoing changes and adaptations by species, ecosystems and humans. As ecosystems change, so will the ways humans use, monitor and manage them. Consequently, adaptive management loops and supporting tools deserve more prominence in the management toolbox. Models are critical tools for providing an early understanding of the challenges to be faced by integrating observations and examining possible solutions. We review modelling tools currently available to incorporate the effect of climate change on marine and freshwater ecosystems, and the implications for management of natural resources. System non-linearity can confound interpretations and hence adaptive management responses are needed that are robust to unexpected outcomes. An improvement in the ability to model the effects of climate change from a social and economic perspective is necessary. The outputs from `end-to-end' and socio-ecological models can potentially inform planning, in both Australia and the Pacific region, about how best to build resilience to climate change. In this context, the importance of well directed data-collection programs is also emphasised. Lessons from this region, which is advanced with regard to modelling approaches, can guide increased use of models to test options for managing aquatic resources worldwide.	adaptive management; australian fisheries; ecosystem models; end-to-end models; pacific island countries and territories; qualitative models; socioeconomics	2011	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760500	7104	2019.749	Coastal habitat squeeze: A review of adaptation solutions for saltmarsh, mangrove and beach habitats	Important intertidal coastal habitats - particularly mangroves, saltmarshes and beaches - are particularly threatened by the impacts of climate change-driven sea-level rise. Coastal development and coastal armoring present physical barriers for the natural inland migration of coastal habitats, and changes in hydrological connectivity reduce sediment inputs and the potential for vertical accretion. We identify mechanisms and enabling conditions to accommodate migration of these habitats in Australia and the United States. A range of financial, policy, planning and on-the-ground management tools in both countries that already exist, often for a different purpose, can be implemented or modified to also enable inland habitat migration. Awareness of approaches/solutions can assist land managers and policy makers to accommodate migration of habitats as a necessary component of coastal management in an era of increasing rates of sea level rise.	coastal policy; coastal planning; sea level rise; habitat migration; coastal ecosystems	2019	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760505	11579	2017.942	Resilience indicators support valuation of estuarine ecosystem restoration under climate change	Economic valuation of ecological restoration most often encompasses only the most tangible ecosystem service benefits, thereby omitting many difficult-to-measure benefits, including those derived from enhanced reliability of ecosystem services. Because climate change is likely to impose novel ecosystem stressors, a typical approach to valuing benefits may fail to capture the contribution of ecosystem resilience to sustaining long-term benefits. Unfortunately, we generally lack predictive probabilistic models that would enable measurement and valuation of resilience. Therefore, alternative measures are needed to complement monetary values and broaden understanding of restoration benefits. We use a case study of Chesapeake Bay restoration (total maximum daily load) to show that ecosystem service benefits that are typically monetized leave critical information gaps. To address these gaps, we review evidence for ecosystem services that can be quantified or described, including changes in harmful algal bloom risks. We further propose two integrative indicators of estuarine resilience-the extent of submerged aquatic vegetation and spatial distribution of fish. Submerged aquatic vegetation extent is indicative of qualities of ecosystems that promote positive feedbacks to water quality. Broadly distributed fish populations reduce risk by promoting diverse responses to spatially heterogeneous stresses. Our synthesis and new analyses for the Chesapeake Bay suggest that resilience metrics improve understanding of restoration benefits by demonstrating how nutrient and sediment load reductions will alleviate multiple sources of stress, thereby enhancing the system's capacity to absorb or adapt to extreme events or novel stresses.

91760508	22189	2019.2030	A generalisable integrated natural capital methodology for targeting investment in coastal defence	Coastal ecosystems, such as saltmarsh, produce a range of ecosystem services that underpin human well-being. In the UK, and globally, saltmarsh extent and quality is declining due to coastal squeeze, deteriorating water quality, and agricultural activities. Here, we develop a general framework to evaluate changes in coastal defence. Using this framework, we identify priority areas for saltmarsh re-alignment: re-creation of saltmarsh in areas that have been saltmarsh in the past - but that have been claimed for a variety of land uses, particularly agriculture. We base our re-alignment prioritisation on the ecosystem services provided by saltmarsh in the North Devon Biosphere Reserve: specifically carbon sequestration and recreational benefits, and the economic values of those services. We compare potential economic benefits with the economic costs of creating new saltmarsh areas - specifically lost agricultural output, property damages and direct re-alignment costs. We identify a number of priority areas for managed re-alignment that generate high recreational values in areas where properties would not be damaged. These findings provide a necessary and timely analysis for the managers of the North Devon Biosphere Reserve. Furthermore, we outline a comprehensive methodology to plan future management of coastal zones.	coastal planning; ecosystem services; managed re-alignment; natural capital; opportunity costs; saltmarsh	2019	Laurent	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760509	6315	2017.515	Collaborative Landscape Planning: Co-Design of Ecosystem-Based Land Management Scenarios	Land management in coastal areas has to cope with impacts of climate change and sea level rise. In Germany, landscape plans assess and organize the spatial allocation of land use as an environmental contribution to general spatial planning. Collaborative planning processes are important to develop sustainable and ecosystem-based strategies to make coastal landscapes climate proof. However, there is little experience with collaborative processes in practical planning in Germany, and probably in other countries as well. This paper conducts an empirical case study in the low-lying coastal areas of northwest Germany. During a collaborative landscape planning process, four different ecosystem-based land management scenarios have been co-designed by regional experts and researchers. The participatory and iterative process included the development of scenario narratives to define planning goals, the use of land use elements and their relations to ecosystem services as planning entities in terms of indicators, the art-based illustrations of the different scenarios, and an evaluation and monitoring of the outcomes by regional experts. The decision-maker group decided on the so-called ``actor-based{''} scenario, which contained freshwater retention areas (polders) to prevent potential uncontrolled flooding of the hinterland. This climate adaptation strategy has been implemented in the regional development plan of the county.	co-design; collaborative landscape planning; ecosystem-based management	2017	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760519	5667	2018.590	Resilience unpacked - framing of ``uncertainty' and ``adaptability' in long-term flood risk management strategies for London and Rotterdam	Resilience is held as a promising concept to produce a paradigm shift from traditional flood control to an integration of flood risk management and spatial planning. Central ideas to the resilience narrative are that nothing is certain except uncertainty itself' and adaptability' is key to governing the unknown'. However, this terminology is far from clear, yet increasingly used, which raises the question how it is made sense of in practice. To answer this question, we examine two long-term flood risk management strategies in the London and Rotterdam region with a policy framing perspective (i.e. the English Thames Estuary 2100 Plan and the Dutch Delta Programme). In both strategies, uncertainties are a key concern, leading to adaptive strategic plans. Reconstructing the framing processes shows that the English adopted a scientific pragmatism' frame and the Dutch a joint fact-finding' frame. While this led to different governance approaches, there are also striking parallels. Both cases use established methods such as scenario planning and monitoring to manage' uncertainties. Similarly to previous turns in flood risk management, the resilience narrative seems to be accommodated in a technical-rational way, resulting in policy strategies that are maintaining the status quo rather than bringing about a paradigm shift.	resilience; adaptive governance; framing; flood risk management; thames estuary 2100 plan; delta programme	2018	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760523	252823	2022.1927	Decision support methods for sustainable ship energy systems: A state-of-the-art review	The shipping sector has been under great pressure since the last decade to improve its environmental footprint, more so recently with the International Maritime Organisation target for a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, benchmarked to 2008 levels. These challenging goals have increased the interest towards alternative fuels and ship energy systems that can offer a more sustainable performance. The variety of potential technological solutions along with the multiple criteria employed to evaluate the ship energy systems with respect to sustainability considerations, renders the decision-making process for selecting ship energy systems challenging and highlights the need for dedicated decision support methods. This study presents a state-of-the-art review of the literature on decision support methods for enhancing the ship energy systems sustainability. The trends and gaps in the literature are identified, based on which, recommendations for future research are proposed.

The ship-based transport will make it possible to couple CO2 recovery plant and storage site without being limited to a single sink-source match, and decoupling and moving to another sink can be done with relative ease when necessary. It also removes the pipeline construction and removal activities in coastal zone where the social activities like fishery are often high. In this paper, the technical and economic feasibility of shuttle-type shipping and offshore operation for CO2 injection from the ship to the well(s) are studied. The main components needed for the proposed system are liquefaction of CO2, temporary storage at port, offloading, shuttle ship with Dynamic Positioning System and injection equipments onboard, flexible riser pipe whose end is connected with the wellhead on the sea floor, and pickup system at site.

91760526	6803	2020.829	Examining the Effectiveness of Climate Change Communication with Adolescents in Vietnam: The Role of Message Congruency	Climate change makes coastal communities more vulnerable to floods associated with storm surges and sea level rise, requiring both adaptation and mitigation measures. Moreover, proper understanding of flood risks and their potential impacts on climate change appears to be a communication challenge. In climate change communication, the effect of framing congruency on perception of risk, efficacy and behavioural intentions towards climate change adaptation and mitigation has received limited attention. Messages have not been congruent in framing risks associated with climate change. We define congruency as the coherent alignment of several aspects of message content. Messages are considered congruent when they provide recipients with consistent contents such as giving concrete and actionable advice, or by providing more abstract and general background information. This research focuses on climate change communication in fostering mitigation behaviours among adolescents in vulnerable locations in the global South. Based on Construal Level Theory, this paper investigates how message congruency affects the link between perceptions of climate change risk and efficacy and two predictors of behavioural change: perceived responsibility and mitigation intentions. We conducted an experiment to test the effect of congruent vs. incongruent risk communication among adolescents in highly vulnerable coastal communities in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam (N = 348). Multiple regression analysis found strong effects of congruency in message framing; when messages were congruent in the content, communicative interventions changed adolescents' perceptions and attitudes toward climate change mitigation more consistently. This research contributes both theoretically and practically to risk communication among adolescents and toward climate change mitigation behaviour.	climate change; risk communication; message framing; construal level; adolescents	2020	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760529	6400	2021.832	Assessing how ecosystem-based adaptations to climate change influence community wellbeing: a Vanuatu case study	Climate change poses significant threats to wellbeing and livelihoods of people and the ecosystems in many Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Adaptation solutions must counteract these threats while also supporting development in vulnerable SIDS. Suitable options need to ensure that connections between the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of socio-economic systems are defined in a way that can support how decisions are made (and by whom) and how these can impact on other parts of these systems. This is particularly important in many Pacific SIDS, where communities practise customary natural resource management and continue to rely on local natural resources. In this study, we model the anticipated impacts of climate change and the benefits of the ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approaches on community wellbeing in Vanuatu. To do this, we applied participatory and expert elicitation methods to develop a Bayesian network model, which was designed to evaluate community wellbeing responses at four explicit spatial scales. The model includes both acute and chronic impacts of climate change, the impact of coral bleaching, and the potential loss of Vanuatu's fringing coral reefs. The model predicts that all proposed EbA interventions will have a positive impact on wellbeing in all four locations to some degree, by either directly improving the integrity of Vanuatu's ecosystems or by protecting these ecosystems as a positive spill-over of related actions. Significantly, it also predicts that if climate change exceeds 1.5 degrees C of warming, the costs of achieving the same level of wellbeing are increased.	participatory bayesian networks; adaptation planning; small island developing states; adaptation cost and benefit	2021	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Summer visitation to this park depends strongly on favorable weather conditions. An intercept survey was used to collect data on visitor perceptions about the role of weather and possible climate change on tourism in general, and their destination selection specifically. A total of 506 visitors participated in the study. The majority of participants expressed that climate change will affect tourism. Weather conditions are important and influence visitors' destination selection. Statistically significant differences between age groups and gender about the effects of climate change on tourism were identified. By understanding the perceptions of the visitors, suitable adaptive strategies and early preparedness actions may be developed to cope with the impacts of climate change to the nature-based tourism industry in national parks. MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS Because nature-based tourism is highly-weather dependent, understanding visitor perceptions of destinations and their essential features will be crucial for sustainable tourism destination development. This qualitative study shows that the majority of visitors are concerned about climate change in a national park they visit, and would support agency efforts to mitigate possible climate change effects. Findings suggest public education and outreach to be relevant strategies for parks to enhance visitors' understanding of climate effects in the region and their role in reducing carbon-footprint. Management efforts, such as resource stewardship and mitigation strategies, should contemplate differences in perceptions of the effects of climate change and travel behavior according to visitor characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and market segments.

91760554	12519	2016.954	Adapting drinking-water systems to coastal climate change: evidence from Viet Nam and the Philippines	Coastal areas will increasingly experience adverse climate hazards such as coastal flooding and severe storms as a result of climate change. These hazards adversely affect drinking-water systems and thereby reduce access to safe drinking-water. Effective adaptation implementation minimizes the damaging impacts of these hazards. However, research on the enablers of and barriers to effective adaptation in low-income countries is lacking. This study maps enablers and barriers to climate change adaptation of water systems in coastal low-income countries using evidence from Viet Nam and the Philippines, countries which experience frequent extreme climate events. Interviews were carried out with staff from 29 water utilities and government agencies. A systematic framework for diagnosing barriers to climate change adaptation was used to analyze the responses. Five factors were identified as relevant to effective adaptation: partnerships; financial resources; human and technical resources; leadership and political will; and awareness of climate change. The factors identified were related to all the elements of the framework-actors, system of concern, and context-and were relevant to the three phases of the adaptation process (understanding the problem, planning the adaptation, and managing the implementation). Our findings can assist water system managers in diagnosing barriers to effective adaptation that may exist and identifying relevant partnerships and resources that will aid in overcoming these barriers.	drinking-water; adaptation; barriers; low-income	2016	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760566	13422	2021.1831	Using quantitative dynamic adaptive policy pathways to manage climate change-induced coastal erosion	Adaptation requires planning strategies that consider the combined effect of climatic and nonclimatic drivers, which are deeply uncertain. This uncertainty arises from many sources, cascades and accumulates in risk estimates. A prominent trend to incorporate this uncertainty in adaptation planning is through adaptive approaches such as the dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP). We present a quantitative DAPP application for coastal erosion management to increase its utilisation in this field. We adopt an approach in which adaptation objectives and actions have continuous quantitative metrics that evolve over time as conditions change. The approach hinges on an adaptation information system that comprises hazard and impact modelling and systematic monitoring to assess changing risks and adaptation signals in the light of adaptation pathway choices. Using an elaborated case study, we force a shoreline evolution model with waves and storm surges generated by means of stochastic modelling from 2010 to 2100, considering uncertainty in extreme weather events, climate variability and mean sea-level rise. We produce a new type of adaptation pathways map showing a set of 90-year probabilistic trajectories that link changing objectives (e.g., no adaptation, limit risk increase, avoid risk increase) and nourishment placement over time. This DAPP approach could be applied to other domains of climate change adaptation bringing a new perspective in adaptive planning under deep uncertainty.	coastal erosion; climate change adaptation; adaptation pathways; dynamic adaptive policy pathways; adaptation information system; uncertainty	2021	Laurent	Devi	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

However, current high installation, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning costs are hindering these offshore technologies to reach a commercialization stage. In this paper we focus on the use of divers and remotely-operated vehicles during the installation and monitoring phase of wave energy converters. Methods and results are based on the wave energy converter system developed by Uppsala University, and our experience in offshore deployments obtained during the past eleven years. The complexity of underwater operations, carried out by either divers or remotely-operated vehicles, is emphasized. Three methods for the deployment of wave energy converters are economically and technically analyzed and compared: one using divers alone, a fully-automated approach using remotely-operated vehicles, and an intermediate approach, involving both divers and underwater vehicles. The monitoring of wave energy converters by robots is also studied, both in terms of costs and technical challenges. The results show that choosing an autonomous deployment method is more advantageous than a diver-assisted method in terms of operational time, but that numerous factors prevent the wide application of robotized operations. Technical solutions are presented to enable the use of remotely-operated vehicles instead of divers in ocean renewable technology operations. Economically, it is more efficient to use divers than autonomous vehicles for the deployment of six or fewer wave energy converters. From seven devices, remotely-operated vehicles become advantageous.	wave energy; diving; rov; operation and maintenance; wave energy converter; deployment	2018	Laurent	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760572	1	2016.1	Rising tides: adaptation policy alternatives for coastal residential buildings in Australia	In this work, a risk-based assessment method and benefit-cost analysis to support policy decisions for adapting Australian coastal residential buildings to future coastal inundation hazard is presented. Future coastal inundation is mainly influenced by storm surge and rising sea level. The sea level rises projected by the A1FI, A1B and B1 emissions scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are considered. The effects of economic and population growth are accounted for by three urban development scenarios: (a) business as usual, (b) urban consolidation and (c) regional development. The adaptation policy actions investigated include a `protect' stance (involving the construction of seawalls), an `accommodate' stance that mandates raising house floors to a certain height (e.g. at heights of 100-year events) and an `avoid' stance that limits new developments in hazardous areas. Policy stances classified as reactive (i.e. action taken after damage being incurred) and anticipatory (i.e. action taken anticipating what will happen) are developed for asset investment choices. In general, adaptation costs are an order of magnitude lower than benefits gained from avoided damages. The results highlight that adaptation action for coastal inundation has a no-regrets character and provides a strong case for reform to ensure that Australia-wide adaptation opportunities are realised.	climate change; climate adaptation; storm surge; astronomical tide; vulnerability	2016	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760579	7284	2018.763	Policies and mechanisms to address climate-induced migration and displacement in Pacific and Caribbean small island developing states	Purpose - This study aims to assess policies and mechanisms in Caribbean and Pacific small island developing states (SIDS) that address climate-induced migration and displacement. The migration of communities away from vulnerable regions is highly likely to be an adaptation strategy used in low-elevation SIDS, as the impacts of climate change are likely to result in significant loss and damage, threatening their very territorial existence. SIDS must ensure that residents relocate to less vulnerable locations and may need to consider international movement of residents. Ad hoc approaches to migration and displacement may result in increased vulnerability of residents, making the development and enforcement of comprehensive national policies that address these issues a necessity. Design/methodology/approach - Interviews with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiators for SIDS as well as analysis of secondary data, including Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, are utilized to determine policies and mechanisms in place that focus on climate-induced migration and displacement. Findings - While climate change is acknowledged as an existential threat, few SIDS have policies or mechanisms in place to guide climate-induced migration and displacement. Potential exists for migration and displacement to be included in policies that integrate disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation along with national sustainable development plans. Regional bodies are beneficial to providing guidance to SIDS in the development of nationally appropriate frameworks to address climate-induced migration and displacement. Originality/value - Existing gaps in policies and mechanisms and challenges faced by SIDS in developing strategies to address climate-induced migration and displacement are explored. Best practices and recommendations for strategies for SIDS to address migration and displacement are provided.	small island developing states; climate-induced migration; loss and damage	2018	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91760588	297194	2021.5692	A multi-objective optimisation model to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and costs in offshore natural gas upstream chains	The urgency of climate change, while the world economy is projected to depend on fossil fuels for some time, requires substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the oil and gas industry. This study proposes a methodology for the decarbonisation of offshore natural gas production networks through progressive electrification, either by connecting offshore platforms with nearby renewable energy sources, e.g. offshore wind farms, or by sharing resources so as to improve their energy generation efficiency. In this context, a novel multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to simultaneously minimise greenhouse gas emissions and associated costs from a determined offshore platform network, considering technical constraints, such as maintaining the energy balance of the network, ensuring that cables are installed to enable energy flows, and respecting the maximum generation capacities and minimum operating loads of turbines. For demonstration purposes, the proposed methodology was applied to a UK Southern North Sea network and optimised using the augmented Îµ-constraint method. The Pareto front approximation obtained suggests that the studied network's cumulative greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by 25% over the next 10 years at an average cost of US$370.9 per tonne CO2e. This study also explores the impact that uncertainties and postponing investment decisions may have in the set context.

91760589	35304	2010.1194	Kuroshio power plant development plan	As a country lacking energy reserves. Taiwan imports 99.2\% of its energy, with only a small portion of indigenous energy, such as hydro, wind, and solar. In 2008, each Taiwanese spent 85,000 NTD dollars (1 USD similar to 32 NTD) to purchase oil, coal, gas, and nuclear fuel from foreign countries, accounting for a total payment of 1.8 trillion NTD, more than the annual budget of the Taiwan government of 1.7 trillion NTD. In the same year, Taiwan emitted about 1\% of the world's greenhouse gas (GHG), or 12 tons per person-year, ranking 18th globally. These situations in terms of energy security and carbon emission are very severe. To resolve these severe situations, harnessing the power of the Kuroshio in eastern Taiwan offers a great opportunity. The Kuroshio is a branch of the North Pacific Ocean current. Due to the westward-enhanced effect, this ocean current is strong and stable as it passes through eastern Taiwan. The flow rate is about 30 sverdrup (Sv) or 1000 times that of the Yangtze River, the average speed is 1 m/s, the flow direction is fixed to the north, and the flow path is close to the east coast of Taiwan. By precisely locating high-quality sites and implementing sequential works with careful planning, one can possibly generate exploitable power more than 30 GW. With 30 GW of clean energy, Taiwan could effectively enhance energy security, reduce GHG emission, and lower energy-purchasing cost. This paper proposes a feasibility study to explore the power of the Kuroshio. The content consists of four parts: (1) assessment of Kuroshio power reserves, (2) development of turbine generators, (3) development of turbine-anchor system, and (4) deep-sea marine engineering of turbine clusters. By integrating these technologies above, we propose a project to construct a 30 MW pilot plant. In this project, we also discuss the financial analysis and propose new regulations, environmental impact analysis, risk assessment, and other relevant issues. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

91760599	5169	2022.747	Stakeholders' Perceptions of Nature-Based Solutions for Hurricane Risk Reduction Policies in the Mexican Caribbean	Nature-based solutions (NbSs) have long recognized the value of coastal and marine ecosystem management and associated ecosystem services as useful tools for climate change mitigation (e.g., blue carbon) and adaptation (e.g., coastal protection against flooding and storm surges). However, NbSs remain poorly acknowledged and mostly absent from coastal planning for disaster risk reduction policies in the Caribbean, as well as from ex-post disaster reconstruction funds. With the increasing frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the region, NbSs are now more needed than ever. Taking Mexico as a representative case study for the wider Caribbean, we here seek to identify and analyze the barriers and opportunities perceived by relevant stakeholders for mainstreaming coastal-marine NbSs into coastal management and disaster risk reduction policies (e.g., mangroves as green infrastructure) to protect coastal societies and national economies against hurricanes. We conduct semi-structured, in-depth interviews with twenty stakeholders covering academic, governmental, tourism, NGO, coastal planning, and financial domains. Among the twenty-three identified barriers, governance, institutional, financial, and human-capacity aspects are the most dominant perceptions behind the current lack of NbS implementation. Future action for the policy integration of NbSs requires widespread political will and better quantification of both the provision of ecosystem services and their economic benefits under conventional markets.	nature-based solutions; green infrastructure; mangroves; reefs; hurricanes; disaster risk reduction; coastal management; caribbean; policies	2022	Laurent	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760601	2040	2020.264	Evaluating Resilience Co-benefits of Engineering With Nature (R) Projects	An increasing abundance of projects demonstrate that coastal management strategies that align engineering and ecological objectives can deliver a wide range benefits. Better understanding how these strategies fare under stress is crucially important, including in comparison to more conventional coastal engineering approaches, in order to inform where they might be a viable alternative or complement to conventional coastal storm risk management. In particular, the prospect that these strategies may be able to recover from disturbances and adapt to better survive future disturbances with minimal or no intervention is compelling. However, no formal accounting method exists to assess how ecosystem-based approaches contribute to the resilience of coastal systems, that is, their ability to prepare, absorb, recover, and adapt from stressors. An assessment rubric is developed and demonstrated for Engineering With Nature (R) projects and limitations and ways forward are discussed.	resilience; co-benefits; coastal management; natural infrastructure; risk	2020	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

To study attitudes and perceptions towards environmental measures, we apply several items of New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) and Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theories to cross-examine the public perceptions of climate change in the urban city-state of Singapore through analysis of quantitative questionnaires and qualitative semi-structured interviews. The perceptions were explored about ecological orientation (two dimensions of NEP: level of concern, self-reported knowledge) and environmental behavior (two dimensions of VBN: acceptance and support of national adaptation measures, confidence in adaptation). There is a moderate to high concern for climate change, in general, and sea level rise and flooding, in particular, and the concern is expected to increase in the future. Individuals who indicated a higher level of concern are likely to be more accepting and supportive of climate change measures. Also, while the majority of the populace are amenable to legislative measures from the government, such as enacting pro-environmental laws and more are agreeable to accepting cuts on living standards, as opposed to paying more in prices and taxes. Ecological orientation does not translate directly into environmental behavior, highlighting the gulf between perception and behavior in Singapore.	climate change adaptation; public perceptions; public policy; new ecological paradigm; value-belief-norm theory	2020	Laurent	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760635	269714	2014.949	An experimental study on the CO2-CH4 swap process between gaseous CO2 and CH4 hydrate in porous media	Recently, exhaustion of primary energy sources and increase in the atmospheric CO2 levels have become two major energy challenges of the world; therefore, utilization of alternative energy sources and avoiding the emission of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere are some of the serious problems of this century that should be addressed immediately. Many alternatives are being assessed to solve or at least to cease the negative effects of these issues.Vast amount of methane in the form of gas hydrates is stored in several deep marine sediments and in permafrost region. Therefore, production of methane from hydrates may postpone the former problem for significant period of time. Although several production mechanisms like depressurization, thermal treatment and inhibitor injection have been proposed, recovery of methane from hydrate bearing sediments is still an issue of debate. Also, it is widely believed that CO2 emissions due to fossil fuel combustion and transportation are mainly responsible for the increase in the global temperature level. Therefore, several options are being evaluated to diminish the anthropogenic CO2 emissions like storing the captured CO2 in another domain of the planet for example, the geosphere. At this point, the injection of CO2 into CH4 hydrate bearing sediments deserves particular attention as this technique may enable integration of CO2 storage with production from CH4 hydrates.In this study, gaseous CO2 was injected into the unconsolidated sand pack system which includes 30% methane hydrate saturation at free CH4 excess conditions. After the CO2 injection, cyclic behaviors at the pressure gauges were observed for approximately 6h that may indicate CH4-CO2 swap within hydrate cages. It was thought that the cyclic behaviors in the pressure gauges indicate CO2-CH4 swap within the hydrate cages. Upward and downward trends in cycles results from the gaseous CH4 that was leaving the cages and gaseous CO2 that was stabilizing the cages respectively. Swap process was confirmed by estimating the gas compositions at the instant of CO2 injection and by measuring via gas chromatography analyses after the swap process. As a result of the swap process, it was estimated that 86.3% of the CO2 filled the hydrate cages. After stabilization, system was left to dissociate for several days and samples taken from the cell at different time intervals were analyzed via gas chromatography in order to gain an insight on hydrate distribution in porous media after the swap process. Analyses showed that, amount of free CO2 in the cell were increasing gradually reached a peak value and then decreased. This suggests that, CH4-CO2 swap process mostly took place at the surface of the system as the injected CO2 initially accumulated at the external part of the unconsolidated sand pack system and the area where the reaction took place was maximum. The results obtained from this research proposed that the injection of gaseous CO2 causes dissociation of methane hydrate also samples that were taken during the dissociation process may give some insight about the probable hydrate distribution at the system.

91760640	253691	2019.3753	The Sources of Organic Matter in Seagrass Sediments and Their Contribution to Carbon Stocks in the Spermonde Islands, Indonesia	Seagrass ecosystems have a potential role in climate change mitigation due to their ability to store high amount of carbon, particularly in the sediment. Studying the factors and mechanisms responsible for this storing capacity is essential to understand seagrass carbon sink function. Therefore, in this study, we identified the sources of organic carbon (Corg) in seagrass sediments and the implication to Corg stocks from four islands in the Spermonde Islands that located at different zones. We used the Bayesian stable isotope mixing modelÂ to estimate the proportional contribution of different sources to sediment carbon. Seagrass meadows that located in adjacent to high anthropogenic activities (deforestation and aquacultures) with direct exposure to wave actions, such as on the Bauluang Island, accumulated organic carbon that derived from multiple sources, where phytoplankton contributed the highest, while on the other three islands that are relatively protected from wave actions, the highest contribution (~ 75%) was from autochthonous production (seagrass-derived). Sediment Corg stocks vary spatially, ranging from 11.9 to 32.1Â Mg C haâˆ’1 (based on the obtained depth of 20â€“55Â cm), or 40.5 to 83.5Â Mg C haâˆ’1 if extrapolated to 1Â m depth. The variability of sediment properties and Corg stocks in this study is not solely determined by the geographical differences (inshore, nearshore and offshore islands), but also influenced by other local factors such as hydrodynamics that control the distribution of carbon sources, anthropogenic pressures and species composition. These factors should be taken into account when developing coastal management strategies, as efforts are being undertaken to include coastal ecosystems (including seagrass ecosystems) on the National Green House Gasses Reduction Strategy.

The important synergistic impacts coexisting with freshwater scarcity are increasing urbanization rates, subsiding soils, saltwater intrusion in aquifers and rivers, coastal erosion, and increased flooding. Innovative design strategies and concepts for the integration of decentralized rainwater management measures can contribute to the integrated and climate resilient planning of urban spaces that are threatened by climate change scenarios that worsen the security of urban infrastructures and the future availability of fresh water. Decentralized rainwater management, including retention, storage, and reuse strategies that are integrated into spatial planning and urban design, can reduce flood risks while simultaneously enhancing freshwater availability. This paper discusses a paradigm shift in urban water management, from centralized to decentralized management (that is, from threats to opportunities), using the example of two case studies. Concepts and strategies for building climate resilient cities, which address flood control, the protection of freshwater resources, and the harmonization of a natural and more sustainable water balance, are presented for Almere (Rhine Schelde Delta, The Netherlands) and Hsingchu (Dotzpu Delta, Taiwan).

One such region is the U.S. West Coast, where HABs of toxigenic species of Pseudo-nitzschia have been found to coincide with or closely follow periods of warming. In 2015, the region experienced a massive HAB of Pseudo-nitzschia that was associated with the 2014-16 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave. The HAB event delayed the opening of the lucrative commercial Dungeness crab fishery for up to 5 months and closed the popular recreational razor clam fishery, resulting in fishery failures and disaster declarations and causing significant sociocultural and economic impacts to coastal communities. Here, management actions are examined that were taken by federal and state government agencies and responses of coastal residents to this extreme HAB event using a disaster risk management framework consisting of four phases: 1) prediction and early warning, 2) event response, 3) recovery and reconstruction, and 4) mitigation and prevention. Clear differences in management actions at the state level were evident in California, Oregon, and Washington during every phase, producing vastly different perceptions of management by coastal residents. A history of trusted relationships and coordination among agencies and with the fishing industry in Washington State was associated with more transparent and accepted management responses. The examination found that additional education, outreach, and trust-building exercises would provide benefits to communities affected by extreme HAB events. Our findings contribute to an understanding of climate change adaptation in coastal communities dependent on fishery resources.	harmful algal bloom; domoic acid; governance; disaster risk management; perceptions; climate change; adaptation	2020	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

These are the people whose entire landscape is typically no higher than one meter above sea level. Extreme environmental changes are nothing new to these communities. Over many generations these atoll cultures have survived major, unpredictable and locally devastating changes that are of the same magnitude as those expected from climate changes. An examination of traditional ecological knowledge of Marshall Islanders at Rongelap atoll serves to illustrate some of the coping strategies that have enabled these people to be resilient in the past and in the current environmental crisis. Interviews revealed that these atoll dwellers actively manage the resources that are most likely to be impacted by climate change.

Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC's) Paris Agreement-which aims to limit climate change and increase global resilience to its effects-was a breakthrough in climate diplomacy, committing its Parties to develop and update national climate plans. Yet the Parties to the Agreement have largely overlooked the effect of climate change on ocean-based communities, economies, and ecosystems-as well as the role that the ocean can play in mitigating and adapting to climate change. Because the ocean is an integral part of the climate system, stronger inclusion of ocean issues is critical to achieving the Agreement's goals. Here we discuss four ocean-climate linkages that suggest specific responses by Parties to the Agreement connected to 1) accelerating climate ambition, including via sustainable ocean-based mitigation strategies; 2) focusing on CO2 emissions to address ocean acidification; 3) better understanding ocean-based mitigation; and 4) pursuing ocean-based adaptation. These linkages offer a more complete perspective on the reasons strong climate action is necessary and inform a systematic approach for addressing ocean issues under the Agreement to strengthen climate mitigation and adaptation.	ocean climate change; ocean acidification; united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc); sustainable development goals (sdgs); nationally determined contributions (ndcs); intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc)	2019	Laurent	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91760696	235558	2015.5489	Harnessing urban coastal infrastructure for ecological enhancement	Owing to a combination of increase in coastal population and processes related to global climate change, intense coastal development is inevitable. Shallow-water habitats are prone to be replaced by structures such as seawalls and breakwaters. While adding ample hard substrate to the seascape, these structures are not surrogates to natural habitats, and are often associated with nuisance and invasive species. These differences are attributed to design features including high inclination, low complexity and high homogeneity - all atypical of natural habitats. To date, coastal infrastructure has been designed with limited consideration to marine life developing on it. Consequently, its ability to provide ecosystem services similar to those offered by natural habitats has been severely compromised. This paper presents two case studies implementing ecological enhancement at the Brooklyn Bride Park waterfront. Both strategies are examples for restoring viable ecosystem services while also serving structural and societal goals. The first is an example of structural repairs of aging pier piles, by applying innovative technology of ecological concrete encasement which creates valuable habitat. The second is an example of boosting the ecological performance of a constructed riprap waterfront, by integrating precast tide-pools that add water-retaining habitat features lacking from standard coastal infrastructure.	coastal engineering; conservation; design methods \& aids	2015	Laurent	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91805341	5488	2021.735	Extending the natural adaptive capacity of coral holobionts	Anthropogenic climate change and environmental degradation destroy coral reefs, the ecosystem services they provide, and the livelihoods of close to a billion people who depend on these services. Restoration approaches to increase the resilience of corals are therefore necessary to counter environmental pressures relevant to climate change projections. In this Review, we examine the natural processes that can increase the adaptive capacity of coral holobionts, with the aim of preserving ecosystem functioning under future ocean conditions. Current approaches that centre around restoring reef cover can be integrated with emerging approaches to enhance coral stress resilience and, thereby, allow reefs to regrow under a new set of environmental conditions. Emerging approaches such as standardized acute thermal stress assays, selective sexual propagation, coral probiotics, and environmental hardening could be feasible and scalable in the real world. However, they must follow decision-making criteria that consider the different reef, environmental, and ecological conditions. The implementation of adaptive interventions tailored around nature-based solutions will require standardized frameworks, appropriate ecological risk-benefit assessments, and analytical routines for consistent and effective utilization and global coordination. Anthropogenic climate change and environmental deterioration are driving global degradation of coral reefs. This Review examines how the natural adaptive capacity of coral holobionts can be harnessed and expanded to counter the ongoing loss of coral reefs.

With the aim of enhancing coral bleaching tolerance, we evolved 10 clonal strains of a common coral microalgal endosymbiont at elevated temperatures (31 degrees C) for 4 years in the laboratory. All 10 heat-evolved strains had expanded their thermal tolerance in vitro following laboratory evolution. After reintroduction into coral host larvae, 3 of the 10 heat-evolved endo-symbionts also increased the holobionts' bleaching tolerance. Although lower levels of secreted reactive oxygen species (ROS) accompanied thermal tolerance of the heat-evolved algae, reduced ROS secretion alone did not predict thermal tolerance in symbiosis. The more tolerant symbiosis exhibited additional higher constitutive expression of algal carbon fixation genes and coral heat tolerance genes. These findings demonstrate that coral stock with enhanced climate resilience can be developed through ex hospite laboratory evolution of their microalgal endosymbionts.

91805343	37893	2021.3891	Current trends and prospects of tidal energy technology	Generation of energy across the world is today reliant majorly on fossil fuels. The burning of these fuels is growing in line with the increase in the demand for energy globally. Consequently, climate change, air contamination, and energy security issues are rising as well. An efficient alternative to this grave hazard is the speedy substitution of fossil fuel-based carbon energy sources with the shift to clean sources of renewable energy that cause zero emissions. This needs to happen in conjunction with the continuing increase in the overall consumption of energy worldwide. Many resources of renewable energy are available. These include thermal, solar photovoltaic, biomass and wind, tidal energy, hydropower, and geothermal. Notably, tidal energy exhibits great potential with regard to its dependability, superior energy density, certainty, and durability. The energy mined from the tides on the basis of steady and anticipated vertical movements of the water, causing tidal currents, could be converted into kinetic energy to produce electricity. Tidal barrages could channel mechanical energy, while tidewater river turbines can seize the energy from tidal currents. This study discusses the present trends, ecological effects, and the prospects for technology related to tidal energy.	tidal energy; current trends; prospects; environmental impact	2021	AC	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91805344	1952	2020.255	Genome-wide SNP analysis reveals an increase in adaptive genetic variation through selective breeding of coral	Marine heat waves are increasing in magnitude, duration, and frequency as a result of climate change and are the principal global driver of mortality in reef-building corals. Resilience-based genetic management may increase coral heat tolerance, but it is unclear how temperature responses are regulated at the genome level and thus how corals may adapt to warming naturally or through selective breeding. Here we combine phenotypic, pedigree, and genomic marker data from colonies sourced from a warm reef on the Great Barrier Reef reproductively crossed with conspecific colonies from a cooler reef to produce combinations of warm purebreds and warm-cool hybrid larvae and juveniles. Interpopulation breeding created significantly greater genetic diversity across the coral genome compared to breeding between populations and maintained diversity in key regions associated with heat tolerance and fitness. High-density genome-wide scans of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified alleles significantly associated with larval families reared at 27.5 degrees C (87-2,224 loci), including loci putatively associated with proteins involved in responses to heat stress (cell membrane formation, metabolism, and immune responses). Underlying genetics of these families explained 43\% of PCoA multilocus variation in survival, growth, and bleaching responses at 27.5 degrees C and 31 degrees C at the juvenile stage. Genetic marker contribution to total variation in fitness traits (narrow-sense heritability) was high for survival but not for growth and bleaching in juveniles, with heritability of these traits being higher at 31 degrees C relative to 27.5 degrees C. While based on only a limited number of crosses, the mechanistic understanding presented here demonstrates that allele frequencies are affected by one generation of selective breeding, key information for the assessments of genetic intervention feasibility and modelling of reef futures.	bleaching; coral; heat tolerance; heritability; selective breeding; snps	2020	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91805345	226823	2021.19130	A review of tidal energy-Resource, feedbacks, and environmental interactions	The ocean contains a variety of renewable energy resources, little of which has been exploited. Here, we review both tidal range and tidal stream energy, with a focus on the resource, feedbacks, and environmental interactions. The review covers a wide range of timescales of relevance to tidal energy, from fortnightly (spring-neap) and semi-diurnal variability, down to array, and device-scale turbulence. When simulating the regional tidal energy resource, and to assess environmental impacts, it is necessary to account for feedbacks between the tidal array and the resource itself. We critically review various methods for simulating energy extraction, from insights gained through theoretical studies of ``tidal fences{''} in idealized channels, to realistic three-dimensional model studies with complex geometry and arrays of turbines represented by momentum sinks and additional turbulence due to the presence of rotors and support structures. We discuss how variability can be reduced by developing multiple (aggregated) sites with a consideration of the enhanced phase diversity offered by exploiting less energetic tidal currents. This leads to future research questions that have not yet been explored in depth at first-generation tidal sites in relatively sheltered channels (e.g., the interaction of waves with currents). Such enhanced understanding of real sea conditions, including the effects of wind and waves, leads to our other identified primary future research direction-reduced uncertainties in turbulence predictions, including the development of realistic models that simulate the interaction between ambient turbulence and the turbulence resulting from multiple wakes, and changes to system-wide hydrodynamics, water quality, and sedimentation.\& nbsp;(C) 2021 Author(s).

91805346	332	2022.53	Internal relocation as a relevant and feasible adaptation strategy in Rangiroa Atoll, French Polynesia	Atoll islands face increasing coastal risks (coastal erosion and marine flooding) due to climate change, especially sea-level rise. To face increasing coastal risks, various adaptation options are considered by atoll countries and territories, including in particular hard protection (preferred option to date), Nature-based Solutions (increasingly used) and island raising (considered a longer-term solution and a potential alternative to international migration, e.g. in the Maldives). Internal relocation within the same atoll island or atoll, which refers to long-term community movement from one threatened island area or island to a safer island area or island, has previously been disregarded by scholars as a potentially relevant climate adaptation strategy. However, in low-lying coastal areas, it offers real potential to address the dual context of increasing climate risks and the shrinking of the solution space. This paper assesses the potential of internal relocation for atolls by applying to Rangiroa Atoll, French Polynesia, Central Pacific, a two-fold assessment framework questioning its physical relevance (are some islands high enough to host settlements in the future?) and its societal feasibility (are the political-institutional and socio-economic conditions in place?

The findings show that internal relocation is both relevant and feasible on Rangiroa Atoll and should therefore serve as a pillar to develop robust in situ adaptation pathways in this atoll.

We aimed to quantify the magnitude and consistency of climate driven community shifts inside and outside Marine Protected Areas before and after a marine heatwave using a kelp forest fish community dataset in southern California, USA. Abundance, biomass, diversity and recruitment of warm-water affinity species during the marine heatwave were significantly greater compared with prior years yet cool-water affinity species did not show commensurate declines. Fish communities inside MPAs were not buffered from these community shifts. This result is likely because the particular species most responsible for the community response to environmental drivers, were not fisheries targets. Resource managers working to preserve biodiversity in a changing climate will need to consider additional management tools and strategies in combination with protected areas to mitigate the effect of warming on marine communities.

91805348	245887	2020.9969	Taking control of human-induced destabilisation of atoll islands: lessons learnt from the Tuamotu Archipelago, French Polynesia	Based on the study of nine atolls of the Tuamotu Archipelago, French Polynesia, this article assesses the anthropogenic disturbances that disrupt atoll island natural dynamics and thereby undermine the ability of these islands to naturally adjust to climate-related pressures. It more specifically investigates to what extent the existing legal framework limits these disturbances. The results show that 20 types of human disturbances occurring in the intertidal, coastal and inland areas contribute to island destabilisation. Land reclamation, sediment extraction from coastal and intertidal areas, coastal developments and engineered protection structures are the main disturbances observed. These disturbances are increasingly occurring on both urban and rural islands. We found that law has failed in regulating these disturbances for various reasons, related to both the content of law (including legal gaps and the lack of atoll-specific legal provisions) and the failure of its implementation, which reflects governance issues. In this context, taking control of human disturbances requires not only strengthening and updating existing legal tools, but also and most importantly creating the enabling conditions for law to be effective, especially through the strengthening of institutions' capacities and public involvement. Additionally, promoting alternatives to locally carried out sediment mining and encouraging the construction of raised houses would help taking control of human-induced island destabilisation.	atolls; law; human disturbances; climate change; coastal risks; pacific ocean	2020	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91805350	36868	2022.3932	Operationalizing marketable blue carbon	The global carbon sequestration and avoided emissions potentially achieved via blue carbon is high (-3\% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions); however, it is limited by multidisciplinary and interacting uncertainties spanning the social, governance, financial, and technological dimensions. We compiled a transdisciplinary team of experts to elucidate these challenges and identify a way forward. Key actions to enhance blue carbon as a natural climate solution include improving policy and legal arrangements to ensure equitable sharing of benefits; improving stewardship by incorporating indigenous knowledge and values; clarifying property rights; improving financial approaches and accounting tools to incorporate co-benefits; developing technological solutions for measuring blue carbon sequestration at low cost; and resolving knowledge gaps regarding blue carbon cycles. Implementing these actions and operationalizing blue carbon will achieve measurable changes to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, provide multiple co-benefits, and address national obligations associated with international agreements.

91805351	13911	2020.1726	Responding to Climate Change: Participatory Evaluation of Adaptation Options for Key Marine Fisheries in Australia's South East	Planned adaptation to climate impacts and subsequent vulnerabilities will necessarily interact with autonomous responses enabled within existing fisheries management processes and initiated by the harvest and post-harvest components of fishing industries. Optimal adaptation options are those which enable negative effects to be mitigated and opportunities that arise to be maximized, both in relation to specific climate-driven changes and the broader fisheries system. We developed a two-step participatory approach to evaluating adaption options for key fisheries in the fast-warming hotspot of south-eastern Australia. Four fisheries (southern rock lobster, abalone, snapper, and blue grenadier) were selected as case studies on the basis of their high to moderate vulnerability to climatic effects on species distribution and abundance. Involved stakeholders undertook a ``first pass{''} screening assessment of options, by characterizing and then evaluating options. In the characterization step potential adaptation options for each fishery, contextualized by prior knowledge of each species' climate change exposure and sensitivity, were described using a characterization matrix. This matrix included: the specific climate vulnerability/challenges, the implications of each option on the fishery system as a whole, the temporal and spatial scales of implementation processes, and realized benefits and costs. In the evaluation step, semi-quantitative evaluation of options was undertaken by stakeholders scoring the anticipated performance of an option against a pre-determined set of criteria relating to perceived feasibility, risk (inclusive of potential costs), and benefit. Reduction of the total annual commercial catch as well as reductions in both effort and catch through spatial and temporal closures were the options scored as having the highest level of expected benefit and of feasibility and the lowest level of risk of negative outcomes overall. Our screening assessment represents a pragmatic approach to evaluate and compare support for and the effects of alternative adaptation options prior to committing to more detailed formal and resource intensive evaluation or implementation.	adaptation options; climate change; commercial fisheries; evaluation; participation	2020	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
91805352	25558	2020.2647	Substantial blue carbon in overlooked Australian kelp forests	Recognition of the potential for vegetated coastal ecosystems to store and sequester carbon has led to their increasing inclusion into global carbon budgets and carbon offset schemes. However, kelp forests have been overlooked in evaluations of this `blue carbon', which have been limited to tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass beds. We determined the continental-scale contribution to blue carbon from kelp forests in Australia using areal extent, biomass, and productivity measures from across the entire Great Southern Reef. We reveal that these kelp forests represent 10.3-22.7 Tg C and contribute 1.3-2.8 Tg C year(-1) in sequestered production, amounting to more than 30\% of total blue carbon stored and sequestered around the Australian continent, and similar to 3\% of the total global blue carbon. We conclude that the omission of kelp forests from blue carbon assessments significantly underestimates the carbon storage and sequestration potential from vegetated coastal ecosystems globally.

91805353	298405	2021.4737	Eco-efficiency assessment of wave energy conversion in Western Australia	Western Australia is an ideal location for wave energy conversion with some of the highest energy density waves in the world. Renewable energy technologies have had an emerging presence in Australia, seen as a vehicle to decarbonise energy generation and provide a sustainable future. This paper examines the environmental and economic feasibility of energy generation from wave energy conversion in Western Australia by undertaking an Eco-Efficiency Analysis (EEA). The environmental impacts of wave energy converters (WEC) were assessed by application of a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) while the economic performance considered the Life Cycle Costing (LCC). An eco-efficiency portfolio was developed to visualise the sustainability of coastal energy generation options â€“ wave generation, offshore wind and diesel generation â€“ finding that wave generation was the most eco-efficient option and could be deemed a sustainable energy generation technology. The LCA results were comparable to literature, validating the impact assessment. The proposed wave device was estimated to produce a global warming potential of 27.3 kg CO2 eq/MWh and have a levelised cost of energy at 134 $AUD/MWh. The environmental impact of the device was significantly lower than alternative coastal energy generation methods in Western Australia while the associated cost of energy remained competitive. This favourable assessment using the eco-efficiency framework confirmed that the application of WEC in Western Australia would be an eco-efficient option and that research should be undertaken to develop this technology as a key player in the transition to a sustainable energy industry.

91805354	12272	2020.1527	Symbiodiniaceae probiotics for use in bleaching recovery	Coral reefs are currently under threat as a consequence of local and global stressors, in particular, mass coral bleaching induced by climate warming. In conjunction with global cuts to carbon emissions, active restoration interventions are being investigated as an additional option to buy time while these stressors are mitigated. One intervention with the potential to improve recovery during or postbleaching involves the addition of probiotic treatments, that is the addition of microorganisms that provide benefits to the host. Fragments of the branching coral, Acropora millepora, were experimentally exposed to a bleaching event coupled with the inoculation of Symbiodiniaceae probiotics (Durusdinium trenchii and Cladocopium goreaui) to determine if these probiotic treatments could ameliorate bleaching related stress and mortality. Fragments inoculated with C. goreaui and exposed to 32 degrees C for 6 days exhibited significantly less mortality (9.1 +/- 5\%) compared to corals exposed to 32 degrees C without probiotics (66.7 +/- 8\%) or with D. trenchii (41.7 +/- 9\%). Fragments in the C. goreaui probiotic treatment also bleached less and exhibited the highest photosynthetic efficiency compared to fragments inoculated with the D. trenchii at 32 degrees C. Internal transcribed spacer-2 amplicon sequencing did not detect the inoculated D. trenchii and C. goreaui cells within A. millepora tissues at the end of the experiment, suggesting the corals did not reestablish symbiosis but instead used inoculated cells as a nutritional supplement, although other factors such as shuffling conditions may have had an effect. This study highlights that nutritional supplementation can possibly aid coral resilience to temperature stress, though a far more detailed understanding of the factors that influence host regulation during symbiosis establishment is required.	bleaching; heat stress; probiotics; symbiodiniaceae; symbiosis	2020	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91805355	157	2022.26	Climate change adaptation in fisheries	We conducted a global systematic literature review of climate change adaptation in fisheries. We addressed three specific questions: (i) What are fisheries adapting to? (ii) How are fisheries adapting? and (iii) What research gaps need to be addressed? We identified, characterized and examined case studies published between 1990 and 2019 that lie at the intersection of the domains of climate change, adaptation and fisheries. We characterized the documented climate change effects in fisheries that are being adapted to multiple stressors, general climate impacts, extreme events, ocean conditions, marine system shifts, climate variability, fishery dynamics, species distribution and atmospheric warming. Three categories of adaptive responses came to light: coping mechanisms (e.g. changing fishing location, use of traditional knowledge); adaptive strategies (e.g. livelihood diversification, incorporation of technology); and management responses (e.g. adaptive management, adaptation planning). We identified key potential areas for future research, including studies on the limits and barriers for adaptation, studies using specific conceptual and methodological approaches, and studies focussing on the top-producing countries such as China, Indonesia, Peru and Russia. This analysis gives broader insights to the fisheries industry and to climate change adaptation research to proceed in the face of new global challenges.	adaptation limits; adaptation tracking; global assessment; management approaches; research directions; systematic literature review	2022	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
91805356	12134	2022.1672	Assessing the coastal protection services of natural mangrove forests and artificial rock revetments	Coastal flooding and erosion cause significant social and economic impacts, globally. There is a growing interest in using natural habitats such as mangroves to defend coastlines. The protective services of mangroves, however, have not been assessed in the same rigorous engineering and socio-economic terms as rock revetments, and therefore are often overlooked by coastal managers. We used field measurements, a social science survey and economic valuation to compare the coastal protection services of mangroves and rock revetments, at five locations across Victoria, Australia. The results showed, in sheltered locations, both mangroves and rock revetments attenuated waves, however, the wave attenuation (per metre) of rock revetments was greater than mangroves, at two of the five locations. Only a small proportion of the survey respondents had observed flooding or erosion in their suburb but most agreed that mangroves provide important coastal protection benefits. Coastal landowners visited areas with mangroves more often than the public but were less likely to worry about the links between climate change and coastal erosion and flooding, or to agree that the coast was well protected with existing artificial coastal infrastructure, than other respondents. There were much higher up-front costs associated with building rock revetments, than planting mangroves, but rock revetments required less land than mangroves. Mangroves covered a larger area and averted more damages than rock revetments. Coastal managers and policy makers will have more success in advocating for nature-based solutions for coastal protection, if they are implemented in locations where they are eco-engineering and socio-economically acceptable options for climate change adaptation.	avicennia marina; coastal infrastructure; coastal protection; eco-engineering; social science; economic valuation	2022	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91805357	267291	2022.2986	Ocean conservation boosts climate change mitigation and adaptation	Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being promoted as an ocean-based climate solution. However, such claims remain controversial because of the diffuse and poorly synthesized literature on climate benefits of MPAs. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of 22,403 publications spanning 241 MPAs and analyzed these across 16 ecological and social pathways through which MPAs could contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that marine conservation can significantly enhance carbon sequestration, coastal protection, biodiversity, and the reproductive capacity of marine organisms as well as fishersâ€™ catch and income. Most of these benefits are only achieved in fully or highly protected areas and increase with MPA age. Although MPAs alone cannot offset all climate change impacts, they are a useful tool for climate change mitigation and adaptation of social-ecological systems.

91805358	296342	2021.3810	Testing the climate intervention potential of ocean afforestation using the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt	Ensuring that global warming remains &lt;2 Â°C requires rapid CO2 emissions reduction. Additionally, 100â€“900 gigatons CO2 must be removed from the atmosphere by 2100 using a portfolio of CO2 removal (CDR) methods. Ocean afforestation, CDR through basin-scale seaweed farming in the open ocean, is seen as a key component of the marine portfolio. Here, we analyse the CDR potential of recent re-occurring trans-basin belts of the floating seaweed Sargassum in the (sub)tropical North Atlantic as a natural analogue for ocean afforestation. We show that two biogeochemical feedbacks, nutrient reallocation and calcification by encrusting marine life, reduce the CDR efficacy of Sargassum by 20â€“100%. Atmospheric CO2 influx into the surface seawater, after CO2-fixation by Sargassum, takes 2.5â€“18 times longer than the CO2-deficient seawater remains in contact with the atmosphere, potentially hindering CDR verification. Furthermore, we estimate that increased ocean albedo, due to floating Sargassum, could influence climate radiative forcing more than Sargassum-CDR. Our analysis shows that multifaceted Earth-system feedbacks determine the efficacy of ocean afforestation.

Insights from the Maldives	Coastal areas host a significant part of the world population and of humankind's adaptation needs in the face of effects of climate change, especially sea-level rise and ocean warming and acidification. Atoll islands illustrate frontline situations due to their biophysical (low elevation, small land area, 360 degrees-exposure to waves, limited natural resources and fragile ecosystems) and human (high population densities in urban environments, low level of development, limited technical and financial capacities) characteristics. In these contexts, it is urgent to understand the space for societal adaptation and based on this, identify robust and context-specific adaptation strategies. This essay builds on the hypothesis that, given the nature of atoll islands, understanding the way and extent to which local human-driven disturbances affect the reef-island system's capacity to provide coastal protection services, is a relevant entry point. Using the case of the Maldives, we propose to combine five types of adaptation into a generic adaptation pathway, and apply it to atoll island types going from no to highly disturbed environments. This work highlights two major conclusions: first, that diverse island profiles require different adaptation pathways; second, that in contexts under high human pressure, the window of opportunities for diversified adaptation strategies is closing fast.	atoll islands; ocean change; adaptation pathways; path-dependency	2020	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91805360	14987	2022.2034	Potential negative effects of ocean afforestation on offshore ecosystems	Ocean afforestation is a proposed method for large-scale carbon dioxide removal, involving exporting rafts of nearshore macroalgae to the open ocean for long-term occupation and then sinking. In this Perspective, the authors caution that this approach has multiple potential ramifications for ocean chemistry and ecology. Our scientific understanding of climate change makes clear the necessity for both emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The ocean with its large surface area, great depths and long coastlines is central to developing CDR approaches commensurate with the scale needed to limit warming to below 2 degrees C. Many proposed marine CDR approaches rely on spatial upscaling along with enhancement and/or acceleration of the rates of naturally occurring processes. One such approach is `ocean afforestation', which involves offshore transport and concurrent growth of nearshore macroalgae (seaweed), followed by their export into the deep ocean. The purposeful occupation for months of open ocean waters by macroalgae, which do not naturally occur there, will probably affect offshore ecosystems through a range of biological threats, including altered ocean chemistry and changed microbial physiology and ecology. Here, we present model simulations of ocean afforestation and link these to lessons from other examples of offshore dispersal, including rafting plastic debris, and discuss the ramifications for offshore ecosystems. We explore what additional metrics are required to assess the ecological implications of this proposed CDR. In our opinion, these ecological metrics must have equal weight to CDR capacity in the development of initial trials, pilot studies and potential licensing.

Here, we conducted omics analyses on the coral Mussismilia hispida exposed to bleaching conditions in a long-term mesocosm experiment and inoculated with a selected BMC consortium or a saline solution placebo. All corals were affected by heat stress, but the observed ``post-heat stress disorder{''} was mitigated by BMCs, signified by patterns of dimethylsulfoniopropionate degradation, lipid maintenance, and coral host transcriptional reprogramming of cellular restructuration, repair, stress protection, and immune genes, concomitant with a 40\% survival rate increase and stable photosynthetic performance by the endosymbiotic algae.

We demonstrate that BMCs trigger a dynamic microbiome restructuring process that instigates genetic and metabolic alterations in the coral host that eventually mitigate coral bleaching and mortality.

91805362	325899	2022.17355	Windfarms, fishing and benthic recovery: Overlaps, risks and opportunities	The UK is a leading nation in the development of large offshore wind energy installations (OWFs). Since 2000, the UK has installed 2610 turbines covering over 2000 km2 of UK seas. As these sites overlap with historic fishing grounds as well as Marine Protected Areas it is important to understand the relationship between the presence of these OWFs and fishing activity to assess the extent to which OWFs could act as de facto MPAs with respect to fisheries management, providing other environmental impacts are mitigated. We assessed the extent to which the fishing activity of vessels using bottom-contacting mobile gears (trawls, dredges and demersal seines) were impacted by the construction of 12 offshore windfarms in the UK EEZ. Using publicly available Global Fishing Watch fishing effort data, we found fishing rate from vessels using bottom-towed gear was reduced by 77 % following OWF construction in 11 of the 12 sites studied. A decline in bottom-towed fishing activity was recorded in OWFs where turbines were constructed in a densely aggregated patch, and an increase in fishing activity where turbines were positioned as several distinct aggregated patches within the site. We conclude that bottom-towed fishing activity is affected by turbine layout, with OWFs likely offering some protection to the benthic environment from bottom-towed gear. We suggest this reduction in bottom-towed fishing provides space for co-location opportunities and note that consultations on domestic MPA designations should involve offshore wind stakeholders in terms of OWF â€˜co-locationâ€™ with and â€˜avoidanceâ€™ of MPAs.

91805363	6134	2020.744	Assessment of coastal risk reduction and adaptation-labelled responses in Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean)	This study assesses changes in coastal risk reduction and adaptation-labelled responses in Mauritius Island since the 1960s. Using research documents, interviews, field observations, image analysis, and case studies, it analyses evolutions in public and private stakeholders' strategies, and the levers and barriers at play. Based on 60 beach sites, it reveals the prevalence (76.7\%) of hard protection compared with no response (8.3\%), ecosystem-based responses (3.3\%), and combined responses (11.7\%) and a nation-wide shift from hard and one-size-fits-all responses to soft and place-specific responses. This shift was driven by the failure of initial hard protection measures, which has pushed the Government of Mauritius to improve beach management practices, promote retreat where hard protection had failed, resort to external expertise and funding to design a well-informed risk reduction and adaptation policy, and implement demonstration projects. The ``learning-by-doing{''} process and increased external support have thus allowed progress in risk reduction and adaptation at publicly managed beach sites. In contrast, privately managed (i.e. by residents and hotel companies) beach sites often exhibit increased risks, as a result of the proliferation of uncoordinated technical interventions, related cascading (beach loss, spread of coastal erosion downdrift), and lock-in effects. This study provides guidance for the ground-rooted and systematic analysis of coastal risk reduction and adaptation responses and their drivers at the local and national scale. It could serve as a first basis for framing nation-wide assessments aimed at taking stock of recent progress in coastal risk reduction and adaptation worldwide and help overcome barriers to adaptation.	coastal risk reduction; climate change adaptation; small island developing states; hard protection; ecosystem-based adaptation; indian ocean	2020	AC	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91805364	12592	2020.1567	Land raising as a solution to sea-level rise: An analysis of coastal flooding on an artificial island in the Maldives	The Maldives (land elevation approximately 1 m above mean sea level) is often associated with the threat of rising sea levels. Land scarcity due to population pressure is also a major issue. In the late 1990s a new 1.9km(2) 1.8 m high artificial island, Hulhumale was created for urban expansion, including an allowance for sea-level rise. This paper assesses flood exposure through an extreme water level scenario on Hulhumale taking into account sea-level rise and analyses potential adaptation options to extend island life. Results indicate that overtopping is likely to occur with 0.6 +/- 0.2 m of sea-level rise, with more severe, widespread flooding with 0.9 +/- 0.2 m of sea-level rise. If the Paris Agreement goals are met, flooding is not anticipated this century. However, under a non-mitigation scenario, flooding could occur by the 2090s. Building seawalls 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 m high could delay flooding for 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m of sea-level rise, respectively. Land raising has been successful in Hulhumale in reducing flood risk simultaneous to addressing development needs. Whilst new land claim and raising can be cost-effective, raising developed land provides greater challenges, such as timeliness with respect to infrastructure design lives or financial costs. Thus the transferability and long-term benefits of land raising requires further consideration.	adaptation; defence; flooding; island; land claim; sea-level rise	2020	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91805365	21283	2022.2607	Offshore wind farms are projected to impact primary production and bottom water deoxygenation in the North Sea	Atmospheric wakes caused by offshore wind farms built in the North Sea may affect marine ecosystems, both at the surface ocean and at the seafloor, according to a numerical modeling study. The wind wake effect of offshore wind farms affects the hydrodynamical conditions in the ocean, which has been hypothesized to impact marine primary production. So far only little is known about the ecosystem response to wind wakes under the premisses of large offshore wind farm clusters. Here we show, via numerical modeling, that the associated wind wakes in the North Sea provoke large-scale changes in annual primary production with local changes of up to +/- 10\% not only at the offshore wind farm clusters, but also distributed over a wider region. The model also projects an increase in sediment carbon in deeper areas of the southern North Sea due to reduced current velocities, and decreased dissolved oxygen inside an area with already low oxygen concentration. Our results provide evidence that the ongoing offshore wind farm developments can have a substantial impact on the structuring of coastal marine ecosystems on basin scales.

91805366	384825	2021.16932	Quantifying the effects of tidal turbine array operations on the distribution of marine mammals: Implications for collision risk	Owing to their predictability, tidal currents are an attractive source of renewable energy. However, data on the environmental impacts, especially at array scale, are lacking. We present a spatial analysis of telemetry data, identifying the effects of the presence and operations of the world's first commercial sized tidal turbine array on the movements of an acoustically sensitive marine mammal; the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina). No significant change in at sea distribution was detected between pre and post installation of the 4 turbine array. However, seals showed overt avoidance responses during turbine operations, with a significant decrease in predicted abundance (95% CIs: âˆ’11%, âˆ’49%) within âˆ¼2 km of the array. These results provide important information for estimating collision rates between seals and tidal turbine arrays and demonstrate an analytical framework which can be used to assess the effect of arrays on other marine animal distributions. Collision risk models used to estimate collision rate between tidal turbines and marine mammals traditionally assume some non-empirical degree of avoidance, or no avoidance. The avoidance response elicited by seals to these devices could reduce the likelihood of direct collisions, with estimated avoidance rates measured here suggesting a decrease in total number of between 0.4% and 2% per annum. Further, given sustained barrier effects were not identified, avoidance may only be occurring during the potentially dangerous periods during operations thereby not restricting movement through the site at all times. However, future environmental impact assessments and spatial planning for array deployments should consider the potential for repulsion of acoustically sensitive top-predators away from ecologically important sites.

91805367	5311	2022.764	Climate adaptation pathways and the role of social-ecological networks in small-scale fisheries	Climate change is expected to have increasing impacts on marine ecosystems which will threaten the livelihoods and wellbeing of millions of people. Drawing on social-ecological network and sociodemographic data collected via face-to-face interviews with 404 small-scale commercial fishers from 9 Galician communities (Spain), we empirically examine the adaptation pathways that fishers follow when they face hypothetical impacts on their fishery resources and test the role of five social-ecological network structures on fisher's stated intended responses to such scenarios. Our results show that fishers generally intend to follow a `remain-adapt-transform-exit (the fishery)' pathway when faced with increasing climate impacts. Next, we demonstrate that trust-based bonding ties and ties to informal leaders are associated with a `business-as-usual' strategy. In contrast, communicative bonding ties are associated with adaptive responses, while communicative bridging ties are associated with transformative and exit strategies. Our findings provide key empirical insight that broaden our understanding of the intricate relationship between social networks and adaptive behaviour relevant to social-ecological systems worldwide.

91805368	459	2020.64	Benefits of coastal managed realignment for society: Evidence from ecosystem service assessments in two UK regions	Coastal managed realignment has the potential to deliver both nature conservation and other benefits to people, but these are rarely quantified. We used an ecosystem services assessment toolkit, TESSA, at two locations in the UK; Hesketh Outmarsh West (northwest England), where realignment has already been carried out, and the Inner Firth of Forth (central Scotland), where realignment is proposed for multiple sites. At the Inner Forth we focus on one site, Inch of Ferryton, in Clackmannanshire but also assess ecosystem services across several sites. Using dedicated data collection where possible, and site appropriate existing data, we estimate the value of these sites to people in the realigned state compared with the most realistic alternative: continued agricultural production behind hard flood defences (agricultural state). Services assessed were climate change mitigation, agricultural production, nature-based recreation, and flood risk protection. At both sites agricultural production was estimated to be greater in the agricultural state, while other services were estimated to be greater in the realigned state. We are cautious about assigning overall monetary values based on biophysical attributes, particularly considering that climate change mitigation is highly sensitive to carbon prices, and that by necessity we were unable to quantify all services. Nevertheless, using a price for carbon that incorporates the societal cost of emissions, we estimate that the net annual provision of services is 262,935 (1460.75 pound/ha) at Hesketh Outmarsh West and 93,216 pound (574.70 pound/ha) at Inch of Ferryton. At both sites, sequestered carbon in accreting sediments outweighs greenhouse gas emissions from intertidal habitats, and the net value of this in turn outweighs the income foregone from crops and grazing. At Hesketh Outmarsh West the value of ecosystem services is increased by the reduction to flood risk arising from the coastal managed realignment action. Nature-based recreation is estimated to increase at both sites under realignment, with the visitor profile expected to be strongly local. Decisions about coastal management, including realignment, should incorporate information about the ecosystem services provided under different scenarios. This applies beyond coastal ecosystems, and the site-scale is often the most appropriate scale to carry out such assessments, as this is the scale at which decisions are often taken.

91805369	56292	2022.5736	The impact of mobile demersal fishing on carbon storage in seabed sediments	Subtidal marine sediments are one of the planet's primary carbon stores and strongly influence the oceanic sink for atmospheric CO2. By far the most widespread human activity occurring on the seabed is bottom trawling/dredging for fish and shellfish. A global first-order estimate suggested mobile demersal fishing activities may cause 0.16-0.4 Gt of organic carbon (OC) to be remineralized annually from seabed sediment carbon stores (Sala et al., 2021). There are, however, many uncertainties in this calculation. Here, we discuss the potential drivers of change in seabed sediment OC stores due to mobile demersal fishing activities and conduct a literature review, synthesizing studies where this interaction has been directly investigated. Under certain environmental settings, we hypothesize that mobile demersal fishing would reduce OC in seabed stores due to lower production of flora and fauna, the loss of fine flocculent material, increased sediment resuspension, mixing and transport and increased oxygen exposure. Reductions would be offset to varying extents by reduced faunal bioturbation and community respiration, increased off-shelf transport and increases in primary production from the resuspension of nutrients. Studies which directly investigated the impact of demersal fishing on OC stocks had mixed results. A finding of no significant effect was reported in 61\% of 49 investigations; 29\% reported lower OC due to fishing activities, with 10\% reporting higher OC. In relation to remineralization rates within the seabed, four investigations reported that demersal fishing activities decreased remineralization, with three reporting higher remineralization rates. Patterns in the environmental and experimental characteristics between different outcomes were largely indistinct. More evidence is urgently needed to accurately quantify the impact of anthropogenic physical disturbance on seabed carbon in different environmental settings and to incorporate full evidence-based carbon considerations into global seabed management.	blue carbon; carbon; carbon storage; dredging; fishing; marine; sediment; trawling	2022	AC	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
91805370	189646	2021.16169	Six priorities to advance the science and practice of coral reef restoration worldwide	Coral reef restoration is a rapidly growing movement galvanized by the accelerating degradation of the world's tropical coral reefs. The need for concerted and collaborative action focused on the recovery of coral reef ecosystems coalesced in the creation of the Coral Restoration Consortium (CRC) in 2017. In March 2020, the CRC leadership team met for a biennial review of international coral reef restoration efforts and a discussion of perceived knowledge and implementation bottlenecks that may impair scalability and efficacy. Herein we present six priorities wherein the CRC will foster scientific advancement and collaboration to: (1) increase restoration efficiency, focusing on scale and cost-effectiveness of deployment; (2) scale up larval-based coral restoration efforts, emphasizing recruit health, growth, and survival; (3) ensure restoration of threatened coral species proceeds within a population-genetics management context; (4) support a holistic approach to coral reef ecosystem restoration; (5) develop and promote the use of standardized terms and metrics for coral reef restoration; and (6) support coral reef restoration practitioners working in diverse geographic locations. These priorities are not exhaustive nor do we imply that accomplishing these tasks alone will be sufficient to restore coral reefs globally; rather these are topics where we feel the CRC community of practice can make timely and significant contributions to facilitate the growth of coral reef restoration as a practical conservation strategy. The goal for these collective actions is to provide tangible, local-scale advancements in reef condition that offset declines resulting from local and global stressors including climate change.	corals; coral interventions; coral reefs; coral restoration; reefs; restoration	2021	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91805371	245362	2020.18386	Greening of grey infrastructure should not be used as a Trojan horse to facilitate coastal development	Climate change and coastal urbanization are driving the replacement of natural habitats with artificial structures and reclaimed land globally. These novel habitats are often poor surrogates for natural habitats. The application of integrated greening of grey infrastructure (IGGI) to artificial shorelines demonstrates how multifunctional structures can provide biodiversity benefits whilst simultaneously serving their primary engineering function. IGGI is being embraced globally, despite many knowledge gaps and limitations. It is a management tool to compensate anthropogenic impacts as part of the Mitigation Hierarchy. There is considerable scope for misuse and `greenwashing' however, by making new developments appear more acceptable, thus facilitating the regulatory process. We encourage researchers to exercise caution when reporting on small-scale experimental trials. We advocate that greater attention is paid to when experiments `fail' or yield unintended outcomes. We advise revisiting, repeating and expanding on experiments to test responses over broader spatio-temporal scales to improve the evidence base. Synthesis and applications. Where societal and economic demand makes development inevitable, particular attention should be paid to avoiding, minimizing and rehabilitating environmental impacts. Integrated greening of grey infrastructure (IGGI) should be implemented as partial compensation for environmental damage. Mutual benefits for both humans and nature can be achieved when IGGI is implemented retrospectively in previously developed or degraded environments. We caution, however, that any promise of net biodiversity gain from new developments should be scrutinized and any local ecological benefits set in the context of the wider environmental impacts. A `greened' development will always impinge on natural systems, a reality that is much less recognized in the sea than on land.	biodiversity offsetting; dual-use dilemma; environmental damage; integrated greening of grey infrastructure; marine planning; mitigation hierarchy; novel ecosystem; sustainable development	2020	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91805372	2498	2021.354	Tidal and Nontidal Marsh Restoration: A Trade-Off Between Carbon Sequestration, Methane Emissions, and Soil Accretion	Support for coastal wetland restoration projects that consider carbon (C) storage as a climate mitigation benefit is growing as coastal wetlands are sites of substantial C sequestration. However, the climate footprint of wetland restoration remains controversial as wetlands can also be large sources of methane (CH4). We quantify the vertical fluxes of C in restored fresh and oligohaline nontidal wetlands with managed hydrology and a tidal euhaline marsh in California's San Francisco Bay-Delta. We combine the use of eddy covariance atmospheric flux measurements with Pb-210-derived soil C accumulation rates to quantify the C sequestration efficiency of restored wetlands and their associated climate mitigation service. Nontidal managed wetlands were the most efficient in burying C on-site, with soil C accumulation rates as high as their net atmospheric C uptake (-280 +/- 90 and -350 +/- 150 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). In contrast, the restored tidal wetland exhibited lower C burial rates over decadal timescales (70 +/- 19 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) that accounted for similar to 13\%-23\% of its annual C uptake, suggesting that the remaining fraction is exported via lateral hydrologic flux. From an ecosystem radiative balance perspective, the restored tidal wetland showed a > 10 times higher CO2-sequestration to CH4-emission ratio than the nontidal managed wetlands. Thus overall, tidal wetland restoration resulted in a negative radiative forcing (cooling) through increased soil C accumulation, while nontidal wetland restoration led to an early positive forcing (warming) through increased CH4 emissions potentially lasting between 2.1 +/- 2.0 to 8 +/- 4 decades.	wetland restoration; soil carbon; eddy covariance; methane; carbon sequestration; san francisco bay-delta	2021	AC	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91805373	7288	NA.104	Potential of seagrass habitat restorations as nature-based solutions: Practical and scientific implications in Indonesia	Seagrasses offer diverse ecosystem services, yet, they are among the most threatened ecosystems. When degraded or destroyed, their services are lost or reduced in the process, affecting, for instance, local communities directly dependent on their livelihood provision. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that climate change is projected to worsen over time; thus, there is an urgent need for mitigation strategies in practice and also in the longer term. This work aims to provide an alternative perspective of seagrass restoration as a nature based solution (NbS) on a global scale, yet, giving an emphasis on tropical regions such as Indonesia. We focused on seagrass restorations which are not yet well established in comparison with other restoration programs (e.g., mangroves) despite their critical roles. We present in this work how restoring seagrass meadows fits the global standard of NbS published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The results of this study can serve as a basis for promoting seagrass restorations as NbS against climate change particularly in countries with a wide extent of seagrass coverage.	blue carbon; climate change mitigation; ecosystem services; local stakeholders; societal challenges	NA	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0
91805374	57685	2022.5859	Blue carbon sequestration following mangrove restoration: evidence from a carbon neutral case in China	Sequestration of blue carbon (C) in mangrove plantations depends on site characteristics and plantation management. This study evaluated the effects of plantation management on C sequestration at a C-neutral site in Xiamen, China. A field study was conducted on 10-year-old Sonneratia apetala and Kandelia obovata plantations (mono-Sa, mono-Ko) and a 15-year-old mixed plantation-. We found that mono-Ko had a significantly higher ecosystem C sequestration rate (3.32 +/- 0.62 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) than others when planted in the indirect shade of pioneer species. As a non-native species, Sonneratia performed better (0.57 +/- 0.01 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) when planted with Kandelia than in monotypic plantations. The temporary and long-term certified emission reduction (tCER and lCER) of the 12.98 ha mono-Ko was 4103.89 and 3693.50 net CO2-e within 10 years, respectively. A literature review was conducted to show the compatibility of this study with other natural and plantation sites of China and Bangladesh (the native habitat for Sonneratia). The C sequestration of Sonneratia plantation sites in China is comparable with those in Bangladesh. However, the soil C accumulation rate for a Sonneratia monotypic plantation in Bangladesh decreased with age, yet the same did not occur in the plantations of China.	blue carbon; mangrove; carbon density; carbon accumulation; plantation type	2022	AC	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However, they face major challenges, including the increasing effects of climate change that pose serious risks to coastal ecosystems and fishing communities. Although scientific research on climate change impacts has increased in recent years, few studies have explored the social impacts on small-scale fisheries. Using Galicia (Spain) as a case study, we investigated individual and household-level adaptive responses to climate change among fishers in three fishing guilds (Cambados, Campelo, and Redondela). Specifically, we estimated the economic vulnerability of shellfishers and assessed the diversity of social adaptive responses used to deal with climate change. Although fishers' income strongly depends on shellfishing in all studied areas, our findings show that less fishing experience and lower engagement in fisher associations tend to increase the economic vulnerability of the fishers. The fishers' vulnerability decreases as the size of households increases, while fishers who pay a mortgage and who live in households with fewer active members tend to be more vulnerable. The findings also show that Galician shellfishers have developed a wide range of adaptation strategies to anticipate and respond to climate change impacts, namely harvesting pricier and more abundant species, reducing household expenses and increasing social involvement in shellfishery associations. Although the adaptive strategies have helped Galician fishers to deal with climate change impacts, several threats to the sustainability of shellfisheries remain, such as a decrease in the abundance of key native shellfish species, and a high dependence on public and private aid to ensure reasonable incomes for shellfisheries. These findings are of interest and relevance to other similar small-scale fisheries around the world facing similar climate change challenges.	artisanal fisheries; climate change; vulnerability; social adaptation; galicia; spain	2022	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91805376	189301	2022.16124	Assessing the potential for demographic restoration and assisted evolution to build climate resilience in coral reefs	Interest is growing in developing conservation strategies to restore and maintain coral reef ecosystems in the face of mounting anthropogenic stressors, particularly climate warming and associated mass bleaching events. One such approach is to propagate coral colonies ex situ and transplant them to degraded reef areas to augment habitat for reef-dependent fauna, prevent colonization from spatial competitors, and enhance coral reproductive output. In addition to such ``demographic restoration{''} efforts, manipulating the thermal tolerance of outplanted colonies through assisted relocation, selective breeding, or genetic engineering is being considered for enhancing rates of evolutionary adaptation to warming. Although research into such ``assisted evolution{''} strategies has been growing, their expected performance remains unclear. We evaluated the potential outcomes of demographic restoration and assisted evolution in climate change scenarios using an eco-evolutionary simulation model. We found that supplementing reefs with pre-existing genotypes (demographic restoration) offers little climate resilience benefits unless input levels are large and maintained for centuries. Supplementation with thermally resistant colonies was successful at improving coral cover at lower input levels, but only if maintained for at least a century. Overall, we found that, although demographic restoration and assisted evolution have the potential to improve long-term coral cover, both approaches had a limited impact in preventing severe declines under climate change scenarios. Conversely, with sufficient natural genetic variance and time, corals could readily adapt to warming temperatures, suggesting that restoration approaches focused on building genetic variance may outperform those based solely on introducing heat-tolerant genotypes.	assisted evolution; climate change; coral bleaching; coral reef restoration; evolutionary rescue	2022	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91805377	284831	2022.2944	Implementation of blue carbon offset crediting for seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds, and macroalgae farming in Japan	The â€œblue carbonâ€ concept and the role of blue carbon stored in shallow coastal ecosystems in mitigating climate change have attracted attention worldwide. In addition to typical blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangroves, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds and macroalgae farming are also gaining recognition as potential blue carbon sinks. Effective policies and methodologies are important for the conservation and expansion of blue carbon sinks, as well as the consequent reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). One of the most effective methods is carbon offset credit schemes. However, to date, almost all credit schemes have been implemented for mangroves and saltmarshes. None has been implemented for seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds, and macroalgae farming, although their CO2 uptake potentials are large. Here, we review three blue carbon offset credit projects for seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds, and macroalgae farming implemented in Japan. We show the blue carbon offset crediting projects of (1) Yokohama City, the first in the world; (2) Fukuoka City, the second such project in Japan; and (3) the first Japanese national governmental demonstration project. Furthermore, we highlight their characteristics by comparing them with the other blue carbon offset projects. Finally, we discuss the need to accelerate blue carbon offset credit projects and related initiatives in the future.

91805378	56442	2021.5581	Blue carbon as a natural climate solution	Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), including mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, store carbon and provide co-benefits such as coastal protection and fisheries enhancement. Blue carbon sequestration has therefore been suggested as a natural climate solution. In this Review, we examine the potential for BCEs to act as carbon sinks and the opportunities to protect or restore ecosystems for this function. Globally, BCEs are calculated to store >30,000 Tg C across similar to 185 million ha, with their conservation potentially avoiding emissions of 304 (141-466) Tg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) per year. Potential BCE restoration has been estimated in the range of 0.2-3.2 million ha for tidal marshes, 8.3-25.4 million ha for seagrasses and 9-13 million ha for mangroves, which could draw down an additional 841 (621-1,064) Tg CO(2)e per year by 2030, collectively amounting to similar to 3\% of global emissions (based on 2019 and 2020 global annual fossil fuel emissions). Mangrove protection and/or restoration could provide the greatest carbon-related benefits, but better understanding of other BCEs is needed. BCE destruction is unlikely to stop fully, and not all losses can be restored. However, engineering and planning for coastal protection offer opportunities for protection and restoration, especially through valuing co-benefits. BCE prioritization is potentially a cost-effective and scalable natural climate solution, but there are still barriers to overcome before blue carbon project adoption will become widespread.

However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the ecological and physical benefits, and how they could inform management needs. To address this, we studied effectiveness of living shorelines at a broad spatial scale within the Washington State boundaries of the Salish Sea, USA, with restored site ages spanning 1-11 years. We surveyed 30 beaches at ten locations, each with three strata of: (1) living shoreline beaches with armor removed, (2) armored control beaches altered by seawalls or riprap, and (3) un-armored reference beaches with natural conditions. We sampled eight physical and biological attributes: beach wrack, wrack invertebrates, sediments, terrestrial insects, riparian vegetation, logs, beach profiles, and stable isotope signatures of talitrid amphipods - generating 27 metrics focusing on upper intertidal and supratidal elevations affected by armoring and targeted by living shoreline actions. These metrics spanned the functions of beach stability, ecological diversity, and food web support for juvenile salmon. Statistical tests showed that 19 of the 27 metrics had significant strata differences, indicating that some beach metrics restore quickly (e.g., wrack accumulation), while others take longer (e.g., log accumulation). Terrestrial-associated metrics were higher at reference beaches, but insect taxa richness and logs with plant growth increased at beaches restored for four or more years (the average age of the living shoreline sites). This implies that certain living shoreline functions increase through time, providing improved food web support. Globally, trajectories of restoration have shown a range of functional improvement with time, and will be important to monitor for nature-based solutions to coastal defense given the increasing rate of shoreline stressors from global change and sea level rise.	restore; shores; armoring; invertebrates; habitat	2021	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91805380	10944	NA.144	Potential use of engineered nanoparticles in ocean fertilization for large-scale atmospheric carbon dioxide removal	This Analysis considers the potential benefits and challenges of applying engineered nanoparticles for artificial-ocean-fertilization-driven carbon sequestration Artificial ocean fertilization (AOF) aims to safely stimulate phytoplankton growth in the ocean and enhance carbon sequestration. AOF carbon sequestration efficiency appears lower than natural ocean fertilization processes due mainly to the low bioavailability of added nutrients, along with low export rates of AOF-produced biomass to the deep ocean. Here we explore the potential application of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) to overcome these issues. Data from 123 studies show that some ENPs may enhance phytoplankton growth at concentrations below those likely to be toxic in marine ecosystems. ENPs may also increase bloom lifetime, boost phytoplankton aggregation and carbon export, and address secondary limiting factors in AOF. Life-cycle assessment and cost analyses suggest that net CO2 capture is possible for iron, SiO2 and Al2O3 ENPs with costs of 2-5 times that of conventional AOF, whereas boosting AOF efficiency by ENPs should substantially enhance net CO2 capture and reduce these costs. Therefore, ENP-based AOF can be an important component of the mitigation strategy to limit global warming.

Here, we focus on the implementation of pre-emptive managed retreat, providing examples of how it can be sequenced, socialised and given the governance enablers necessary for implementation. Recent Findings Ongoing sea-level rise during the twenty-first century and beyond poses huge adaptation challenges, especially for low-lying coastal and floodplain settlements. Settlements are already functionally disrupted from repetitive non-extreme flooding and research shows that sea-level rise will impact far more people, far sooner than previously thought, as more powerful storms, heavy rainfall and rising groundwater coincide with higher tides. To date, most examples of managed retreat have been post-disaster responses following damage and disruption. Pre-emptive managed retreat, by contrast, has yet to become a well-accepted and widely practised adaptation response. Nevertheless, there are increasing examples of research and practice on how pre-emptive managed retreat can be designed, sequenced and implemented alongside other forms of adaptation within anticipatory forms of governance. The current state of knowledge about managed retreat is reviewed and critical insights and lessons for governance and policy-making are given. Several novel examples from New Zealand are presented to address some of the implementation gaps. Goals and principles are enunciated to inform long-term adaptation strategies.	adaptation; managed retreat; sea-level rise; dynamic adaptive pathways; compensation; anticipatory governance	2020	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91805382	271	2020.34	Realistic fisheries management reforms could mitigate the impacts of climate change in most countries	Although climate change is altering the productivity and distribution of marine fisheries, climate-adaptive fisheries management could mitigate many of the negative impacts on human society. We forecast global fisheries biomass, catch, and profits to 2100 under three climate scenarios (RCPs 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) and five levels of management reform to (1) determine the impact of climate change on national fisheries and (2) quantify the national-scale benefits of implementing climate-adaptive fisheries reforms. Management reforms accounting for shifting productivity and shifting distributions would yield higher catch and profits in the future relative to today for 60-65\% of countries under the two least severe climate scenarios but for only 35\% of countries under the most severe scenario. Furthermore, these management reforms would yield higher cumulative catch and profits than business-asusual management for nearly all countries under the two least severe climate scenarios but would yield lower cumulative catch for 40\% of countries under the most severe scenario. Fortunately, perfect fisheries management is not necessary to achieve these benefits: transboundary cooperation with 5-year intervals between adaptive interventions would result in comparable outcomes. However, the ability for realistic management reforms to offset the negative impacts of climate change is bounded by changes in underlying biological productivity. Although realistic reforms could generate higher catch and profits for 23-50\% of countries experiencing reductions in productivity, the remaining countries would need to develop, expand, and reform aquaculture and other food production sectors to offset losses in capture fisheries. Still, climate-adaptive management is more profitable than business-as-usual management in all countries and we provide guidance on implementing-and achieving the benefits of-climate-adaptive fisheries reform along a gradient of scientific, management, and enforcement capacities.

91805383	178623	2021.16023	Global potential and limits of mangrove blue carbon for climate change mitigation	Despite the outsized role of mangrove forests in sustaining biodiversity, ecosystem function, and local livelihoods, the protection of these vital habitats through blue carbon financing has been limited.(1,2) Here, we quantify the extent of this missed conservation and financial opportunity, showing that the protection of-20\% of the world's mangrove forests (2.6 Mha) can be funded through carbon financing. Of these investible areas, 1.1-1.3 Mha can be financially sustainable over a 30-year time frame based on carbon prices of US\$5-9.4 t(-1)CO(2)e. This contributes up to 29.8 MtCO(2)e year(-1) and yields a return on investment of similar to US\$3.7 billion per year. Our results point toward a disproportionately large potential of blue carbon finance that can be leveraged to meet national-level climate mitigation goals, particularly if combined with other conservation interventions that further safeguard carbon stocks and biodiversity in these irreplaceable forests. Robust information on return on investment highlights the potential for currently underutilized tropical coastal carbon credit projects.

91813122	211447	2005.1913	The potential for created oyster shell reefs as a sustainable shoreline protection strategy in Louisiana	Coastal protection remains a global priority. Protection and maintenance of shoreline integrity is often a goal of many coastal protection programs. Typically, shorelines are protected by armoring them with hard, non-native, and nonsustainable materials such as limestone. This study investigated the potential shoreline protection role of created, three-dimensional Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) shell reefs fringing eroding marsh shorelines in Louisiana. Experimental reefs (25 X 1.0 X 0.7 m; intertidal) were created in June 2002 at both high and low wave energy shorelines. Six 25-m study sites (three cultched and three control noncultched) were established at each shoreline in June 2002, for a total of 12 sites. Shoreline retreat was reduced in cultched low-energy shorelines as compared to the control low-energy shorelines (analysis of variance; p < 0.001) but was not significantly different between cultched and noncultched sites in high-energy environments. Spat set increased from 0.5 +/- 0.1 spat/shell in July 2002 to a peak of 9.5 +/- 0.4 spat/shell in October 2002. On average, oyster spat grew at a rate of 0.05 mm/day through the duration of the study. Recruitment and growth rates of oyster spat suggested potential reef sustainability over time. Small fringing reefs may be a useful tool in protecting shorelines in low-energy environments. However, their usefulness may be limited in high-energy environments.	crassostrea virginica; fish; louisiana; oyster reefs; restoration; shoreline protection	2005	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

For the first time, a global ocean biogeochemical model has been evaluated against those experiments and then used to estimate the effect of a long-term and large-scale iron addition on atmospheric CO2. The model reproduces the observed timing and amplitude in chlorophyll, the shift in ecosystem composition, and the pCO(2) drawdown; it also proves to be of utility in interpreting the observations. However, a full ocean fertilization during 100 years results in a 33 mu atm decrease in atmospheric CO2, that is 2 to 3 times smaller than found previously.

91813124	149575	2016.6794	Could artificial ocean alkalinization protect tropical coral ecosystems from ocean acidification?	Artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) is investigated as a method to mitigate local ocean acidification and protect tropical coral ecosystems during a 21st century high CO2 emission scenario. Employing an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, our implementation of AOA in the Great Barrier Reef, Caribbean Sea and South China Sea regions, shows that alkalinization has the potential to counteract expected 21st century local acidification in regard to both oceanic surface aragonite saturation Omega and surface pCO(2). Beyond preventing local acidification, regional AOA, however, results in locally elevated aragonite oversaturation and pCO(2) decline. A notable consequence of stopping regional AOA is a rapid shift back to the acidified conditions of the target regions. We conclude that AOA may be a method that could help to keep regional coral ecosystems within saturation states and pCO(2) values close to present-day values even in a high-emission scenario and thereby might `buy some time' against the ocean acidification threat, even though regional AOA does not significantly mitigate the warming threat.	coral reef; geoengineering; ocean alkalinization; ocean acidification; climate engineering; weathering enhancement	2016	AC	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Blue carbon, the carbon fixed by vegetated coastal ecosystems including seagrasses, is reported to have a large potential to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide. Planting, expanding or protecting seagrass meadows has, accordingly, been proposed as a form of geoengineering. Seagrasses are reported to account for up to 18\% of the carbon burial in the world's oceans, which is on the same order of magnitude as other proposed geoengineering techniques, including iron fertilization. International protocols have been developed to quantify carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows, with a view to awarding carbon credits under the Verified Carbon Standard. Unfortunately, because these protocols do not adequately account for post-depositional processes in marine sediment, they significantly overestimate carbon capture by seagrass beds and give an incorrect view of its distribution. Specifically, neglecting biomixing and remineralization of carbon in surface sediments biases burial rates high, while using sediment carbon inventory (soil carbon stock) over the top 1 m as a proxy for burial rate incorrectly identifies areas of high carbon burial. Seagrass beds likely provide a limited setting for geoengineering, because they generally comprise slowly-accumulating, fine to medium sand, which captures organic carbon less efficiently than fine-grained sediments or rapidly-accumulating delta deposits. While there is no question that seagrass meadows provide valuable habitat, nor that they are disappearing rapidly, their contribution to the global burial of carbon has not yet been established. The danger of geoengineering with seagrasses before reliable assessment methods have been established is that overestimated carbon offsets could lead to a net increase in emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.	geoengineering; blue carbon; marine sediment; organic carbon; climate change	2016	AC	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91813126	235855	2015.12116	Sustainable artificial island concept for the Republic of Kiribati	Global warming and rising sea levels are increasingly causing major problems for low lying Pacific and Indian Ocean island nations. The Republic of Kiribati in the South Pacific is currently in a dire situation, and increasing levels of international aid will be required to maintain the population at its current standard of living. This paper describes a sustainable artificial island, designed for the inhabitants of South Tarawa, the capital island of the Republic of Kiribati. Design targets were to improve infrastructure, services and quality of life for the inhabitants, to increase island sustainability and to minimise construction costs. Transition to an artificial island is a feasible option with significant international support, and would enable survival for the population of South Tarawa with minimum disruption to their current lifestyle.

91813127	333922	2016.11135	The influence of waves on the tidal kinetic energy resource at a tidal stream energy site	Successful deployment of tidal energy converters relies on access to accurate and high resolution numerical assessments of available tidal stream power. However, since suitable tidal stream sites are located in relatively shallow waters of the continental shelf where tidal currents are enhanced, tidal energy converters may experience effects of wind-generated surface-gravity waves. Waves may thus influence tidal currents, and associated kinetic energy, through two non-linear processes: the interaction of wave and current bottom boundary layers, and the generation of wave-induced currents. Here, we develop a three-dimensional tidal circulation model coupled with a phase-averaged wave model to quantify the impact of the waves on the tidal kinetic energy resource of the Fromveur Strait (western Brittany) - a region that has been identified with strong potential for tidal array development. Numerical results are compared with in situ observations of wave parameters (significant wave height, peak period and mean wave direction) and current amplitude and direction 10Â m above the seabed (the assumed technology hub height for this region). The introduction of waves is found to improve predictions of tidal stream power at 10Â m above the seabed at the measurement site in the Strait, reducing kinetic energy by up to 9% during storm conditions. Synoptic effects of wave radiation stresses and enhanced bottom friction are more specifically identified at the scale of the Strait. Waves contribute to a slight increase in the spatial gradient of available mean tidal stream potential between the north-western area and the south-eastern part of the Strait. At the scale of the region within the Strait that has been identified for tidal stream array development, the available mean spring tidal stream potential is furthermore reduced by 12% during extreme waves conditions. Isolated effects of wave radiation stresses and enhanced bottom friction lead to a reduction in spring tidal potential of 7.8% and 5.3%, respectively. It is therefore suggested that models used for tidal resource assessment consider the effect of waves in appropriately wave-exposed regions.

91813128	44202	2009.1396	Marine renewable energy: potential benefits to biodiversity? An urgent call for research	P>1. The evidence for anthropogenically induced climate change is overwhelming with the production of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels being a key driver. In response, many governments have initiated programmes of energy production from renewable sources. 2. The marine environment presents a relatively untapped energy source and offshore installations are likely to produce a significant proportion of future energy production. Wind power is the most advanced, with development of wave and tidal energy conversion devices expected to increase worldwide in the near future. 3. Concerns over the potential impacts on biodiversity of marine renewable energy installations (MREI) include: habitat loss, collision risks, noise and electromagnetic fields. These factors have been posited as having potentially important negative environmental impacts. 4. Conversely, we suggest that if appropriately managed and designed, MREI may increase local biodiversity and potentially benefit the wider marine environment. Installations have the capacity to act as both artificial reefs and fish aggregation devices, which have been used previously to facilitate restoration of damaged ecosystems, and de facto marine-protected areas, which have proven successful in enhancing both biodiversity and fisheries. 5. The deployment of MREI has the potential to cause conflict among interest groups including energy companies, the fishing sector and environmental groups. Conflicts should be minimized by integrating key stakeholders into the design, siting, construction and operational phases of the installations, and by providing clear evidence of their potential environmental benefits. 6. Synthesis and applications. MREI have the potential to be both detrimental and beneficial to the environment but the evidence base remains limited. To allow for full biodiversity impacts to be assessed, there exists an urgent need for additional multi and inter-disciplinary research in this area ranging from engineering to policy. Whilst there are a number of factors to be considered, one of the key decisions facing current policy makers is where installations should be sited, and, dependent upon site, whether they should be designed to either minimize negative environmental impacts or as facilitators of ecosystem restoration.	artificial reefs; environmental impact; fish aggregation devices; marine-protected areas; wave power; wind farm; wind power	2009	AC	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

To operationalize coastal wetland ecosystem services for decision-making, there is a need to clarify how salt marshes and mangroves function in this region. The goal of this research is to operationalize blue carbon (carbon stored in coastal habitats) within the Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve, TX by documenting what we know about blue carbon within the study area, identifying data gaps and future research needs, and using available knowledge to inform management and decision-making within the Reserve. Our research shows that there is a lack of data within the Reserve on mangrove aboveground biomass, belowground biomass and soil carbon and on salt marsh soil carbon. There is also a dearth of information on wetland carbon sequestration and emission rates within the Reserve, making it challenging to inform management and develop a market for blue carbon.

91759608	244559	2020.18162	Optimising usage of salinized lands in the lower part of the river basin for the coastal community in Bentota, Sri Lanka	Land degradation in coastal areas due to seawater intrusion, and coastal salinity is one of the major critical problems affecting the sustainable development of Sri Lanka. Coastal salinity risk is increasing in the Bentota area while diminishing land productivity which results in poor food production and giving rise to several socio-economic issues for the community in the area. Bentota is below the agricultural production capacity level and no strategy has been implemented or introduced so far regarding the utilisation of degraded lands in the area. This study identified the optimised extent of salinized lands for paddy, coconut, vegetables, fruits, tea, rubber and cinnamon cultivations based on future coastal salinity effects, land use demand and the development trend of the area. Land use change, rainfall, temperature, topography, floods, soil, ground and surface water are the factors applied in evaluations of land use suitability as the prior requirement for land use optimisation. Future demands of land use were predicted applying population growth models, the theory of land carrying capacity and the ecological footprint. Strategies for optimising the productivity of salinized lands were identified using a stakeholder perception-based approach. The developed sustainable land use pattern will enhance the land productivity of highly (3.4 \%), moderately (39.6 \%) and slightly (57 \%) salinized areas in Bentota. Identified land management strategies will facilitate the spatial planning of future land use of this area by providing guidance to the local authority in the process of allocating salinized lands for enhancing land productivity.	future demand analysis; land use pattern; linear programming model; population forecasting; optimising salinized lands; seawater intrusion	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91759615	143	2021.10	Flood Mitigation in Mediterranean Coastal Regions: Problems, Solutions, and Stakeholder Involvement	Flooding affects Mediterranean coastal areas, with negative impacts on regional populations and ecosystems. This paper reviews the causes and consequences of coastal flooding in European Mediterranean countries, common and advanced solutions implemented to mitigate flood risk, and the importance of stakeholder involvement in developing these solutions. Climate change, intensive urbanization, tourism, deforestation, wildfires, and erosion are the main causes of coastal flooding, leading to social and economic losses, degradation of ecosystems, and water and soil contamination due to saltwater intrusion. Various measures for mitigating urban coastal flooding have been implemented, including coastal barriers, infrastructural drainage systems, wetlands, and mobile dams. Development and implementation of such solutions should be performed in close collaboration with stakeholders, but their current engagement at the coordination and/or decision-making level does not allow full integration of local knowledge in flood mitigation projects. Various processes are used to engage stakeholders in coastal flood mitigation, but participatory approaches are required to integrate their perspectives into performance analysis of potential solutions. Such approaches would allow a balance to be reached between nature conservation, market forces, stakeholder needs, and decision-makers' priorities, resulting in development of innovative and sustainable mitigation solutions to enhance urban resilience to coastal flooding.	coastal flooding; flood mitigation measures; stakeholder engagement; mediterranean region	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Design/methodology/approach A participatory process involving the community and institutional stakeholders was carried out to select and prioritise adaptation measures to reduce the erosion of sandy beaches, dunes and bluffs due to extreme wind storm surge and rainfall, SLR and mismanagement practices. The recovery of coastal ecosystems was implemented through soft measures (green infrastructure) such as revegetation with native species, dune regeneration, sustainable drainage systems and the reduction of use pressures. Findings Main achievements of this case study include capacity building of municipal staff and stakeholders, knowledge exchanges with national-level decision makers and scientists and the incorporation of EbA approaches by subnational-level coastal governments. To consolidate EbA, the local government introduced innovations in the coastal management institutional structure. Originality/value The outcomes of the article include, besides the increase in the resilience of social-ecological systems, the strengthening of socio-institutional behaviour, structure and sustainability. This experience provides insights for developing a strategy for both Integrated Coastal Management and climate adaptation at the national scale.	stakeholders; green infrastructure; climate vulnerability; integrated coastal management; rio de la plata estuary coast; socio-institutional capacity building	2018	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1

GIS-based site analysis of an optimal offshore wind farm for minimizing coastal disasters. In: Lee, J.L.; Suh, K.-S.; Lee, B.; Shin, S., and Lee, J. (eds.), Crisis and Integrated Management for Coastal and Marine Safety. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 114, pp. 246-250. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The horizontal force transmitted to the turbine and the substructure of a wind power system is very important factor in system safety, and such a system is particularly vulnerable to large-scale coastal disasters such as earthquakes and typhoons. Wind power systems built offshore and on coasts have reduced economic efficiency due to the increase in initial investment costs, because they require a more robust design when installed in areas vulnerable to coastal disasters. The western and southern seas of Korea have a relatively shallow water depth, which is advantageous for the construction of offshore wind farms. However, since it is close to the Pacific Rim, the probability of an earthquake is relatively high compared to those in other regions, and the frequency of typhoons is higher as well, so a more detailed site analysis is necessary. In this study, the GIS technique was used to select an optimal site for wind farms with a focus on reducing the risk of coastal disasters. The current state of earthquakes in the western and southern seas of Korea as well as the movement path and intensity of typhoons affecting or passing through the western and southern seas were also analyzed in a complex manner. As a result, an optimal site for an offshore wind farm with the lowest risk of coastal disasters was analyzed. Â© 2021 Coastal Education Research Foundation Inc..

91759627	21836	2017.1647	Unpacking Changes in Mangrove Social-Ecological Systems: Lessons from Brazil, Zanzibar, and Vietnam	Mangroves provide multiple benefits, from carbon storage and shoreline protection to food and energy for natural resource-dependent coastal communities. However, they are coming under increasing pressure from climate change, coastal development, and aquaculture. There is increasing need to better understand the changes mangroves face and whether these changes differ or are similar in different parts of the world. Using a multiple case study approach, focused on Vietnam, Zanzibar, and Brazil, this research analyzed the drivers, pressures, states, impacts, and responses (DPSIR) of mangrove systems. A qualitative content analysis was used on a purposively sampled document set for each country to identify and collate evidence under each of the DPSIR categories. Population growth and changing political and economic processes were key drivers across the three countries, leading to land use change and declining states of mangroves. This had an impact on the delivery of regulatory and provisioning ecosystem services from mangroves and on the welfare of coastal communities. Responses have been predominantly regulatory and aim to improve mangrove states, but without always considering ecosystem services or the consequences for welfare. The issue of scale emerged as a critical factor with drivers, pressures, impacts, and responses operating at different levels (from international to local), with consequences for response effectiveness.	coastal management; complex systems; welfare; livelihoods; forests; environmental management	2017	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91759630	242350	2021.6185	Geomorphological Changes of a Migrating Sandbank: Multidecadal Analysis as a Tool for Managing Conflicts in Coastal Use	While beach erosion and sand loss are typically of great concern to the tourism industry, managing rapid morphological changes linked to large amounts of moving sediments is the challenge facing Grado, an important seaside resort in the northern Adriatic, Italy. The cause of the unusual management conflict is the presence of the Mula di Muggia Bank, a nearshore depositional system made up of relict and active migrating sandbanks extending up to 2 km seawards from the touristic beachfront. A reconstruction of the morpho-sedimentary evolution of the coastal system over a 200-year period was done using a large dataset which includes historical cartography, topographic maps, aerial photos and topo-bathymetric surveys. The results show the growth of a significant urban development aimed at creating a tourist destination by occupying the waterfront along fetch-limited coastal tracts with very shallow water and scarce hydrodynamics. Furthermore, a number of sandy dynamic landforms (longshore migrating bars, a bypass corridor, an ebb-tidal delta) and accumulation zones attest to a sediment excess which can be mostly attributed to the eastern river supplies. The progressive constant migration rate of 12.6 my(-1) allowed the bank to induce the expansion of the low-energy silty backbarrier environment, characterised by abundant seagrass meadows a short distance directly in front of the tourist beaches of Grado. As a result of historical analysis and more current observations, areas with diverse morphosedimentary features and with varying tourist/recreational, ecological, and conservation values have been identified. These can be considered as basic units for future accurate planning and re-evaluation of coastal management choices to balance environmental protection and tourist use. A soft coastal defence approach is proposed which includes either the preservation of specific environments or the proper use of excess sand for beach nourishment via periodic dredging or sediment bypassing.	sandbank; migration; barrier; backbarrier; shoreline analysis; historical evolution; coastal zone management	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1

91759637	306024	2019.870	Relative sea-level change regulates organic carbon accumulation in coastal habitats	Because coastal habitats store large amounts of organic carbon (C org ), the conservation and restoration of these habitats are considered to be important measures for mitigating global climate change. Although future sea-level rise is predicted to change the characteristics of these habitats, its impact on their rate of C org sequestration is highly uncertain. Here we used historical depositional records to show that relative sea-level (RSL) changes regulated C org accumulation rates in boreal contiguous seagrassâ€“saltmarsh habitats. Ageâ€“depth modeling and geological and biogeochemical approaches indicated that C org accumulation rates varied as a function of changes in depositional environments and habitat relocations. In particular, C org accumulation rates were enhanced in subtidal seagrass meadows during times of RSL rise, which were caused by postseismic land subsidence and climate change. Our findings identify historical analogs for the future impact of RSL rise driven by global climate change on rates of C org sequestration in coastal habitats. Â© 2018 The Authors.

Offshore wind is characterized by its sustainability and cleanliness, and is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy in recent years. Various methodologies have been therefore utilized to support offshore wind power investment decision-making. However, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive analysis and summary of these methods aimed at improving investment efficiency. To this end, this paper undertakes a systematic literature review of methodologies and theories commonly used in offshore wind power investment decision-making, following with the characteristics, applicability of various methods discussed and discussion of representative literature. Then, the selected papers were classified by the year of publication (2010e2020), journals, country of author affiliation, method consideration perspectives and application fields. These classifications are presented to highlight the trends, which aim to provide broad, systematic approaches and tools for assessment of power investment, and to give suggestions on which method to use for each situation. It can be seen that the popularity and applicability of these methods have improved after 2015. They cannot replace but complement each other and should be implemented in a parallel or better comprehensive way. The outputs of this review will map appropriate analytical techniques to specific investment applications and perspectives, provide researchers with guidance on future investment decision-making research, and point out any possible gaps. Specifically, through this review, decision-makers would be able to choose the best-suited or hybrid methodology, according to different fields and objects, for investment viability and effectiveness. Finally, untapped issues recognized in recent research approaches are discussed along with suggestions for future research. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

91759726	9997	2022.1376	Local Community Knowledge for Flood Resilience: A Case Study from East Coast Malaysia	Malaysia as a tropical climate country is vulnerable to dreadful climate change events; particularly floods. These frequent occurrences of floods severely affect one or other parts of the country. In reducing disaster risk and strengthening local initiatives towards climate adaptation, vulnerable communities particularly in rural areas have developed valuable local knowledge for flood resilience. This local knowledge is continuously practiced in facing disasters and it is passed down to the next generations. This study aims to examine measures taken by communities based on local knowledge they possessed from the three stages of disaster management cycle namely, before, during and after disaster. Local knowledge as asserted by scholars could complement scientific knowledge and build a comprehensive disaster risk reduction approach for local context implementation. A mixed method approach was adopted; case study method and household survey involving 90 respondents for quantitative data collection and field observation for collecting qualitative data. Three case study areas in East Coast of Malaysia have been selected for further observation including; 1) Lubok Setol village in Kelantan state; 2) Teladas village in Terengganu state; and 3) Gajah Mati village in Pahang state. Findings from this study indicated that all study cases have developed and adopted local knowledge strategies for flood preparedness and responses including; 1) agriculture techniques and livestock trading; 2) stock piling of food and other necessities; 3) marking flood level as historical record; 4) floodproofing animal shelter; 5) constructing overhead storage cabinet and outdoor hut, and; 6) saving boats for emergencies. As a conclusion, it is proven that local community knowledge plays crucial roles in reducing disaster risks hence contributing towards building a resilient community. (C) 2022 Penerbit UTM Press.

The modeling results from two numerical simulation runs provide new insights on the formation of downwind vortex streets and the adjustment of coastal processes, such as upwelling and stratification. The distorted farm-induced wind deficits are calculated by the concept of single- and multiple-wake models. By assuming farm geometry as a large rigid rectangle, the numerical results of a shallow water model demonstrate the formation of vortex shedding wakes in the downwind of the wind farm. The slice model simulation runs, as the second numerical experiment, will address the coastal upwelling and geostrophic adjustment of density fronts in the presence of wind farm effects over a sloping bathymetry. We apply gravity wave effects using a wave-dependent aerodynamic roughness length when assuming the wind farm as an array of multiple turbines. Despite dynamical differences between simulation runs assuming farm as a rigid element and those considering farm as a cluster of single turbines, the results show some aspects of the farm-induced modulations on the pycnocline displacements and on the spatial-temporal evolution of the coastal upwelling. Although each simulation run has a unique scientific focus, the overall achieved numerical results are greatly able to improve the understanding of physical coupling between the wind farms and upper ocean dynamical processes.

In light of these impacts, the infrastructure enabling coastal tourism activities needs to be adapted. It is through the production of a space framework inspired by the work of Henri Lefebvre that we will reveal how a tourism space is socially constructing its own adaptation process. Using a case study methodology, we will examine the case of the Magdalen Island Archipelago in Quebec, Canada, and pinpoint the subcase of La Grave. The case study will show how tourism is adding value to land dynamics to justify major adaptation work on the shore in order to protect the capital accumulation capacities of the tourism space. These justifications are buttressed by discourses of heritage and economic impacts to validate proceeding with a form of spatial reordering that privileges certain spaces while potentially leaving out others.	climate change adaptation; tourism; production of space; quebec; canada	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91759732	263798	2015.2611	Comparison of marine macrophytes for their contributions to blue carbon sequestration	Many marine ecosystems have the capacity for long-term storage of organic carbon (C) in what are termed "blue carbon" systems. While blue carbon systems (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) are efficient at long-term sequestration of organic carbon (C), much of their sequestered C may originate from other (allochthonous) habitats. Macroalgae, due to their high rates of production, fragmentation, and ability to be transported, would also appear to be able to make a significant contribution as C donors to blue C habitats. In order to assess the stability of macroalgal tissues and their likely contribution to long-term pools of C, we applied thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to 14 taxa of marine macroalgae and coastal vascular plants. We assessed the structural complexity of multiple lineages of plant and tissue types with differing cell wall structures and found that decomposition dynamics varied significantly according to differences in cell wall structure and composition among taxonomic groups and tissue function (photosynthetic vs. attachment). Vascular plant tissues generally exhibited greater stability with a greater proportion of mass loss at temperatures >300Â°C (peak mass loss âˆ¼320Â°C) than macroalgae (peak mass loss between 175-300Â°C), consistent with the lignocellulose matrix of vascular plants. Greater variation in thermogravimetric signatures within and among macroalgal taxa, relative to vascular plants, was also consistent with the diversity of cell wall structure and composition among groups. Significant degradation above 600Â°C for some macroalgae, as well as some belowground seagrass tissues, is likely due to the presence of taxon-specific compounds. The results of this study highlight the importance of the lignocellulose matrix to the stability of vascular plant sources and the potentially significant role of refractory, taxon-specific compounds (carbonates, long-chain lipids, alginates, xylans, and sulfated polysaccharides) from macroalgae and seagrasses for their long-term sedimentary C storage. This study shows that marine macroalgae do contain refractory compounds and thus may be more valuable to long-term carbon sequestration than we previously have considered.

Fertilizing the central gyres would require enormous amounts of N and P fertilizer. Addition of iron to the Southern Ocean has been rejected as inefficient. The deep sea disposal of 50-100\% of fossil fuel CO2 would suppress the predicted transient peak of atmospheric CO2 but eventually the atmospheric CO2 level will be the same as without, unless rapid buffering by dissolution of calcite is significant. Ocean disposal applies only to point sources representing approximately 30\% of fossil fuel emissions; relocation of these plants to maritime regions may not be economical either. Also ocean disposal costs approximately 30-45\% of the energy produced. Current research is focusing on production and oceanic mixing behaviour of the effluent stream (this volume). In this paper the fate of the disposed CO2 is assessed. The various proposed forms appear chemically unstable relative to ambient seawater. However the higher CO2 contents of seawater might lead to part of the CO2 being buffered forever through enhanced dissolution of existing calcite deposits. The predicted impact depends on the selected rate constant of latter dissolution. Ocean dumping is a fallback option, in case the sensible options of energy conservation and shifting to other energy sources would not be implemented adequately. Latter options would require societal and economic adaptations but appear the most efficient, if not inevitable, policy for imminent reduction of CO2 emissions.

Decision makers need to recognize and adopt strategies to adapt to the potentially detrimental effects of SLR. Structured decision making (SDM) provides a rigorous framework for the management of natural resources. The aim of SDM is to identify decisions that are optimal with respect to management objectives and knowledge of the system. Most applications of SDM have assumed that the managed systems are governed by stationary processes. However, in the context of SLR it may be necessary to acknowledge that the processes underlying managed systems may be non-stationary, such that systems will be continuously changing. Therefore, SLR brings some unique considerations to the application of decision theory for natural resource management. In particular, SLR is expected to affect each of the components of SDM. For instance, management objectives may have to be reconsidered more frequently than under more stable conditions. The set of potential actions may also have to be adapted over time as conditions change. Models have to account for the non-stationarity of the modeled system processes. Each of the important sources of uncertainty in decision processes is expected to be exacerbated by SLR. We illustrate our ideas about adaptation of natural resource management to SLR by modeling a non-stationary system using a numerical example. We provide additional examples of an SDM approach for managing species that may be affected by SLR, with a focus on the endangered Florida manatee.

The rate of sea level rise (SLR) intensifies under the multiple effects of environmental and social pressure. A projected 2 m SLR, for example, would inundate 200 km(2) of land and impact the Sultanate's entire socioeconomic growth cycle and coastal ecology. The coastal land-use impacts, calculated through Landsat satellite images and census data, are used to explain the effect of SLR on coastal land uses and ecosystems. The Sultanate of Oman's comprehensive coastal zone management (CZM) planning and practices have limitations when seeking to reduce the burden on coastal system-linked socioeconomic growth and environmental issues. The study documented in this article addresses the challenges of the Sultanate's CZM practices and proposes an integrated coastal zone sustainability management framework.	coastal zone management; integrated framework; land uses; environmental stress; sea level rise	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91759755	5757	2013.307	Towards a social-ecological resilience framework for coastal planning	It is increasingly recognised that designing and implementing adaptive land management and development policies for the coastal zone requires an interdisciplinary and integrated approach. Yet, integrative thinking and action often remain problematic due to the competing interests and ambitions involved in coastal zone planning and management and the legacy of established development on the coast. This paper presents a developmental timeline to critically consider institutional responses to coastal development and seeks to locate contemporary challenges, such as climate change, in the context of a new environmental determinism. The argument is put forward that securing a shared understanding of development conditions and risks needs to be predicated on creating more robust conditions for interaction and fostering a sounder appreciation of the inter-dependencies of natural processes and governance. The concept of resilience is critically explored in order to consider a normative analytical framework for facilitating social learning and developing a reciprocal understanding of social-ecological dynamics that offers a spectrum of resilience options. This is illustrated in the context of coastal geomorphological processes and Process-Defined Management Units. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

91759762	97932	2021.7659	Numerical Study of Efficiency Indices to Evaluate the Effect of Layout Mode of Artificial Reef Unit on Flow Field	Artificial reefs (ARs) have been widely used to restore the seabed habitat and protect biodiversity. They can effectively increase the dissolved oxygen content in the bottom water layer by their disturbing effect of upwelling and downwelling. The bottom water is prone to hypoxia in summer due to the extreme weather of the global climate and excessive biomass in some marine ranching in northern China. Therefore, how to effectively use the upwelling effect of artificial reefs to alleviate this problem is a necessary subject of research. Generally, ARs are arranged by different intervals in a unit form on the seafloor, and the flow field effect is different from that of the individual reefs. However, few studies have been focused on the effect of layout mode on the flow field of a unit reef (UR). In this paper, we selected the interval between reefs (IR) and the angle of inflow (AI) as the influencing factors to study the flow field effect of UR. The upwelling and wake regions of 64 URs were presented by the efficiency and disturbance indices related to the flow characteristics and proposed an optimal layout mode having the best performance of the upwelling effect. The results showed that the interactions among the AI, the transverse, and longitudinal IRs were significant, and the AI has a significant influence on the flow field. These indices were effective and contribute to the layout optimization of UR. The AI close to 45 degrees has a significant influence on the flow field effect of UR.	unit reef; interval between reefs; angle of inflow; efficiency index; disturbance index	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91759764	13956	2021.1896	Social connectivity and adaptive capacity strategies in large-scale fisheries	Large-scale fisheries are important social-ecological systems that are increasingly being threatened by global climate change. Adaptive capacity is key for moving fisheries onto climate resilient pathways, however, implementing policies to improve adaptive capacity is challenging given the many diverse stakeholders involved in fisheries. Previous research suggests social networks are integral to adaptive capacity because social connectivity can enable, or constrain, knowledge and information sharing. We examine the network of communication among stakeholders in the Basque tropical tuna freezer purse seine fishery in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. We use cluster analysis, descriptive statistics, and exponential random graph models to assess whether different types of actors, occupying different network positions, value similar adaptive capacity strategies. The results indicate that many actor types are frequently connected within the fishery. Preferences for adaptive capacity strategies vary within and across actor types, and the preferences of highly central actors are generally more homogeneous and narrowly focused. All actors agree on the importance of the social organization domain from adaptive capacity, while fishing industry representatives tend to have the most holistic perspective on adaptive capacity overall. We discuss the implications of these findings as they relate to policies for supporting adaptive capacity and climate resilient fisheries.	adaptative capacity; global climate change; governance; social network analysis; tropical tunas	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Consequently, this study aimed to analyse the adaptive capacity and adaptation practices to climate change impacts of female headed households in the coastal communities of Lagonoy, Camarines Sur, Philippines. A quantitative method following causal-comparative and correlational research designs was employed in this study. Applying the multistage sampling technique, 162 out of 281female-headed households from the east and north coastal communities of Lagonoy comprised the study respondents. Results revealed that the female-headed households' capacities are moderately to highly adaptive as far as their economic and social resources are concerned. However, they are less to moderately adaptive in terms of their institutional and human resources. Further, the respondents have well strategised local adaptation practices or knowledge before, during and after the onslaught of natural calamities. This study also revealed a significant relationship between the respondents' adaptive capacity and adaptation practices from the two remote coastal communities. The adaptation practices during and after the onslaught of the natural disaster, educational attainment, and number of working household members are some of the factors that affect their adaptive capacity to climate change impacts. It is highly recommended that the national government, through the directive of policy makers, establish specific social protection programs by integrating the ecological and gender-sensitive framework.	adaptive capacity index; adaptation practices; female-headed households; single mother; women; lagonoy; camarines sur; philippines	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

To solve these issues, biofuels were emerged as effective alternatives to reduce pollution caused by the emission of greenhouse gases. Among biofuels, biobutanol is gaining attention as a feasible, renewable, cost-effective, alternative fuel. But the usages of conventional agricultural crops as feedstock are sensitive and controversial due to the growing concern over the availability of food worldwide. Microalgae are an excellent resource to overcome these challenges, which grows on both the sea and freshwater. Microalgae reducing their land usage with agriculture, and there is no food and fuel conflict exist. In addition, microalgae utilize inorganic carbon from the atmosphere for growth; hence they can reduce the emission levels as well as produce clean energy. Therefore, microalgae as third-generation feedstock came into practice due to their fast growth rate and higher carbohydrate content. The main focus of the present review is to discuss in detail about the major challenges faced as a feedstock, genetic engineering strategies adopted and future perspectives to improve the production of biobutanol from microalgae.

91759780	626	2017.43	Identification of limits and barriers to climate change adaptation: case study of two islands in Torres Strait, Australia	Communities living on remote islands are often viewed as among the most exposed and vulnerable to climate change impacts. This study uses the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to investigate how indigenous communities living on two physically different islands in Torres Strait, Australia, experience what they consider to be the impacts of climate change in relation to their daily lives. During this process, a series of natural, physical, and socio-cultural limits and barriers to climate change adaptation were identified on Boigu, a low-lying mud island inundated by the sea during high tides and storm surges. As a volcanic island, Erub's elevation is higher but significant community infrastructure, housing, and cultural sites are located on the low coastal fringe. No immediate limits to climate change adaptation were identified on Erub, but physical and socio-cultural barriers were revealed. Limits to climate change adaptation occur when adaptation actions fail to protect the things valued by those affected, or few adaptation options are available. Barriers to climate change adaptation may be overcome if recognised and addressed but can become entrenched limits if they are ignored. Within the participating communities, such limits and barriers included (a) restricted adaptation options due to limited access to particular livelihood assets; (b) difficulty engaging with government processes to secure external support; and (c) people's place-based values, which evoke a reluctance to relocate or retreat.	adaptation; barriers and limits; indigenous communities; place; sustainable livelihoods; torres strait<<\^{	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91759787	111	2022.19	An innovative climate adaptation planning process: iDEAL project	Climate change triggers increasing stresses on urban settlements and coastal areas. The intensification of climate-connected impacts requires municipalities and communities to undertake adaptation measures and plans. These interventions should be capable of reducing negative climatic effects on human habitat and regional bioregions. On the one hand, the international scientific community recognized the supported adaptation planning approach as the more suitable to cope with local needs and criticalities. On the other hand, there is a lack of practical guidelines and examples that can be used to implement the theory. From a perspective of growth of global awareness and sensitivity to the climatic emergency, it is necessary to develop a practical methodology able to link together impacts perception and public decision process at the local scale. The paper aims to fill the gap between the theoretical approach and the practice, through a replicable experience of integration among climate change adaptation concepts and decision-making processes. The proposed methodology is described in a 4-step process to support decision-makers in selecting tailored adaptation policies and measures. The article is based on the experience developed within the Interreg It-Hr project ``iDEAL - Decision support for Adaptation pLan{''} project. The research combines a quantitative and qualitative methodology in local participation processes. The approach is tested on five Mediterranean coastal cities and allowed to support the development of tailored adaptation measures. Furthermore, the interaction with local actors during the process led to an acceptance of the implemented measures, designing each measure to stakeholders' ambitions and expectations.	climate change; adaptation measures; adaptation plan; evaluation and decision process; participation	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762019	268108	2022.2654	Detecting Coastal Wetland Degradation by Combining Remote Sensing and Hydrologic Modeling	Sea-level rise and climate change stresses pose increasing threats to coastal wetlands that are vital to wildlife habitats, carbon sequestration, water supply, and other ecosystem services with global significance. However, existing studies are limited in individual sites, and large-scale mapping of coastal wetland degradation patterns over a long period is rare. Our study developed a new framework to detect spatial and temporal patterns of coastal wetland degradation by analyzing fine-scale, long-term remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. Then, this framework was tested to track the degradation of coastal wetlands at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (ARNWR) in North Carolina, United States, during the period from 1995 to 2019. We identified six types of coastal wetland degradation in the study area. Most of the detected degradation was located within 2 km from the shoreline and occurred in the past five years. Further, we used a state-of-the-art coastal hydrologic model, PIHM-Wetland, to investigate key hydrologic processes/variables that control the coastal wetland degradation. The temporal and spatial distributions of simulated coastal flooding and saltwater intrusion confirmed the location and timing of wetland degradation detected by remote sensing. The combined method also quantified the possible critical thresholds of water tables for wetland degradation. The remote sensingâ€“hydrologic model integrated scheme proposed in this study provides a new tool for detecting and understanding coastal wetland degradation mechanisms. Our study approach can also be extended to other coastal wetland regions to understand how climate change and sea-level rise impact wetland transformations. Â© 2022 by the authors.

Budai Salt Pan Wetland provides at least 11 ecosystem services, i.e. food provision, genetic materials, climate regulation, water purification and treatment, natural hazard regulation, pollination, spiritual and inspirational, recreational, aesthetic, educational and nutrient cycling. As the wetland is completely encompassed by dikes, there is no natural hydrological connectivity, and the wetland frequently dries out during the dry season due to lack of management and insufficient rainfall. In order to enhance wetland function, including habitat quality and ecosystem services, this study created a water management plan which mimics nature through water gate operation. We conducted experimental gate operations and evaluated the potential impacts on ecosystem services. The results show a positive impact on two of the ecosystem services, climate regulation and genetic materials, due to the increased moisture content and feeding bird individuals after gate operation. There was an insignificant change in the natural hazard regulation service as the gate operation tested in this study addressed issues of water supply rather than increasing detention space through draining. Through mimicking nature, sustainable water management techniques have the potential to enhance ecosystem services in wetlands.

91762026	6572	2020.809	A Prospective Study for the Mitigation of the Climate Change Effects: The Case of the North Aegean Region of Greece	One of the biggest challenges of our time is climate change. Every day, at different places of the world, the planet sends alarming messages about the enormous transformations it is experiencing due to human-based activities. The latter are responsible for changing weather patterns that threaten food production, energy production and energy consumption, the desertification of land, the displacement of people and animals because of food and water shortages due to the reductions in rainfall, natural disasters and rising sea levels. The effects of climate change affect us all, and if drastic measures are not considered in a timely manner, it will be more difficult and costly to adapt to the aforementioned effects in the future. Considering this context, the aim of this work is to implement a prospective study/structural analysis to the identified sectors of a regional plan of adaptation to climate change so as to promote the resilience of the region against the negative phenomena generated by the climate crisis. This was achieved in two steps: first, we identified the relationships between the strategic sectors of the plan and organized them in order of importance. Second, we assessed the effectiveness of several public policies oriented towards a city's resilience according to their impact upon the strategic sectors of the plan and the co-benefits generated by their implementation for society. The results highlight that the most essential sectors for the mitigation of climate change are flood risk management, built environment, forest ecosystem management, human health, tourism and rise in sea level. As a consequence, the most important measures for the resilience of the North Aegean Region against climate change are the ones related to the preparation of strategic master plans for flood protection projects.	climate change; resilience; structural analysis; prospective studies; north aegean region; micmac method; adaptation policies	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762033	13933	2022.1936	Climate change, seaports, and coastal management in Brazil: An overview of the policy framework	Seaports are exposed to a variety of coastal risks, particularly when considering the effects of climate change, due to their location in the land-sea interface. The vulnerability of seaports, besides the robustness and design of their infrastructures, is also directly related to their adaptive capacity. A policy framework plays an important role in facing the effects of climate change by virtue of planning and supporting the implementation of adaptive measures. This research aims to identify and evaluate the extent to which the climate change topic is addressed by the port planning, coastal management, and climate adaptation policies of Brazil. A policy review was carried out and the documents were evaluated based on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 13 (climate action) targets. A multiscale analysis was performed to identify how different management levels address the topic in their planning. The results suggest that although Brazil has effectively addressed the climate issue with its Adaptation National Plan, the coastal management framework and primarily port planning both remain uncertain. The existing coastal policies for climate adaptation purposes remain virtually not implemented, and accomplishments related to port adaptations are based only on a recent national sustainability guideline agenda. Although climate change impacts are perceived on a local scale, the Brazilian coastal ports and cities have not institutionalized efforts to taking climate-adaptive actions. This observed gap points out the necessity of policymakers to enhance the planning and application of adaptation measures at the local level, as well as promote the cooperation between multiscale sectoral agencies. This overview illustrates several opportunities to update, redesign, and innovate coastal and port management instruments to address climate-related issues. Nature-based Solutions would appear as a fundamental approach to be incorporated in multi-scale policy frameworks, which would support coastal ports and cities in their becoming climate-resilient, thus containing socio-economic losses and environmental deterioration.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted a study to evaluate community knowledge, awareness, perception severity, coping mechanism and adaptation to climate change in Ben Tre Province. Community members were aware of changing climatic conditions. About 90\% of respondents suffered losses from salt water intrusion. Households adopted coping mechanisms to deal with these changes. Age, education and previous affliction with climate change events influence knowledge, awareness, perception of severity and preparedness to manage climate change events. Local governments proposed adaptation strategies such as building of dikes to prevent salt water intrusion and developing of irrigation systems. Of the two adaptation strategies evaluated to losses from climate change, the sea dike system protected more land but the irrigating system was more cost effective in mitigating losses from climate change.	vietnam; climate; change; community; awareness; adaptation; mitigation; strategies; cost-effectiveness	2015	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762041	14047	2012.584	Towards a Legal Framework for Coastal Adaptation: Assessing the First Steps in Europe and Australia	In light of the urgent need for coastal adaptation policies and the impediments to their implementation, this article examines the early experience with coastal adaptation policies in the EU (in particular the Netherlands and the UK) and Australia, with a view to identifying the important features of an effective regulatory framework for coastal adaptation. We conclude that an integrated approach to coastal adaptation law is currently needed to lay the foundations for the required long-term strategy. Such an approach would establish processes by which adaptation objectives are agreed for each part of the coast, ensure land use planning that can accommodate future change and does not expose new communities to risk, integrate coastal adaptation with biodiversity and coastal zone policy, allocate regulatory responsibility in a way that promotes subsidiarity and consistency, and ensure that funds are available for future measures.	climate change; coastal adaptation; regulatory framework; sea level rise	2012	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

Using a risk and decision analysis methodology that is transferable to other vulnerable coastal cities of high strategic economic and political importance, we quantify sequences of adaptations that would be needed to protect London from flooding by the sea to the year 2300. Two critical adaptation thresholds are identified: (i) when mechanical pumping has to be provided alongside the moveable tidal barrier in order to drain the River Thames and (ii) when a permanently closed barrier with pumping to remove all of the river flow becomes the only viable means of avoiding flooding. We test the sensitivity of the costs and benefits of alternative adaptation pathways to a wide range of sea level rise trajectories. The adaptation pathway that most cost-effectively and robustly maintains risk at a tolerable level involves moving the Thames Barrier 17 km towards the sea if mean sea level rises 2 m above present levels. Our methodology provides a quantitative risk-based implementation of an adaptation pathway.	adaptation; sea level rise; flood risk; decision analysis; adaptation pathways; adaptation tipping points	2019	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762044	6028	2020.726	Perception of threats and related management measures: The case of 32 marine protected areas in West Africa	This paper presents the results of surveys conducted with managers of West African Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and focuses on the threats and the extent to which they are taken into account in the management process. The data and information derived from the surveys are used to provide a reference situation and to develop a complete inventory of threats faced by MPAs in the region. MPA managers identified unmanaged fisheries, coastal erosion, overexploitation of natural resources and pollution as the main threats to the sustainability of MPAs in the region. Climate change, although considered to be diffuse, is also a concern for managers. However, management measures are aimed (predominantly) at preventing overfishing and the overexploitation of terrestrial natural resources. Therefore, coastal erosion, pollution and climate change are only indirectly (and marginally) targeted by these management measures. Moreover, the management measures implemented i.e. monitoring, awareness raising and surveillance are insufficient and mainly aligned with the capacity of the local institutions. However, what is actually needed is more far reaching and adaptive actions to mitigate the current threats. The low financial, technical and human resources largely explain the limited scope of management actions taken. Coupled with the information and data deficit, which increases the inertia regarding threats that have been recurrent for more than a decade, management measures have not been sufficient in managing MPAs in the region. This paper recommends that the links between pressures on MPAs, technical recommendations and resulting management actions must be reinforced.	west africa; mpa; fishing; overexploitation; pollution; climate change	2020	Devi	AC	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
91762050	35608	2014.1827	Improved cost models for optimizing CO2 pipeline configuration for point-to-point pipelines and simple networks	In this study, a new cost model is developed for CO2 pipeline transport, which starts with the physical properties of CO2 transport and includes different kinds of steel grades and up-to-date material and construction costs. This pipeline cost model is used for a new developed tool to determine the configuration leading to the lowest levelized costs for CO2 transport, for point-to-point pipelines as well as for simple networks on different types of terrain and for different time frames. The model optimizes inlet pressure, diameter, steel grade and number of pumping stations. Results show that gaseous CO2 transport can give lower levelized costs than liquid CO2 transport for point-to-point pipelines and for simple networks, if the CO2 is stored in a reservoir with a low required injection pressure, like depleted natural gas fields. However, for storage fields with a required injection pressure of 8 MPa or higher (like aquifers), CO2 can be better transported in a liquid form. For onshore pipelines transporting liquid CO2, the optimal inlet pressure is 9-13 MPa and pumping stations are installed roughly every 50-100 km. For offshore pipelines, pumping stations are not an option and the inlet pressure is determined by the length of the pipeline. The maximum inlet pressure is about 25 MPa and for even longer pipelines, a larger diameter is selected. The levelized costs (excluding initial compression) for transporting 100 kg/s (about 3 Mt/y) over 100 km are between 1.8 and 33 (sic)/t for liquid and 4.0-6.4 (sic)/t for gaseous CO2 transport. For larger mass flows the costs are decreasing, for instance transporting 200 kg/s (about 6 Mt/y) over 100 km are 1.2-1.8 (sic)/t for liquid and 3.0-3.8 (sic)/t for gaseous CO2 transport. Furthermore, results show that higher steel grades lead to lower investment costs for onshore pipelines transporting liquid CO2. Using X120 in the long term reduces the pipeline costs up to 17\%. For gaseous CO2 transport, lower steel grades (like X42 and X52) are the best option. Also offshore pipelines do not benefit from the development of higher steel grades over time because the thickness should be at least 2.5\% of the outer diameter. The results indicate that oversizing the pipeline, to transport CO2 from an additional source that is coming available later, is not always cost-attractive. This strongly depends on the time span of which further CO2 sources are available and on the mass flows. Oversizing appears earlier cost-attractive compared to two point-to-point pipelines if the source with the largest mass flow becomes available first. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently a new approach has been proposed, where a long range lidar was employed to analyse the power spectral density of the line of sight wind component measured across the wake trajectory. The method is promising, but the number of useful time series within a measurement campaign depends to a large extent on a favourable geometrical setup of the lidar position and the wind direction. In the first part of the paper the approach is further investigated. To this avail, lidar simulations based on large eddy simulation results are analysed. In the second part, the approach is applied to real measurement data from a campaign with a long range lidar windscanner in the offshore wind farm alpha ventus. Eventually results about the wake dynamics are discussed.

91762060	267626	2022.5792	Increasing carbon, nutrient and trace metal accumulation driven by development in a mangrove estuary in south Asia	Mangrove forests sequester organic carbon, nutrients and toxic metals sorbed to fine sediment, and thus restrict the mobility of pollutants through estuarine environments. However, mangrove removal and environmental degradation caused by industrial activity and urban growth can impact the ability of mangrove communities to provide these critical ecosystem services. Here, we use sediment profiles from an impacted tropical estuary in southwest India to provide a c. 70-year record of carbon, nutrient and trace metal burial in the context of rapid urban development and the systemic removal of mangrove communities. Our results show that carbon and nutrient accumulation rates increase sharply during the 1990's in accordance with the high rates of deforestation. Nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation rates increased fourfold and twofold, respectively, during the same period. Organic carbon accumulation was fivefold higher than the global average during this period, reflecting intense deforestation during the last three decades. The enrichment of Hg, Zn, Pb, Mo, Ni, Cu and Mn demonstrate clear anthropogenic impact starting in the 1950's and peaking in 1990. Mercury, the trace metal with the highest enrichment factor, increased sevenfold in the most recent sediments due to increased fossil fuel emissions, untreated water and incineration of medical waste and/or fertilizers used in aquaculture. Organic carbon isotope (Î´13C) and C:N molar ratios indicate shifts to more terrestrial-derived source of organic matter in the most recent sediments reflecting growing deforestation of which may be prevalent in southeast Asia due to increasing development. This study emphasizes the critical role played by mangrove ecosystems in attenuating anthropogenically-derived pollutants, including carbon sequestration, and reveals the long-term consequences of mangrove deforestation in the context of rapidly developing economies.

Several case studies covering various European coastal areas are considered for illustration purposes. These include different nearshore areas, such as the Portuguese coast, Sardinia Island or a coastal sector close to the Danube Delta in the Black Sea. For the case studies related to the Portuguese coast, it is noted that a marine energy farm may reduce the velocity of the longshore currents, with a complete attenuation of the current velocity for some case studies in the coastal area from Leixoes region being observed. For the area located close to the Danube Delta, it is estimated that in the proposed configuration, a marine energy farm would provide an efficient protection against the wave action, but it will have a relatively negligible impact on the longshore currents. Summarizing the results, we can conclude that a marine energy farm seems to be beneficial for coastal protection, even in the case of the enclosed areas, such as the Mediterranean or Black seas, where the erosion generated by the wave action represents a real problem.	marine energy farms; shoreline impact; coastal protection; nearshore currents; different environments	2020	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

In this context, the development of renewable, carbon-neutral and economically feasible biofuels is a driving force for innovation worldwide. A lot of effort has been put into developing biodiesel from microalgae. However, there are still a number of technological, market and policy barriers that are serious obstacles to the economic feasibility and competitiveness of such biofuels. Conversely, there are also a number of business opportunities if the production of such alternative biofuel becomes part of a larger integrated system following the Biorefinery strategy. In this case, other biofuels and chemical products of high added value are produced, contributing to an overall enhancement of the economic viability of the whole integrated system. Additionally, dual purpose microalgae-bacteria-based systems for treating wastewater and production of biofuels and chemical products significantly contribute to a substantial saving in the overall cost of microalgae biomass production. These types of systems could help to improve the competitiveness of biodiesel production from microalgae, according to some recent Life Cycle Analysis studies. Furthermore, they do not compete for fresh water resources for agricultural purposes and add value to treating the wastewater itself. This work reviews the most recent and relevant information about these types of dual purpose systems. Several aspects related to the treatment of municipal and animal wastewater with simultaneous recovery of microalgae with potential for biodiesel production are discussed. The use of pre-treated waste or anaerobic effluents from digested waste as nutrient additives for weak wastewater is reviewed. Isolation and screening of microalgae/cyanobacteria or their consortia from various wastewater streams, and studies related to population dynamics in mixed cultures, are highlighted as very relevant fields of research. The species selection may depend on various factors, such as the biomass and lipid productivity of each strain, the characteristics of the wastewater, the original habitat of the strain and the climatic conditions in the treatment plant, among others. Some alternative technologies aimed at harvesting biomass at a low cost, such as cell immobilization, biofilm formation, flocculation and bio-flocculation, are also reviewed. Finally, a Biorefinery design is presented that integrates the treatment of municipal wastewater with the recovery of oleaginous microalgae, together with the use of seawater supplemented with anaerobically digested piggery waste for cultivating Arthrospira (Spirulina) and producing biogas, biodiesel, hydrogen and other high added value products. Such strategies offer new opportunities for the cost-effective and competitive production of biofuels along with valuable non-fuel products.

It is argued that these processes serve as substitutes for scarce financial and human capital in poor communities. To date, the majority of studies on social capital in the Global South has framed these processes in place-based ways, assuming that they are developed and deployed within local spaces. However, in an increasingly globalized world, people's social networks increasingly transcend the local, and social capital is therefore manifested in multi-scalar geographies. The aim of this study is to assess the significance of this translocality for the use of social capital in responding to natural hazards. Using evidence from communities under threat of sea-water inundation in rural and urban areas in North Java, we focus on both the outcomes of translocal social capital for hazard adaptation and the origins of these social ties. Our results show that households with a higher number of translocal contacts are more likely to take proactive measures against flooding and subsidence. Furthermore, we found that the conditions for establishing translocal social capital differ between rural and urban areas, and we show that the propensity for translocal social capital is stratified along economic lines. Poorer households have fewer translocal social ties, which impairs their ability to adapt to environmental threats. Thus, our results contest former assumptions about (translocal) social capital being a prime resource for the poor. The paper concludes that interventions in poor communities designed to enhance translocal social capital may offer answers to this problem.	translocality; social capital; adaptation; sea level rise; jakarta; semarang	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762078	391672	2021.21747	A review: saltwater intrusion in North Africa's coastal areas-current state and future challenges	North Africa coastline extends on 8955 km from Mauritania to Egypt. These areas continue to experience population and economic growth. North Africa coastal aquifers were exposed to an increase in groundwater salinity and seawater intrusion, which may contribute to economic crisis as a result of freshwater resources crisis. This work aims to explore the status and a holistic comprehending review of saltwater intrusion extent in the region and future challenges. Results on seawater intrusion in North Africa, from published papers and grey literature, show a several efforts have been made in understanding this phenomenon and developing management strategies in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania. The most method used is geochemical data and statistical analysis. Some studies linked geochemical data with geophysical techniques, geographical information system (GIS), and GALDIT index. Seawater intrusion varies from one country to another according to the aquifer hydrogeological settings, abstraction rates and aquifer morphology, climate change, urban expansion, and economic development. North Africa countries, such as Libya and Mauritania, need, for instance, more expertise and experience on the part of local researchers. The challenge of inadequate data and a need for a more robust data inventory was stressed. This paper recommends developing and building scientific capabilities in regional and international partnerships, and adopting rational water governance for sustainable development.

91762079	320785	2018.14710	A Robust Distance Protection Approach for Bulk AC Power System Considering the Effects of HVDC Interfaced Offshore Wind Units	Offshore wind generators are connected to the ac power grid through high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems. However, when a short-circuit fault occurs in a transmission line, which is connected to the point of common coupling (PCC) of the HVDC system, the performance of distance relays on the ac grid is affected. This is due to rapid response of reactive power control of the grid-side voltage source converter (GVSC) of the HVDC system to compensate the voltage drop of the PCC bus. In other words, during the fault, the GVSC injects the reactive power to the ac grid to restore the PCC bus voltage. This in turn causes to interfere with the distance protection scheme by affecting the viewed impedance of distance relays. To overcome this problem, based on robust control theory, the present paper introduces a robust control approach for voltage source converter of HVDC system using Î¼ synthesis analysis. The proposed strategy controls the reactive power injected to the PCC bus by trying to keep the defined current ratio $\alpha $ constant. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was validated through simulation using MATLAB/Simulink.

91762086	232484	2022.19358	Power System Design Optimization for a Ferry Using Hybrid-Shaft Generators	Ferry contributing a significant amount of greenhouse gas is one of the critical vessels to be electrified. Designing a power system for a ferry with hybrid-shaft generators is different from designing a power system for other vessels because of its fixed route. More clearly, ferries repeatedly travel between their port of origin and port of destination, and before the next voyage, the battery must be recharged to the initial state so that the optimal energy management scheme can be repeatedly applied. Furthermore, the flexibility of hybrid-shaft generators, which allow more fuel saving, increases design complexity. In this paper, a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem is first formulated, and a power management algorithm with an initialization step for fulfilling the battery recharging requirement and a refinement step for minimizing the fuel consumption is proposed. The simulation results obtained from data of an actual ferry show that the proposed power management algorithm can fully recharge the battery and consumes less fuel than a rule-based power management scheme. Simulations also reveal that fuel consumption depends on available shore power, highlighting the necessity to develop charging infrastructure for practical electrification. Because of its speed, the algorithm can support hardware sizing, e.g., battery sizing.	batteries; engines; generators; power systems; power system management; industries; fuels; marine vehicles; power systems; energy storage; optimization methods; marine vehicle propulsion; generators	2022	Devi	AC	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762087	8885	2019.955	Coastal adaptation through urban land reclamation: Exploring the distributional effects	Land reclamation and urban redevelopment is currently underway in coastal regions around the world, as urbanization continues rapidly, and high-value coastal urban land becomes more scarce. Yet coastal hazards will also continue to increase due to sea-level rise, and building flood risk reduction measures into such land reclamation projects appears to be low cost compared to the potential benefits generated. Moreover, land reclamation in high-value urban areas that incorporates such adaptation can generate substantial revenue attractive to governments, particularly in developing countries, which struggle to finance coastal adaptation measures. Yet revenue generation in these projects depends on including some degree of high-value and high-priced developments, giving rise to potential distributional effects. This paper surveys three current coastal urban redevelopment projects incorporating flood risk reduction in the Maldives, Germany and Nigeria, illustrating different modes of urban development projects and the distributional effects that can arise for each of these. The paper explores the equity implications of such projects that arise in planning processes and in implementation. The examples illustrate that inequalities can arise through incentives for corruption, budget imperatives leading to developments that result in gentrification, and shifting of physical risks on to neighboring communities. Finally, I reflect on policy and project design instruments that can address these inequalities, and draw out implications for future research to ensure sustainable and inclusive development of coastal cities in the context of sea-level rise.	adaptation; urbanisation; public finance; inequality; coasts	2019	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762094	9170	2012.410	Rhetoric or action: Are South African municipalities planning for climate change?	In 2008 the South African National Disaster Management Centre commissioned a study into measures taken by local municipalities to plan for climate change. Two areas were selected for their dissimilar climatic challenges: the //Khara Hais Municipality,(1) a semi-desert area in the Northern Cape Province plagued by droughts and severe weather events, and the George Municipality, an area in the Western Cape Province plagued by droughts, the rising sea level and flash floods. It was found that despite South African laws and regulations requiring local government to take action to reduce the risk of disasters, planning for climate change is still no more than sophisticated rhetoric in the two municipalities. This lack of urgency can be ascribed to local municipalities having other more pressing developmental priorities. It would, however, be short-sighted of municipalities not to plan for climate change, as major setbacks in hard-won economic and social development follow a disaster.	climate change adaptation; climate change mitigation; disaster risk reduction; local government	2012	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

Without any prevention efforts, Weriagar land might be disappear due to erosion on coastal and riverside. The Shore Housing Improvement Program was developed in 2014 to improve the environment, housing and settlement in Weriagar District. Based on the preliminary site observation and further site survey, the program continued in conducting in-depth analysis consists of house assessment method prior to concept select matrix development, in which design criteria were obtained. The results from analysis phase shows that it is necessary to design a house and settlement that can fulfil the needs of indigenous people, both functionally and aesthetically. Functionally, the house is designed to provide spaces for both private and public needs of the family. It can be used either as a family private space or as a public gathering space between family and their neighbours. Aesthetically, houses' architectural form is designed to identify the locality of Weriagar District. The houses' design feature highlighted in using local material, rainwater harvesting system, high pitched roof feature as a response to hot-humid climate and elevated-floor feature as response to tidal condition in estuary area.	estuary settlement; settlement development; housing design; design criteria; weriagar district; bintuni bay	2018	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762099	9450	2021.1277	Eco-Engineering of Seawalls-An Opportunity for Enhanced Climate Resilience From Increased Topographic Complexity	In the context of ``green{''} approaches to coastal engineering, the term ``eco-engineering{''} has emerged in recent years to describe the incorporation of ecological concepts (including artificially water-filled depressions and surface textured tiles on seawalls and drilled holes in sea structures) into the conventional design process for marine infrastructures. Limited studies have evaluated the potential increase in wave energy dissipation resulting from the increased hydraulic roughness of ecologically modified sea defences which could reduce wave overtopping and consequent coastal flood risks, while increasing biodiversity. This paper presents results of small-scale laboratory investigations of wave overtopping on artificially roughened seawalls. Impulsive and non-impulsive wave conditions with two deep-water wave steepness values (=0.015 and 0.06) are evaluated to simulate both swell and storm conditions in a twodimensional wave flume with an impermeable 1:20 foreshore slope. Measurements from a plain vertical seawall are taken as the reference case. The seawall was subsequently modified to include 10 further test configurations where hydraulic effects, reflective of ``eco-engineering{''} interventions, were simulated by progressively increasing seawall roughness with surface protrusions across three length scales and three surface densities. Measurements at the plain vertical seawall compared favorably to empirical predictions from the EurOtop II Design Manual and served as a validation of the experimental approach. Results from physical model experiments showed that increasing the length and/or density of surface protrusions reduced overtopping on seawalls. Benchmarking of test results from experiments with modified seawalls to reference conditions showed that the mean overtopping rate was reduced by up to 100\% (test case where protrusion density and length were maximum) under impulsive wave conditions. Results of this study highlight the potential for eco-engineering interventions on seawalls to mitigate extreme wave overtopping hazards by dissipating additional wave energy through increased surface roughness on the structure.	climate change; coastal resilience; eco-engineering; ecologically enhanced seawall; vertical breakwaters; wave overtopping; coastal flooding	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91762100	2553	2022.359	Supporting habitat restoration in the northern Gulf of Mexico through synthesis of data on multiple and interacting benefits and stressors	Outcomes of landscape scale restoration and conservation can be maximized when planning is based upon quantitative and decision-relevant information. Existing tools to support data-driven planning are hindered by regionally inconsistent information and a need for advanced methods to analyze data of varying spatial resolution and coverage. We present a synthesis methodology for region-wide derived metrics to characterize natural resource value, ecosystem stress, and social vulnerability to inform implementation of conservation and restoration projects. Our three-part methodology was developed and tested for the Gulf of Mexico in support of the Southeast Conservation Blueprint that was created to advance the Southeast Conservation and Adaptation Strategy. The first step included integration of prioritized natural resource metrics alongside socio-ecological metrics to create a data layer of synthesized natural resource priority across the northern Gulf of Mexico. The second component was calculation of ecosystem stress indices based on ecologically relevant thresholds and a cumulative ecosystem stress layer, in addition to analyzing correlations between individual stressors and their relative importance. The final component was development of a social vulnerability (SoVI) index. Analysis of these metrics illustrate their ability to effectively capture variability at multiple scales in the Gulf of Mexico, including expected spatial correlation of stressors such as road density and non-point source pollution in populated areas and the dominance of sea-level rise as a future stressor along the coast. Significant composite components of social vulnerability for the northern Gulf of Mexico region were identified and include economic status, professional workforce, elderly population, population stability, migrant workforce, and rural population. To demonstrate the utility of the data synthesis approach, we used the developed data layers to evaluate proposed marsh creation projects in southern Louisiana. The synthesized data layers were capable of distinguishing differences at the scale of individual habitat restoration projects, and high-value projects could be aligned with the goals of key funding streams. This pilot application illustrates how restoration programs could use the methodology developed here to maximize benefits from conservation and restoration actions along the northern Gulf of Mexico or other regions globally.	coastal restoration; ecosystem services; natural resource value; ecosystem stress; social vulnerability	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762102	234300	2016.5168	Climigration? Population and climate change in Arctic Alaska	Residents of towns and villages in Arctic Alaska live on ``the front line of climate change.{''} Some communities face immediate threats from erosion and flooding associated with thawing permafrost, increasing river flows, and reduced sea ice protection of shorelines. The term climigration, referring to migration caused by climate change, originally was coined for these places. Although initial applications emphasized the need for government relocation policies, it has elsewhere been applied more broadly to encompass unplanned migration as well. Some historical movements have been attributed to climate change, but closer study tends to find multiple causes, making it difficult to quantify the climate contribution. Clearer attribution might come from comparisons of migration rates among places that are similar in most respects, apart from known climatic impacts. We apply this approach using annual 1990-2014 time series on 43 Arctic Alaska towns and villages. Within-community time plots show no indication of enhanced out-migration from the most at-risk communities. More formally, there is no significant difference between net migration rates of at-risk and other places, testing several alternative classifications. Although climigration is not detectable to date, growing risks make either planned or unplanned movements unavoidable in the near future.	climate; migration; climigration; alaska; arctic; erosion	2016	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

The study provided relevant references for coastal exploitation, land management and related researches in other countries and regions. Materials and methods Measured soil attributes include physical indicators {[}bulk density (rho(b)), total porosity (f(t)) and water-holding capacity (WHC)], chemical indicators {[}pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total nitrogen (TN), soil organic matter (SOM), available N, available P and available K] and biological indicators (urease activity, catalase activity and phosphatase activity), and 60 soil samples were collected within five land use types {[}(1) intertidal soils, (2) reclaimed tidal flat soils, (3) farmland soils, (4) suburban vegetable soils, (5) industrial area soils) in Jianggang village of Dongtai county, Jiangsu province of China. Results and discussion The results from the investigation indicated that selected soil properties reduced to three factors for 0-20-cm soil depth; ``Soil fertility status{''} (factor 1), ``Soil physical status{''} (factor 2) and ``Soil salinity status{''} (factor 3). For the first factor, the measured soil attributes with higher loadings were TN and SOM, which represented soil fertility feature, and for the second and third factors, the measured soil attributes with higher loadings were rho(b) and available K as well as EC, which reflected soil physical properties and soil salinity feature, respectively. Conclusions Changes in different land use types due to plants (corn, wheat and green vegetable) and application of fertilizers were characterized by promoted soil quality, including improvements in chemical properties (increasing SOM concentration, TN and nutrient available to plants; decreasing EC), improvements in soil physical properties (decreasing rho(b); increasing f(t) and WHC) and enhancements in soil enzyme activities. Judging from the soil quality indices, the soil quality was affected by different land use practices and decreased in sequence of suburban vegetable soils, farmland soils, industrial area soils, reclaimed tidal flat soils and intertidal soils in the study area.	coastal tidal lands; factoranalysis; soilquality; soil quality index	2013	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

91762115	337557	2015.6729	Resonant overvoltage assessment in offshore wind farms via a parametric black-box wind turbine transformer model	The protection of offshore wind farms (OWFs) against overvoltages, especially resonant overvoltage, is of paramount importance because of poor accessibility and high repair costs. In this paper, we study how switching overvoltages at the wind turbine transformer (WTT) medium voltage (MV) side can lead to high overvoltages on the low voltage (LV) side. The effect of overvoltage protective devices is analyzed. A detailed model of an OWF row is developed in electromagnetic transients program-alternative transients program (EMTP-ATP), including interconnecting cables, WTT, surge arresters and resistive-capacitive filters. A parameterized black-box WTT model is obtained from measurements and is used for investigating the transfer of resonant overvoltages from the MV to the LV side. The model is capable of shifting systematically the frequencies and adjusting the transformer input impedance. Simulation results show that wind turbine energization in an OWF can lead to overvoltages on the LV terminals. The rate of rise of overvoltages (du/dt) is in the range of 300-500 pu/Î¼s. It is found that resistive-capacitive filters should be installed on both MV and LV terminals of WTTs to decrease both resonant overvoltages and du/dt, which is unachievable by surge arrester alone.

91762116	11704	2020.1434	How do we overcome abrupt degradation of marine ecosystems and meet the challenge of heat waves and climate extremes?	Extreme heat wave events are now causing ecosystem degradation across marine ecosystems. The consequences of this heat-induced damage range from the rapid loss of habitat-forming organisms, through to a reduction in the services that ecosystems support, and ultimately to impacts on human health and society. How we tackle the sudden emergence of ecosystem-wide degradation has not yet been addressed in the context of marine heat waves. An examination of recent marine heat waves from around Australia points to the potential important role that respite or refuge from environmental extremes can play in enabling organismal survival. However, most ecological interventions are being devised with a target of mid to late-century implementation, at which time many of the ecosystems, that the interventions are targeted towards, will have already undergone repeated and widespread heat wave induced degradation. Here, our assessment of the merits of proposed ecological interventions, across a spectrum of approaches, to counter marine environmental extremes, reveals a lack preparedness to counter the effects of extreme conditions on marine ecosystems. The ecological influence of these extremes are projected to continue to impact marine ecosystems in the coming years, long before these interventions can be developed. Our assessment reveals that approaches which are technologically ready and likely to be socially acceptable are locally deployable only, whereas those which are scalable-for example to features as large as major reef systems-are not close to being testable, and are unlikely to obtain social licence for deployment. Knowledge of the environmental timescales for survival of extremes, via respite or refuge, inferred from field observations will help test such intervention tools. The growing frequency of extreme events such as marine heat waves increases the urgency to consider mitigation and intervention tools that support organismal and ecosystem survival in the immediate future, while global climate mitigation and/or intervention are formulated.	ecosystem intervention; heat wave; marine; marine degradation; temperature stress	2020	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

In this context, special attention has been given to the western European coasts that are facing the ocean. In order to do this, the reanalysis data coming from three state-of-the-art databases (ERA Interim, ERA20C, and NCEP) were processed. Furthermore, a more complete picture was provided by also including the satellite measurements coming from the AVISO (Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic Data) project in the analysis. From this perspective, the distribution of the two marine energy resources was discussed, which throughout energetic mapsand further, on some specific reference siteswere defined at a distance of 50 km from the shore for more detailed analysis and comparison. As expected, the places located in the vicinity of the United Kingdom present more important energy resources, but some other interesting sites were also highlighted. Furthermore, although each dataset is defined by particular features, there is a similar pattern in the identification of the sites' attractiveness, regardless of the database considered for assessment.	european nearshore; coastal areas; wind and wave power; reanalysis data; satellite measurements	2018	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91762128	14737	2019.1526	ANALYSIS OF THE ABILITY OF MANGROVE SEQUESTRATION AND CARBON STOCK IN PEJARAKAN VILLAGE, BULELENG REGENCY, BALI	Mangroves have a major role as carbon absorption and stock. However, this potential cannot be maximized, due to the high level of mangrove damage. The research question is the extent of the ability of mangroves to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) and store it in the form of biomass. The purpose of this study was to determine the absorption ability and carbon stock of various types of mangove. The research location was chosen in Pejarakan village, Buleleng Regency, Bali Province, Indonesia as a case study. The method used is non-destructive to obtain diameter data at the height of mangrove trees, by collecting garbage and sediment samples manually on the floor of mangrove forests and to motivate the Government and local communities to restore mangrove forests. The results showed that the high density types of Sonneratia alba turned out to have the ability to absorb and store carbon, compared to other mangrove species. The results showed that S. alba is estimated to have the ability to absorb 57.60 tons of CO2 ha(-1) which is equivalent to 15.71 tons C ha(-1). While the lowest value is the Osbornia octodonta with the lowest density value. S. alba's ability to store carbon is 5.56 tons of CO2 ha(-1) or equivalent to 1.52 tons C ha(-1). The conclusion is that S. alba has the highest ability to absorb and store carbon.	carbon; mangrove forest; sonneratia alba	2019	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Previous carbon studies regarding biological invasion in coastal wetlands mainly focused on soil organic carbon; however, little is known about the mechanisms that control soil inorganic carbon (SIC, e.g., carbonates) variation. In order to explore our understanding, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate controlling mechanisms of SIC in response to Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) invasion in the east-central China coast, where there is a lack of native salt marsh species. A space-for-time substitution method was used to identify sampling sites, assuming it has the capability to quantify the soil-vegetation relationship along a gradient of the increasing S. alterniflora age (17 year). The results showed that soil inorganic carbon density (SICD) at the 0.3-0.6 m depth exhibited a decline under S. alterniflora invasion, while there was no substantial change at the depths of 0-0.3 m and 0.6-1 m. The majority of the variances in SICD changes could be explained by S. alterniflora invasion and key soil physicochemical variables. In SEM, S. alterniflora invasion, soil water content, and soil texture presented direct influence on SICD throughout the soil profile (i.e., to 1 m depth). Soil salinity presented direct influence on SICD in the upper 0.6 m soil, while pH played an important role in the depth of 0.6-1 m. These results highlight that dynamics of SIC processes are probably controlled by interactions among S. alterniflora invasion and key soil physicochemical variables.

91762139	108	2021.6	Uncovering Engagement Networks for Adaptation in Three Regional Communities: Empirical Examples from New South Wales, Australia	Climate change is a significant challenge for policy makers, planners and communities. While adaptation responses are generally recognised to be place-based, policy processes on adaptation often reside with central (state or national) governments that may be remote from regional communities. In this paper, we contribute to the literature regarding how diverse regional communities engage with planning and policy for climate adaptation, which is important for successful implementation. We adopt a social network analysis (SNA) approach that enables an exploration of the interaction of community networks with policy information. There are limited empirical studies of information sharing about climate adaptation policy through community knowledge networks. One previous study, located in coastal New South Wales, Australia, mapped the community's knowledge acquisition and diffusion to reveal the underlying network structures that influenced policy engagement pathways. However, further studies are needed to determine how the features of community networks may change with local context (e.g., coastal versus inland). This paper extends previous studies to compare and contrast adaptation knowledge networks in three NSW communities: Shoalhaven (the original coastal study site), Bega (coastal) and Orange (inland). Findings suggest that the presence of a natural resource-dependent industry, local geographies and boundary spanners acting as network knowledge brokers are factors influencing community knowledge flows. The work further demonstrates the utility of SNA to measure knowledge networks that can inform government engagement and communication with communities on climate adaptation policy.	adaptation policy; climate change policies; community participation; knowledge networks; environmental governance; social network analysis	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762142	237563	2013.6324	Linking prawn and shrimp farming towards a green economy in Bangladesh: Confronting climate change	The coastal aquaculture sector in Bangladesh is dominated by export-oriented freshwater prawn and brackishwater shrimp farming, both are commercially known as ``white gold{''} because of transnational value. This article reviews prawn and shrimp farming in coastal Bangladesh that have been linked to a ``green economy{''}. As part of agricultural development in coastal Bangladesh, prawn and shrimp farming were initiated in the 1970s. Over the last three decades, prawn and shrimp culture have undergone a revolutionary development in coastal Bangladesh. Pawn and shrimp farming have brought about widespread social and economic benefits. However, a wide range of environmental issues including climate change have recently been identified to threaten the sustainability of coastal aquaculture. In order to achieve a green economy, environmental challenges must be addressed in translating its benefits effectively to the millions of coastal poor. Considering the extreme vulnerability to the effects of climate change, an integrated green economy system needs to be introduced to cope with the challenges. Effective planning in respect to coastal zone management would also be given particular attention. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

91762151	27687	2021.3041	Combined Abundance of All Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem Indicator Taxa Inadequate as Sole Determiner of Vulnerability, Antarctic Peninsula	In order to achieve conservation objectives and preserve the biodiversity of the Southern Ocean, a variety of ecosystems must be protected. This holds especially true for the benthic communities of this region that are characteristically mosaic in their spatial distributions. As such, disparate communities cannot be comprehensively assessed by a single blanket methodology. Herein, evidence appropriate to the diverse characteristics of the communities encountered during a submarine expedition demonstrates the particular vulnerability of four sites that exemplify VMEs as defined by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and the UN's Fisheries and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Three sites are identified as VMEs based on highly significant abundances of indicator taxa. A fourth is identified based on a high density of cold-water coral taxa, many of which were not observed in abundance at the sites that were triggered as vulnerable by a significantly high abundance of all indicator taxa. The VME at this latter site was richly diverse in coral taxa, many of which are considered particularly vulnerable to climate change, as well as critical for their potential for genuine blue carbon sequestration. As of November, 2018, all four sites are now registered with CCAMLR as VMEs and thus, are afforded protection from all bottom fishing activities. However, if consideration isn't given to the composition and/or diversity of VME indicator taxa present, in addition to overall abundance/density, some of the most vulnerable communities are left at risk. A blanket threshold for all VME taxa adhered to in fisheries management of the Southern Ocean, and other high seas areas, is grossly insufficient. Without taking a more precautionary approach to identifying and protecting VMEs, CCAMLR will not be able to meet its conservation objectives and may even be putting Antarctic fisheries at risk.	vme; vulnerable marine ecosystems; cold-water corals; density; abundance thresholds; antarctica; ccamlr; submarine; indicator taxa	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762154	387557	2021.7675	Evaluation of Wave Energy Location by Using an Integrated MCDM Approach	In recent years, sudden global energy demand has led to the gradual exhaustion of fossil fuel, the worldâ€™s main energy resource. With the negative impact of fossil fuel on the environment, governments and organizations have increased R&D funding on renewable energy resources such as solar and wave energy. Vietnam has a great potential for developing wave energy projects owing to the presence of a long coastline and vast ocean. Choosing an optimal location for wave-based power plant projects is a multicriteria decision that requires understanding the quantitative and qualitative elements for assessing the balance of factors when trying to reach the most accurate result. This study proposes a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model, fuzzy-analytic hierarchical process (FAHP), and weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) in evaluating potential wave energy stations at the Vietnamese coastline. The authors identify all criteria and sub-criteria affecting the wave power plant location selection process through literature review and expert interview. Selection criteria include wave height, the distance between two waves, number of waves, wind speed, wind duration, ocean depth, turbulence, water quality, coastal erosion, shipping density, protection laws, labor resources, safety conditions, and other related factors. FAHP was used to determining the weights of the identified criteria in the first stage of this study. Finally, the WASPAS model was employed to rank all the alternatives involved in making an effective decision. This study aimed to develop a tool to enhance decision-making when solving fuzzy multi-criteria problems. We propose a real-world model for the effectiveness of the proposed model.

The vulnerability assessment of coastal areas, in relation to climate change, is a key topic of worldwide increasing interest. The integration of methodologies supported by Remote Sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and in situ monitoring has allowed a viable identification of vulnerable areas to erosion. In the present study, a model was proposed to the assessment of the estuarine system of Cananeia-Iguape (Brazil), by applying the evaluation and prediction of vulnerability models for the conservation and preservation of mangroves. Approximately 1221 Km(2) were classified, with 16\% of the total presenting high and very high vulnerability to erosion. Other relevant aspects, were the identification and georeferencing sites that showed strong evidence of erosion and, thus, having a huge influence on the final vulnerability scores. The obtained results led to the development of a multidisciplinary approach through the application of a prediction and description model that resulted from the adaptation of the study system from a set of implemented models for coastal regions, in order to contribute to the erosion vulnerability assessment in the mangroves ecosystems (and associated localities, municipalities and communities).	remote sensing; coastal erosion; mangroves; geographical information systems; coastal vulnerability index	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Responses to climate-driven shifts in a fishery may be constrained by existing management or institutional arrangements and technological settings. In order to understand how fisheries are responding to ocean warming, we investigate purse seine fleets targeting tropical tunas in the east Atlantic Ocean using effort and sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) data from 1991 to 2017. An analysis of the spatial change in effort using a centre of gravity approach and empirical orthogonal functions is used to assess the spatiotemporal changes in effort anomalies and investigate links to SSTA. Both analyses indicate that effort shifts southward from the equator, while no clear pattern is seen northward from the equator. Random forest models show that while technology and institutional settings better explain total effort, SSTA is playing a role when explaining the spatiotemporal changes of effort, together with management and international agreements. These results show the potential of management to minimize the impacts of climate change on fisheries activity. Our results provide guidance for improved understanding about how climate, management and governance interact in tropical tuna fisheries, with methods that are replicable and transferable. Future actions should take into account all these elements in order to plan successful adaptation.	bilateral agreements; effort; fisheries management; ocean warming; technology	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

The energy saving potential of the proposed solution is analyzed through a multibody system simulation. The self-contained system demonstrates superior energy efficiency compared to the benchmark system representing the state-of-the-art approach used today (i.e., valve-controlled cylinders by means of pressure-compensated directional control valves and counter-balance valves, supplied by a centralized hydraulic power unit). Due to theâ€power on demandâ€ capability, the cancellation of the throttling losses, and the opportunity to recover energy in motoring quadrants, the self-contained system consumes 83.44% less energy without affecting the systemâ€™s performance.

There has been increased interest from important stakeholders regarding deep decarbonization, evidenced by market surveys conducted by Shell and Deloitte. However, deep decarbonization will require financial incentives and policies at an international and regional level given the maritime sector's similar to 3\% contribution to green house gas (GHG) emissions. The review paper, based on research articles and grey literature, discusses technoeconomic problems and/or benefits for technologies that will help the shipping sector achieve the IMO's targets. The review presents a discussion on the recent literature regarding alternative fuels (nuclear, hydrogen, ammonia, methanol), renewable energy sources (biofuels, wind, solar), the maturity of technologies (fuel cells, internal combustion engines) as well as technical and operational strategies to reduce fuel consumption for new and existing ships (slow steaming, cleaning and coating, waste heat recovery, hull and propeller design). The IMO's 2050 targets will be achieved via radical technology shift together with the aid of social pressure, financial incentives, regulatory and legislative reforms at the local, regional and international level.	decarbonization; hydrogen; ammonia; biofuels; fuel consumption; slow steaming	2021	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762171	317388	2019.14179	Validation of Improved Sampling Concepts for Offshore Wind Turbine Fatigue Design	Fatigue damage is a design-driving phenomenon for substructures of offshore wind turbines. However, fatigue design based on numerical simulations is quite uncertain. One main reason for this uncertainty is scattering offshore conditions combined with a limited number of simulations (samples). According to current standards, environmental conditions are sampled using a deterministic grid of the most important environmental conditions (e.g., wind speed and direction, significant wave height, and wave period). Recently, there has been some effort to reduce the inherent uncertainty of damage calculations due to limited data by applying other sampling concepts. Still, the investigation of this uncertainty and of methods to reduce it is a subject of ongoing research. In this work, two improved sampling conceptsâ€”previously proposed by the authors and reducing the uncertainty due to limited samplingâ€”are validated. The use of strain measurement data enables a realistic estimate of the inherent uncertainty due to limited samples, as numerical effects, etc., are excluded. Furthermore, an extensive data set of three years of data of two turbines of the Belgian wind farm Northwind is available. It is demonstrated that two previously developed sampling methods are generally valid. For a broad range of model types (i.e., input dimensions as well as degrees of non-linearity), they outperform standard sampling concepts such as deterministic grid sampling or Monte Carlo sampling. Hence, they can reduce the uncertainty while keeping the sampling effort constant, or vice versa.

In 1996, Hurricane Fran, two months after Hurricane Bertha, inflicted an estimated \$7 billion in public and private damage, including 40, 000 homes destroyed, 115,000 buildings damaged, and 25 lives lost. Post-storm rebuilding of the North Carolina coastal zone is governed by a complex array of federal, state, and local laws, of which the keystone is the state Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA). This act, as augmented by the National Flood Insurance Program and the federal Coastal Barrier Resources Act, seeks to reduce vulnerability to future coastal hazards through postdisaster adjustments in the horizontal and vertical placement of structures, among other measures, This article reviews experience in rebuilding the North Carolina oceanfront after the 1996 hurricanes to discern the influence, if any, of these laws. The research is based on review of postdisaster assessments, interviews with key personnel, news media reports, and direct observation. We found widespread compliance with vertical elevation and building codes but rather uneven application of minimum setbacks under CAMA, especially where vegetation was removed. Oceanfront structures are being built more strongly to resist wave and wind forces but are vulnerable to ongoing erosion, resulting in beach and dune scour, and possible stranding of structures below the mean high water line. Experience with temporary replacement of dunes and the shore road at North Topsail Beach indicates that political pressure may overwhelm the intent of Congress to limit repetitive loss costs for infrastructure, especially in areas designated under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act.	coast; hazard; hurricane; law	2002	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Similarly, relationships between independent variables (DBH and HT); and nutrients (N, P and K) and carbon content in total above-ground biomass were also evaluated. The best fit allometric models were selected by considering the values of parameter of estimation of the models such as R2, CV, Rmse, MSerror, Sa, Sb, and Akaikeâ€™s information criterion corrected (AICc). The selected allometric models were Log BiomassÂ =Â 0.9256 Log DBH2Â âˆ’Â 2.133; Log biomassÂ =Â 1.1656 Log DBH2Â âˆ’Â 1.7047; Log biomassÂ =Â 1.0824 Log DBH2Â âˆ’Â 1.7568; Log biomassÂ =Â 1.0927 Log DBH2Â âˆ’Â 1.0275; Log biomassÂ =Â 1.0996 Log DBH2Â âˆ’Â 0.8572 respectively for leaf, branch, bark, stem without bark and total above-ground biomass. Whereas the selected allometric models for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and carbon were Log NÂ =Â 1.0972 Log DBH2Â âˆ’Â 3.0845; Log PÂ =Â 1.0947 Log DBH2Â âˆ’Â 5.6790; Log KÂ =Â 1.0990 Log DBH2Â âˆ’Â 3.0370; Log CÂ =Â 1.1 Log DBH2Â âˆ’Â 1.1937 respectively. Highest concentration of nitrogen (16.07Â mg/g) and phosphorus (0.05Â mg/g) was observed in leaf, while higher concentration (45.95â€“48.60Â %) of carbon was observed in stem and bigger branches.

91762176	132262	2018.8559	Who Manages Space? Eco-DRR and the Local Community	The notion of ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (DRR) has only recently emerged in Indonesia. The Indonesian central government now adopts some policies related to ecosystem-based DRR with formal commitments from local administrations. At the implementation level, various activities have taken place, such as mangrove planting and restoration along the coastline to address the rising sea level and the one billion trees program to address the urgent issue of deforestation. These governmental activities have involved local communities that reside in the high-risk area, while nonlocal actors, particularly from the private and the nongovernmental sectors, have contributed as a third element to development. This paper examines space management in the context of Eco-DRR, paying special attention to uncertainty and anxiety in the local communities as the government and private sectors engage in development activities that have significant impacts on their present and future lives. The present study pursues this purpose by means of in-depth interview and focus group discussions (FGD) with local leaders in mangrove planting and restoration programs. The study took place in a small island community in a part of the Jakarta Megapolitan Region, Indonesia. The results point out that the community feels left behind due to lack of trust in managing the conservation space. Another issue to be addressed is how to improve the democratization of environment management and livelihood base of the local community. Therefore, building confidence and ameliorating relationships between actors within/without the local community should lead to a better Eco-DRR initiative.	coastal community; disaster risk reduction; ecosystem; governance; mangrove resilience; participation	2018	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762183	10320	2022.1428	Mapping risk factors to climate change impacts using traditional ecological knowledge to support adaptation planning with a Native American Tribe in Louisiana	Indigenous communities are often on the front-lines of climate change, and for tribes such as the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe (PACIT) that make their homes and livelihoods in the dynamic landscapes of Coastal Louisiana (USA), sea-level rise, subsidence, and land loss are very real reminders of why they must continue to hone their adaptive capacity that has evolved over many generations and continues to evolve as the pace of change quickens. PACIT members have an inherited wisdom about their surrounding environment and continue to build on that body of observational knowledge that is passed from generation to generation to sustain themselves in this dynamic landscape. This knowledge is woven through their culture and is sometimes referred to as tradi-tional ecological knowledge (TEK). The PACIT and other Indigenous communities around the world are using creative strategies to adapt to the impacts of climate change that include partnering with researchers to combine their TEK with science in approaches to enhance strategies dealing with climate change impacts, mitigation, and adaptation. Tribes and other Indigenous communities often have a strong connection to place that helps to inspire innovative ideas to promote greater sustainability of vulnerable ecosystems and the communities that depend on them, but not the institutional support to implement them. Overcoming this barrier requires a better understanding of their perception of the issues and what they prioritize in sustaining their cultures and the ecosystems on which they depend. Better inclusion of their knowledge into applied research is necessary to support these communities in their efforts to make sure their knowledge is recognized, understood, and valued in environmental management applications. The primary goal for this study was to develop a decision-support tool that aids the PACIT in assessing local ecological change and associated risks to the Tribe's resilience. Using remote sensing datasets and geographic information systems (GIS) processes to represent aspects of the Tribe's TEK to achieve this goal, we developed methods for producing interactive maps that reflect local perceptions of landscape features within the Tribe's ecosystem-dependent livelihood base that contribute most to the com-munity's physical vulnerability to coastal hazards. This case study is offered to consider how Indigenous com-munities like the PACIT are shaping their own coastal hazards mitigation planning efforts in line with their unique needs, cultural practices, and values. The results of this study can provide relevant insight to applied environmental scientists and others working with Indigenous communities that are facing similar circumstances around the world.	traditional ecological knowledge; coastal hazards mitigation; mapping; geographic information systems; climate change; community resilience	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762184	134846	2021.15109	Genetics of growth and survival under chronic heat stress and trade-offs with growth- and robustness-related traits in rainbow trout	Artificial selection can be advantageous for breeding fish that are better adapted to temperature changes induced by climate change. Selecting fish with better growth performance and survival under long term thermal stress would require an understanding of the level of additive genetic variation for these traits. Moreover, disentangling the genetic co-variation between growthand robustness-related traits is key to understand potential antagonisms between selection for an increased performance and survivability. Thus, this study aimed at: i) assessing levels of genetic variation for growth and survival under chronic heat stress, and ii) evaluating the genetic relationship between these two traits and a broad range of growthand robustness-related traits to identify potential trade-offs in rainbow trout. Phenotypic and pedigree records (n = 65,298 animals) from a rainbow trout breeding population were used. Growth and survival under chronic thermal stress were defined as the final body weight (FWHT) and days to death (TSR), after the experimental chronic exposure to high temperature (between 18 and 22 degrees C). Other growth-related traits analyzed here were: body weight at smolt stage (SW), harvest weight (HW), weight at processing plant (WPP), fillet weight (FW), weight of the eviscerated fish (GUW) and body weight at low temperature (FWLT). Robustness-related traits evaluated here were: resistance against Piscirickettsia salmonis (PSR) and Flavobacterium psychrophilum (FPR), and susceptibility to Caligus rogercresseyi (CS). The heritabilites estimated were: FWHT = 0.41 +/- 0.14; TSR = 0.13 +/- 0.05; SW = 0.54 +/- 0.01; HW = 0.63 +/- 0.01; WPP = 0.19 +/- 0.02; FW = 0.03 +/- 0.03; GUW = 0.18 +/- 0.02; FWLT = 0.59 +/- 0.17; FPR = 0.35 +/- 0.05; PSR = 0.30 +/- 0.05; and CS 0.08 +/- 0.02. In general, strong compensations were identified between the robustnessand growthrelated traits with genetic correlations that ranged from -0.28 to -0.98, except for resistance to F. psychrophilum and growth-related traits, which showed correlation values from 0.28 to 0.46. Genetic improvement for growth and survival under chronic upper thermal exposure is feasible. Compensations between growthand robustnessrelated traits have to be accounted for when simultaneously including performance and disease resistance traits in the breeding objective.	heat stress; trade-offs; growth; robustness; rainbow trout; heritability; genetic correlations	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762196	10525	2021.1423	Quantifying stakeholder learning in climate change adaptation across multiple relational and participatory networks	Responding to accelerating climate change impacts requires broad and effective engagement with stakeholders, at multiple geographic and governance levels. Stakeholder participation has been hailed as a facilitated approach in climate change adaptation that supports social learning, depolarization of perceptions, and fosters collective action. But stakeholder participation remains loosely interpreted and evaluating measures are limited. This study employs social network analysis (SNA) to investigate how social relations among stakeholders, which emerge as a result of participation, are associated with stakeholder learning, as changes in perceptions of climate change. We hypothesized that reciprocal ties of understanding, respect, and influence can predict changes in perceptions of climate change. This approach was applied to a case study in Deal Island Peninsula, Maryland (USA) where local residents, scientists, and government officials met from 2016 to 2018 to collaboratively manage the impacts of sea-level rise in their communities. We found that social relations based on mutual understanding, respect, and influence are positively associated with perceptions of climate change. We provide a detailed conceptualization and implementation of a network-based approach that may serve as a potential quantitative performance measure of stakeholder participation processes in climate change adaptation. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence of the role that emerging social relations have on enhancing or constraining social learning among stakeholders in the Deal Island Peninsula project.	stakeholder participation; social network analysis; climate change adaptation; climate change; social learning; social contagion	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

The micrositing strategy of tidal current turbines (TCTs) and the collector system planning scheme are coordinated to achieve a better balance of energy yields, TCF capital investment and power systems economic operation using the proposed method. The power output of the TCF is modeled considering the characteristics of tidal current velocity and wake effects. A coordinated planning model consisting of one upper level model and two lower level models is developed to maximize comprehensive profit. Not only the investment and maintenance costs of TCTs and submarine cables, but also the operation cost of the collector system and the impact of the TCF integration on the operation of power systems are all taken into account to ensure the long-term benefits of both TCF owners and power systems. An efficient solution for the proposed planning model is developed by combining a genetic algorithm with a mixed integer programming. The effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method are demonstrated using the measured data of tidal current velocity with distinct characteristics and the IEEE 30- and 118-bus test systems.	bi-level programming; tidal current generation; tidal current farm planning; micro-siting of tidal current turbines	2019	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762202	227185	2013.9809	Wave resource assessment along the Cornish coast (UK) from a 23-year hindcast dataset validated against buoy measurements	Long-term knowledge of the wave climate of a potential wave energy site is essential for project planning and design, not only for an understanding of the resource variability, but also for the prediction of design wave conditions. The southwest region of the UK is at the forefront of the country's wave energy development, with two operational test sites. However, no detailed long-term resource assessment has yet been performed. This paper presents a long-term wave hindcast for southwest England, performed using the numerical wave model SWAN, with a particular focus on two energy device test facilities: `Wave Hub' on the energetic and exposed north Cornwall coast, and `FaB Test' on the more sheltered south coast. A high-resolution wave model suite, aimed at establishing nearshore wave hindcasts, is described and evaluated. The suite is run for a 23-year period, starting in 1989 and continuing to 2011. The hindcast is compared with measurement data and the results are analysed for the two test sites. Special attention is given to the implications of present hindcast errors and how the hindcast errors can be minimized. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

91762207	391756	2019.12431	Developing indicators to identify coastal green infrastructure potential: The case of the Salish Sea region	This study investigates where coastal green infrastructure (CGI) can provide highest potential coastal protection benefits, while considering its vulnerability to environmental conditions. CGI provides important coastal protection benefits, however, influenced by climate change and human activities, these benefits are highly threatened. This vulnerability of CGI was not considered in the previous studies. This study provides a framework and an indicator-based methodology to fill this gap. A review of the literature was conducted to identify the parameters used to measure CGI's coastal protection benefits and vulnerability. The content of the references that contained specific parameters related to CGI's role in coastal protection and vulnerability were systematically reviewed. A total of 11 indicators were identified and organized into two indices: CGI coastal protection index, and CGI vulnerability index. The indices were synthesized using a 2 Ã— 2 matrix to identify areas with the highest coastal protection potential. Analysis was conducted for the 74 most populated coastal communities in the Salish Sea region. Results indicate that the British Columbia communities in the Salish Sea region have high potential to utilize CGI for coastal protection. CGI in 59% of the communities in British Columbia and 36% in Washington State can provide high coastal protection benefits, even when vulnerability is accounted for.

91762208	85007	2022.6968	Conservation-Status Gaps for Marine Top-Fished Commercial Species	Biodiversity loss is a global problem, accelerated by human-induced pressures. In the marine realm, one of the major threats to species conservation, together with climate change, is overfishing. In this context, having information on the conservation status of target commercial marine fish species becomes crucial for assuring safe standards. We put together fisheries statistics from the FAO, the IUCN Red List, FishBase, and RAM Legacy databases to understand to what extent top commercial species' conservation status has been assessed. Levels of assessment for top-fished species were higher than those for general commercial or highly commercial species, but almost half of the species have outdated assessments. We found no relation between IUCN Red List traits and FishBase Vulnerability Index, depreciating the latter value as a guidance for extinction threat. The RAM database suggests good management of more-threatened species in recent decades, but more data are required to assess whether the trend has reverted in recent years. Outdated IUCN Red List assessments can benefit from reputed stock assessments for new reassessments. The future of IUCN Red List evaluations for commercial fish species relies on integrating new parameters from fisheries sources and improved collaboration with fisheries stakeholders and managers.	fishing importance; fao; iucn red list; ram legacy; overfishing; sustainability	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

Efforts to address this challenge are fraught and success' is elusive. We focus on this impasse and recommend ways to improve understanding, reduce risk and enable adaptation. Two Aotearoa New Zealand coastal communities, Mercury Bay and Kennedy Bay, on the Coromandel Peninsula, serve as case studies. Ethnographic fieldwork underpins this analysis. Despite close proximity, local perceptions are worlds apart'. Poor understanding of climate change, and preoccupation with everyday issues, is commonplace. Moreover, there are countervailing community narratives. In Kennedy Bay, which is undeveloped and Maori, climate change is not a manifest concern. Local narratives are rooted in Maori culture and under the shadow of colonization, which shapes contemporary perceptions, practices and prospects. In Mercury Bay, a rapidly developing resort town, seashore property owners demand protection worksignoring sea-level rise and privileging short-term private interests. Despite laudable regulatory provisions, static responses to dynamic risks prevail and proactive adaptation is absent. Recommendations are made to improve understanding about local cultural-social-ecological characteristics, climate change and adaption. Enabling leadership and capability-building are needed to institutionalize proactive adaptation. Strengthening Maori self-determination (rangatiratanga) and guardianship (kaitiakitanga), and local democracy, are key to mobilizing and sustaining community-based adaptation governance.	aotearoa new zealand; coromandel; kennedy bay; mercury bay; whitianga; vulnerability; climate change; coastal hazard risk; adaptation governance	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

The assessment covered the mass and energy balance of the entire process followed by the economic feasibility study, which included the total cost estimation, net present value calculation, and sensitivity analysis. The selected plant size corresponded to a community based AD of 1.6 MWth with a macro-algae feed rate of 8.64 tonnes per day (dry basis). The produced biogas was utilised in a combined heat and power plant generating 237 kWe(net) electricity and 367 kW(th) heat. The breakeven electricity-selling price in this study was estimated at around (sic)120/MWh. On the ground of different national and regional policies, this study did not account for any government incentives. However, different support mechanisms such as Feed-in-Tariffs or Renewable Obligation Certificates can significantly improve the project viability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

91762224	368320	2003.4056	Identifying the effect of tidal height on offshore winds speed profiles	The rise and fall of the sea surface due to the tide effectively moves an offshore wind turbine hub through the wind shear profile. Offshore wind farms are being built around the coasts of Europe, including in the Baltic and the North Sea. Tidal ranges in the North Sea are greater than those in the Baltic, and the potential effect on the wind shear profile of the change in sea surface height is likely to be more significant. This article seeks to identify the effect of tidal height on the shear profile at a mast off the east coast of the UK where the maximum tidal range is 7 m. Definite evidence for the effect of tidal height on wind shear is presented, though the effect is small and there is considerable scatter in the data.

Coastal engineers and managers often rely on gray infrastructure such as seawalls, levees and breakwaters, but are increasingly seeking to incorporate more sustainable natural and nature-based features (NNBF). While coastal restoration projects have been happening for decades, NNBF projects go above and beyond coastal restoration. They seek to provide communities with coastal protection from storms, erosion, and/or flooding while also providing some of the other natural benefits that restored habitats provide. Yet there remain many unknowns about how to design and implement these projects. This study examines three innovative coastal resilience projects that use NNBF approaches to improve coastal community resilience to flooding while providing a host of other benefits: 1) Living Breakwaters in New York Harbor; 2) the Coastal Texas Protection and Restoration Study; and 3) the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project in San Francisco Bay. We synthesize findings from these case studies to report areas of progress and illustrate remaining challenges. All three case studies began with innovative project funding and framing that enabled expansion beyond a sole focus on flood risk reduction to include multiple functions and benefits. Each project involved stakeholder engagement and incorporated feedback into the design process. In the Texas case study this dramatically shifted one part of the project design from a more traditional, gray approach to a more natural hybrid solution. We also identified common challenges related to permitting and funding, which often arise as a consequence of uncertainties in performance and long-term sustainability for diverse NNBF approaches. The Living Breakwaters project is helping to address these uncertainties by using detailed computational and physical modeling and a variety of experimental morphologies to help facilitate learning while monitoring future performance. This paper informs and improves future sustainable coastal resilience projects by learning from these past innovations, highlighting the need for integrated and robust monitoring plans for projects after implementation, and emphasizing the critical role of stakeholder engagement.	coastal resiliency; restoration; stakeholder engagement; nnbf design; nnbf monitoring	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762234	197130	2012.7428	The full-height lattice tower concept	An alternative support structure for offshore wind turbines is presented that removes the need for an expensive transition piece and allows for significant savings in steel weight. The concept is based on replacing both the traditional wind turbine tower and the usual support structure with a single lattice tower that extends from the sea bottom to the rotor-nacelle-assembly. An overview is given of studies performed and results obtained for this design so far, of its advantages and disadvantages, and of future plans for improved automatic optimization of the design. Although it is difficult to show the economic viability of the full-height lattice tower concept, due to the general problem of reliably quantifying fabrication and installation costs, the major reduction in steel weight makes this an attractive concept that should be given further consideration, especially for future offshore projects in deep waters.

91762235	197311	2020.15451	Influences of surface waves on the power generation performance of a ocean current energy turbine	It is known that wave has significant influence on ocean current turbines during the process of collecting energy. In order to study the influence of waves on the hydrodynamic performance of a near-surface vertical axis water turbine (VAWT), this paper carries out a series of two-dimensional transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. First, a two-dimensional numerical wave basin based on CFD is built by defining inlet boundary. The accuracy of the numerical method is ensured through comparison between numerical wave shape and theoretical Stokes wave shape. The influences of waves are quantitatively analyzed by separately discussing hydrodynamics performances and flow structures of a VAWT under different wave heights and submerged depth. It is found that the average torque, the fluctuation amplitude of the torque and power coefficient increase with the increased wave height, and decrease with the increased submerged depth.	wave; tidal turbine; computational fluid dynamics (cfd); vertical axis water turbine (vawt); stokes wave	2020	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762236	244596	2020.6929	Evaluating the viability of coastal wet grassland to a changing management regime through flood hazard modelling	The high-risk nature of low-lying coastal areas means that many are characterised by protective dikes, sea walls, and earthen embankments. Across Europe, such structures are employed to limit landward sea flooding and have been used historically to reclaim wetlands, many of which have since gained international protected habitat status. Sea level rise and storms threaten the future viability of fixed flood defences which will be overtopped with increasing frequency and, in extreme cases, breached. This raises questions surrounding defence maintenance and the fate of the reclaimed wetlands they encircle and support. One approach is to design defences with the expectation that they will be overtopped during extreme events, but that catastrophic failure as a result of breaching will be prevented. Such an approach was recently implemented at Blakeney Freshes, North Norfolk Coast, UK, an embanked area of reedbeds and coastal wet grassland. Lowering and widening of the Freshes embankment was undertaken following extensive breaching during the 5 December 2013 storm surge. In this paper we develop and apply a numerical model chain, comprising storm surge water levels, waves, and overtopping, to explore inundation extent, depth, and duration resulting from storm surge induced flooding under several sea level rise scenarios. Modelling results revealed that 99.5\% of the flood volume of the 2013 event resulted from embankment breaching. Simulating the same storm event after embankment reprofiling shows that flooding of the Freshes is reduced by 97\%, largely because the lower, wider embankments preclude breaching. However, under future sea level rise scenarios, storm surge induced overtopping results in increased inundation depths and drainage times, raising questions regarding the resilience of vegetation communities within the Freshes. By 2100 under the lowest SLR scenario, and by 2050 under the mid SLR scenario, over half of the Freshes will be inundated for > 10 days, a potentially critical threshold for current wet grassland survival. Our findings suggest that while effective defence redesign may increase the viability of reclaimed wetland habitats in the short term, as sea levels rise, lengthened inundation durations may render these habitats increasingly vulnerable to ecosystem change under extreme events.	overtopping; breaching; reclaimed wetland; storm surge; embankment; coastal protection	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762254	328424	2017.12260	Effect of wind and wave directionality on the structural performance of non-operational offshore wind turbines supported by jackets during hurricanes	Risk of hurricane damage is an important factor in the development of the offshore wind energy industry in the United States. Hurricane loads on an offshore wind turbine (OWT), namely wind and wave loads, not only exert large structural demands, but also have temporally changing characteristics, especially with respect to their directions. Waves are less susceptible to rapid changes, whereas wind can change its properties over shorter time scales. Misalignment of local winds and ocean waves occurs regularly during a hurricane. The strength capacity of non-axisymmetric structures such as jackets is sensitive to loading direction and misalignment relative to structural orientation. As an example, this work examines the effect of these issues on the extreme loads and structural response of a non-operational OWT during hurricane conditions. The considered OWT is a 5 MW turbine, supported by a jacket structure and located off the Massachusetts coast. A set of 1000 synthetic hurricane events, selected from a catalog simulating 100,000 years of hurricane activity, is used to represent hurricane conditions, and the corresponding wind speeds, wave heights and directions are estimated using empirical, parametric models for each hurricane. The impact of wind and wave directions and structural orientation are quantified through a series of nonlinear static analyses under various assumptions for combining the directions of wind and wave and structural orientation for the considered example structure.

91762257	300474	2021.5667	Ecosystem-Atmosphere Exchange of CO2, Water, and Energy in a Basin Mangrove of the Northeastern Coast of the Yucatan Peninsula	Coastal settings variations are linked to composition, structural, and functional differences among mangrove ecotypes. Basin mangroves undergo larger flooding and salinity fluctuations, yet remain understudied, compared to other ecotypes. We evaluated the effect of flooding and air temperature (T a) on the surface energy balance and eddy covariance-derived net CO2 ecosystem exchange (NEE) of a basin mangrove with sporadic freshwater flooding. During the study period (June 2017â€“November 2018) the site was more frequently not flooded. Under these conditions, in combination with high T a (&gt;27Â°C), daytime CO2 uptake was significantly lower, while evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux were higher than when flooded. CO2 uptake increased with T a and vapor pressure deficit, but after exceeding a threshold (29Â°C and 1.4Â kPa), uptake declined. Flooding extended this T a threshold by 3Â°C and increased the radiation saturation point of NEE. The ecosystem is a net sink of CO2 annually (709Â Â±Â 09Â g C mâˆ’2Â yrâˆ’1), however, it turned a net source of CO2 for 3Â months of prolonged rainfall deficit. Most of the precipitation input is returned to the atmosphere (evaporative index: 0.94) and on average, for each gram of atmospheric carbon assimilated into the ecosystem, 2.21Â Â±Â 0.50Â kg of water was returned to the atmosphere. This ecosystem-level water-use efficiency decreased with flooding, but the correlation was not strong. Future temperature increases and lower precipitation (local and regional), combined with lower water table (and/or stronger saline intrusion), imply important losses of primary productivity and stored soil carbon in basin mangroves of northeast Yucatan Peninsula.

91762261	228121	2016.12685	A Multi-Objective Optimization Framework for Offshore Wind Farm Layouts and Electric Infrastructures	Current offshore wind farms (OWFs) design processes are based on a sequential approach which does not guarantee system optimality because it oversimplifies the problem by discarding important interdependencies between design aspects. This article presents a framework to integrate, automate and optimize the design of OWF layouts and the respective electrical infrastructures. The proposed framework optimizes simultaneously different goals (e.g., annual energy delivered and investment cost) which leads to efficient trade-offs during the design phase, e.g., reduction of wake losses vs collection system length. Furthermore, the proposed framework is independent of economic assumptions, meaning that no a priori values such as the interest rate or energy price, are needed. The proposed framework was applied to the Dutch Borssele areas I and II. A wide range of OWF layouts were obtained through the optimization framework. OWFs with similar energy production and investment cost as layouts designed with standard sequential strategies were obtained through the framework, meaning that the proposed framework has the capability to create different OWF layouts that would have been missed by the designers. In conclusion, the proposed multi-objective optimization framework represents a mind shift in design tools for OWFs which allows cost savings in the design and operation phases.	offshore wind farms; wind farm designers; trade-offs; multi-objective optimization; economic functions; design parameters	2016	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We interrelate concepts from recent research on the climate-heritage-nexus with contemporary coastal climate adaptation projects to reveal some of the complex realities and nuances that are apparent on the ground, and to raise heritage concerns for future practice. Questioning the role that heritage plays in specific climate adaptation projects from Denmark and the Netherlands, two low-lying countries with long coastlines facing climate risks, we show the wide range of roles that heritage can play in climate adaptation planning and we propose a framework to conceptualise heritage in this context. The study shows the important role that climate imaginaries (i.e. depictions, affect, and ways of apprehending the climate past) play in climate adaptation projects, and reveals national and local differences. Finally, we discuss the knowledge gained from climate adaption projects in terms of developing dynamic responses to climate change, of working with rather than against landscape processes, and the potential role of heritage in creating climate-resilient living environments.	coastal landscapes; climate imaginaries; sea-level rise; climate adaptation; dynamic approaches to heritage	2022	Devi	Laurent	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

91762287	195698	2015.9849	Computational Modeling of Rolling Wave-Energy Converters in a Viscous Fluid	The performance of an asymmetrical rolling cam as an ocean-wave energy extractor was studied experimentally and theoretically in the 70s. Previous inviscid-fluid theory indicated that energy-absorbing efficiency could approach 100\% in the absence of real-fluid effects. The way viscosity alters the performance is examined in this paper for two distinctive rolling-cam shapes: a smooth ``Eyeball Cam (EC){''} with a simple mathematical form and a `` Keeled Cam (KC){''} with a single sharp-edged keel. Frequency-domain solutions in an inviscid fluid were first sought for as baseline performance metrics. As expected, without viscosity, both shapes, despite their differences, perform exceedingly well in terms of extraction efficiency. The hydrodynamic properties of the two shapes were then examined in a real fluid, using the solution methodology called the free-surface random-vortex method (FSRVM). The added inertia and radiation damping were changed, especially for the KC. With the power-take-off (PTO) damping present, non-linear time-domain solutions were developed to predict the rolling motion, the effects of PTO damping, and the effects of the cam shapes. For the EC, the coupled motion of sway, heave and roll in waves was investigated to understand how energy extraction was affected.

91762288	60615	2016.3728	CO2 Capture, Transportation, and Storage Technology	Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) can be deployed primarily at major point sources of CO2, such as fossil fuel-fired power plants. For CO2 capture, solution absorption as represented by liquid amine scrubbing is the most widely investigated. Membrane separation in pressurized flue gas, such as in an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), is expected to reduce energy and cost. The majority of energy and cost during CCS is in the capture process. The roadmap of CO2 capture targets a cost reduction from 4200 JPY (current references) to 1000 JPY by 2030. For CO2 transportation, although pipeline transportation is a mature technology, ship transportation is not widely used but is expected to be effective for offshore CCS in Japan. The roadmap of transportation has a 2050 infrastructure target connecting a cluster of substantial CO2 sources to storage sites with a combination of pipelines and ship transportation. There are three important factors for feasible implementation of CO2 storage: capacity, injectivity, and security (containment). Japan has great potential to store CO2 in offshore geological formations. CO2 injection in geological reservoirs is also an established technology in oil mining via CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which is a technology analogous to CCS. Stable long-term CO2 containment in geologic formations is a scientific and technical agenda. The roadmap of storage technology has a target of monitoring cost reduction and technology development to enhance CO2 trapping in those formations.	ccs; co2 capture; co2 transportation; co2 storage; energy penalty	2016	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91762293	153404	2016.9912	Local adaptation in an estuarine foundation species: Implications for restoration	Understanding the extent of local adaptation is critical for conservation and restoration planning in an era of environmental change. Adaptive differentiation among populations may mediate a species' response to environmental stress, yet these evolutionary processes are seldom studied in marine systems. We used native Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) as a model organism for studying local adaptation with applications to marine restoration. We tested whether populations of oysters in California estuaries are locally adapted to their home sites and to stressful low salinity events, which are predicted to increase in frequency with climate change. We spawned oysters from three sites in San Francisco Bay and raised their offspring under common laboratory conditions. These oysters were then reciprocally transplanted among the three field sites. At two of the three sites, oysters of local origin tended to survive better than those from other populations, suggesting that local adaptation may occur even within a single estuary. In a subsequent experiment, we raised oysters from two sites in San Francisco Bay and one site in Tomales Bay through two generations under common conditions and then subjected these oysters to a low salinity challenge in the laboratory. Oysters with the highest survival originated from the site with the lowest field salinity, suggesting that natural selection may favor stress tolerant phenotypes in certain regions. As interest grows in restoring heavily impacted native species, our results indicate that considering local adaptation may be essential to deciding how and where to conserve and restore species faced with changing conditions.

To protect biodiversity in coastal areas, there is an urgent need to identify conservation priorities in response to sea level rise and land use change. In this study, an integrated modeling process using a geomorphological model, species habitat models, and conservation prioritization is developed to identify conservation priorities in the face of sea level rise and land use change. We present a case study in the Matanzas River Basin of Northeast Florida that utilizes this integrated modeling approach with data for 38 focal species. We incorporate species-specific connectivity requirements in the analysis and compare the conservation priorities with existing conservation datasets including current conservation areas and the Florida Ecological Greenways Network (FEGN). Results show that current reserves are not adequate to protect some of the most important conservation priorities in response to sea level rise but the updated FEGN does serve as a good foundation to inform future conservation decisions relevant to sea level rise. To protect the top 10\% conservation priorities, approximately 11,700, 10,900 and 15,200 acres of additional land will need to be acquired for the 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 m sea level rise scenarios respectively.

91762299	37974	2002.757	Present state and future of the world's mangrove forests	Mangroves, the only woody halophytes living at the confluence of land and sea, have been heavily used traditionally for food, timber, fuel and medicine, and presently occupy about 181 000 km(2) of tropical and subtropical coastline. Over the past 50 years, approximately one-third of the world's mangrove forests have been lost, but most data show very variable loss rates and there is considerable margin of error in most estimates. Mangroves are a valuable ecological and economic resource, being important nursery grounds and breeding sites for birds, fish, crustaceans, shellfish, reptiles and mammals; a renewable source of wood; accumulation sites for sediment, contaminants, carbon and nutrients; and offer protection against coastal erosion. The destruction of mangroves is usually positively related to human population density. Major reasons for destruction are urban development, aquaculture, mining and overexploitation for timber, fish, crustaceans and shellfish. Over the next 25 years, unrestricted clear felling, aquaculture, and overexploitation of fisheries will be the greatest threats, with lesser problems being alteration of hydrology, pollution and global warming. Loss of biodiversity is, and will continue to be, a severe problem as even pristine mangroves are species-poor compared with other tropical ecosystems. The future is not entirely bleak. The number of rehabilitation and restoration projects is increasing worldwide with some countries showing increases in mangrove area. The intensity of coastal aquaculture appears to have levelled off in some parts of the world. Some commercial projects and. economic models indicate that mangroves can be used as a sustainable resource, especially for wood. The brightest note is that the rate of population growth is projected to slow during the next 50 years, with a gradual decline thereafter to the end of the century. Mangrove forests will continue to be exploited at current rates to 2025, unless they are seen as a valuable resource to be managed on a sustainable basis. After 2025, the future of mangroves will depend on technological and ecological advances in multi-species silviculture, genetics, and forestry modelling, but the greatest hope for their future is for a reduction in human population growth.	mangrove forest; conservation; exploitation; coastal resources; management; current state; projection	2002	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Both projects identified barriers - including regulatory, financing, liability and insurance issues; environmental concerns; stakeholder perceptions; and lack of appropriate skills â€“ that hamper the development of multi-use platforms. The H2020 MARIBE project concluded that further funding for multi-use demonstrations should be provided to increase investor confidence and bring multi-use through the so-called Valley of Death. The H2020 MUSES project concluded that multi-use needs to be proactively facilitated and incentivised through public regulatory bodies and respective support programmes. This paper combines and analyses results from both projects in order to identify key research gaps and actions required for the continued development of multi-use platforms, based on a structured critical review of available peer-reviewed literature on the topic as well as reports of both the MUSES and MARIBE projects. Research gaps and actions are analysed based on a multi-use platform typology to inform developers, policy makers, academia and investors for future development of multi-use at sea.

Currently, the removal of grease from wind turbines offshore in the North Sea is done by dismantling the bearing covers and scraping off the grease. This procedure is long, labour intensive and raises maintenance cost. Another issue is the environmental policy, the approval for newly introduced chemicals for flushing purposes are procedurally long. If the problems with grease removal could be solved in a different way other than manual removal or using chemicals, it will open many new market opportunities and would carved out a niche for the wind turbine maintenance industry. The solution of flushing grease could lower cost, time and reduce environmental impact by applying Supercritical Carbon Dioxide. The oil based grease SKF LGWM 1 was designed to handle extreme pressure and low temperature conditions. The grease covered the main bearing for 4 - 5 y in a wind turbine at Horns Rev 1 Offshore Wind Farm in the North Sea, 14 km from the west coast of Denmark. The series of experiments focused on higher pressures and temperatures as well as the use of some co-solvents. The highest recovery by pure carbon dioxide is 26 % and was achieved at 60 MPa and 80 Â°C while the addition of Kirasol-318SC improved the recovery by 8 % at the same conditions. Outgassing losses increase with the addition of kirasol. The low recoveries and high pressures obtained by the experiment do not provide an applicable method for grease removal; however it can be implemented for the removal of the contaminants from grease wastes.

The selection of effective adaptation interventions to manage these risks requires a sufficiently accurate assessment of the coastal hazard at a given location. Yet challenges remain in terms of understanding local coastal risks given the coarseness of global wave models and the paucity of locally scaled data in most developing countries, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) like Vanuatu. This paper aims to examine the differences in hazard assessment and adaptation option selections arising from analyses using globally versus locally scaled data on coastal processes. As a case study, we focused on an eroding cliff face in Port Resolution on Tanna Island, Vanuatu, which is of concern to the local community and government authorities. The coastal process modeling revealed that the global wave data generated unrealistically high predictions of wave height within Port Resolution Bay. Expensive engineering adaptations designed to provide coastal protection were therefore likely to fail in preventing ongoing cliff erosion. In this case, the best adaptation solution involves changing land use to revegetate and help stabilize the cliff top. Our case study highlights the importance of accurate hazard assessment, especially in data-poor regions where the extrapolation of global datasets and models in the absence of local data can result in poor adaptation decision-making. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary approach applied here can be applied in other data-poor regions to strengthen analyses exploring the benefits of local adaptation interventions.	coastal hazards; climate change adaptation; cost-benefit analysis; numerical modeling; sids; vanuatu	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

Therefore, in the scaling up of a wave energy converter, the captured wave energy increases slowly in proportion to the wave front width of the device while its cost tends to increase in a pace faster than the square of device size. To overcome the problem, the authors propose a drag type cross-flow water turbine with its rotational axis lying horizontally and parallel to the wave front. Since the device will be light-weight and linearly extendable in the wave front direction, the larger (longer) converter can obtain the merits of scale for higher economic performance. The shape of proposed turbine is not axisymmetric for directly utilizing the orbital fluid particle motion in wave. The basic unit of the device is compact and the diameter of turbine is in the order of wave height. Two-dimensional flow simulation of the device in regular wave demonstrates the mechanism of the turbine and provides its preliminary performance prediction.

91762318	197453	2017.11757	The power available to tidal turbines in an open channel flow	Linear momentum actuator disc theory is extended to address the power available to a tidal turbine array spanning the cross-section of an open channel flow. A generalised formulation is presented, which relaxes constraints in previous models on the Froude number of the flow and the geometry of the turbine array, and also considers the effects of far-wake mixing on the overall power removed from the flow. In the limiting case of no free surface deformation, the rigid lid model is recovered. Blockage, the ratio of turbine frontal area to the cross-sectional area of the surrounding flow passage, has the greatest effect on available power, with the peak power coefficient increasing by 55\% from 0.60 to 0.93 as the blockage ratio increases from 0.05 to 0.20. A further 3\% increase in peak power coefficient is achieved as the Froude number increases from 0.05 to 0.20. The efficiency of energy extraction may be determined relative to the total power extracted from the flow, comprising the power available to the turbines, and the power dissipated in wake mixing. Higher blockage turbines operating at low thrust coefficients are shown to be more efficient than lower blockage turbines.	fluid mechanics; mathematical modelling; renewable energy	2017	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762322	244953	2020.18269	From Pest to Profit-The Potential of Shipworms for Sustainable Aquaculture	We face a food crisis. Suboptimal diet is the biggest cause of death worldwide, food production the biggest greenhouse gas emitting sector, and by 2050 an extra 2.5 billion people need affordable nutrition. Current farming systems will fail to tackle this crisis, and there is an urgent need to diversify global food production and find effective solutions in currently underexploited food sectors. Shipworms, or shell-lessTeredoclams, could prove a highly valuable component of such solutions. Historically viewed as a marine pest, they have unique physiological characteristics which make them an ideal food source, including exceptionally fast growth rates, the ability to feed on waste wood or sustainable microalgae, and a high protein and omega 3 content. Today only a select few traditional cultures in the Philippines consume shipworms, but there is considerable opportunity to develop mechanisms to farm shipworms and provide a sustainable, nutrient rich, affordable food source. This will require significant challenges to be overcome, ranging from fundamental research to industry development to food processing and marketing. Leveraging new innovations in breeding, aquaculture feeds, growth systems, food processing methodologies and consumer engagement can however offer powerful solutions, and could help turn what was once a maritime villain into a nutritional savior.	aquaculture; shipworm; teredo navalis; sustainable; nutrition; clam; food security; bivalve	2020	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
91762329	233375	2022.9684	Vegetation bioshield for coastal protection in South Asia: Status and way forward	Tsunamis, storm surges, flooding, and erosion pose serious threats to the world's coastal systems, particularly in the tropics. These immediate threats have been accelerated by both natural and man-made factors. The majority of countries have responded to these threats with severe protective measures, exacerbating existing ecosystem problems. To combat this threat, there is an immediate need for sustainable coastal protection measures. Vegetation Bioshields are one such measure to achieve this. This review examines the current state of vegetation bioshields in South Asia, the benefits and drawbacks of their use, and future prospects. Case studies from India and Sri Lanka are used to illustrate the current state of vegetation bioshields. The majority of vegetation bioshield projects were constructed in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami with inadequate design, maintenance, and follow-up, resulting in an extremely low success rate. Additionally, community participation is limited in a number of vegetation bioshield planting campaigns. A viable alternative to hard structures is the concept of hybrid structures, which combine hard structures with natural ecosystems such as vegetation. A comprehensive inventory of indigenous species and policy changes aimed at their conservation and management are urgently needed. Simultaneously, strict enforcement of environmental laws is required.	bioshield; coastal vegetation; south asia; coastal protection; disaster management	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0
91762331	10064	2018.1032	Aligning fisheries aid with international development targets and goals	Official development assistance (ODA) is intended to spur progress and increase security among recipient countries. Billions in ODA have been allocated to fisheries to support nutrition and livelihoods worldwide. Yet, from 2010 to 2015, fisheries allocations decreased by > 30\%, while grants for non-fisheries sectors increased by > 13\%. Globally, grants for climate change adaptation and mitigation fell for fisheries, while rapidly increasing in sectors like agriculture and forestry. In Oceania, a region highly dependent on fisheries for food security and particularly vulnerable to climate change, disbursements fell by 44\%. Grants for fisheries research, education and training fell in absolute numbers, and as a proportion of total ODA to fisheries. These findings are out of alignment with recent international commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (2015), The Future We Want (2012), and relevant Aichi Targets (2010). Risk aversion among donors; redirection of climate finance into other sectors; and allocation decisions based on factors unrelated to fisheries are identified as contributing to observed findings. Increasing the volume of fisheries-related ODA and better aligning it with international commitments could bring substantial co-benefits and contribute to the sustainable use of marine ecosystems, support sustainable trade and economic opportunities, increase adaptive capacity, and foster human well-being.	development aid; fisheries management; small-scale fisheries; small-island developing states; pacific islands and territories; least developed countries; sustainable development goals	2018	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

The team identified several opportunities to cut costs, mitigate risks and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. At the outset, a detailed condition assessment and numerical analysis of existing flood defence structures enabled many of them to be reused, even though most were originally thought to be at the end of their design life.

91762340	279868	2008.500	Very high-resolution seismo-acoustic imaging of seagrass meadows (Mediterranean Sea): Implications for carbon sink estimates	Posidonia oceanica is a widespread coastal Mediterranean seagrass which accumulates in its subsurface large quantities of organic material derived from its roots, rhizomes and leaf sheaths embedded in sandy sediments. These organic deposits may be up to several meters thick as they accumulate over thousands of years forming the matte, whose high content in organic carbon plays a major role in the global ocean carbon cycle. In this study, very high-resolution seismo-acoustic methods were applied to image the subsurface features of a P. oceanica seagrass meadow at Portlligat (CadaquÃ©s, Girona, Spain), in the NW-Mediterranean Sea. Our findings yield fresh insights into the settling of the P. oceanica meadow in the study area, and define with unprecedented detail the potential volume occupied by the matte. A strong reflector, located from 4.3 to 11.7 m depth, was recognized in several seismo-acoustic profiles as the substratum on which P. oceanica first settled in the study area. A 3D bathymetric model of this substratum allowed us to reconstruct the Portlligat palaeo-environment prior to the settling of P. oceanica, which corresponded to a shallow coastal setting protected from the open sea. A core drilled in the meadow at Portlligat revealed the presence of a 6 in thick dense matte composed of medium to coarse, sandy sediments mixed with plant debris and bioclasts. Radiocarbon datings revealed a constant accretion rate of the matte of about 1.1 m/kyr. Gravelly bioclastic deposits observed at the base of the core correspond to the base of the matte and gave a date of 5616 Â± 46 Cal yr BP. For the first time, very high-resolution marine geophysical techniques allowed us to accurately define the volume occupied by P. oceanica matte, which in the study area reaches up to almost 220,000 Â± 17,400 M3. This result is an important step forward in our efforts to estimate the size of the carbon sink represented by P. oceanica meadows along the Mediterranean coasts significantly contributing to the biosphere carbon cycle.

91762341	243244	2022.19765	Unequal Retreats: How Racial Segregation Shapes Climate Adaptation	Recent research on climate adaptation points to the need to take flood control seriously as a state-led process that organizes and responds to the racial and environmental spaces of cities. The present study advances that agenda by focusing on the federally funded retreat of homes and residents from flood-prone urban neighborhoods. While officially organized by rational engineering and technocratic calculations, its implementation cannot escape the racialized landscapes of U.S. cities. To illustrate, we review how a century of unequal environmental planning and housing policy has forged today's racialized urban landscapes. Then, we turn to the federal government's entrance into those landscapes via its policy of managed retreat that purchases flood-prone homes and returns them to nature. Here we draw on nationwide data to reveal the policy's increasing urban orientation. We then present evidence from Houston to reveal how the racial composition and turnover of local neighborhoods influence program implementation and subsequent relocation. While not every city may experience the same racialized patterns as Houston, they will exhibit some patterns due to the powerful social and environmental force that race has long exerted in U.S. cities. Failing to account for that force will compromise efforts to adapt effectively to climate change.	urban environment; urban planning; spatial; neighborhood; mobility	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762345	135117	2022.15224	Tidal influence on the relationship between solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and canopy photosynthesis in a coastal salt marsh	Accurately estimating the dynamics of ecosystem photosynthesis in coastal wetlands is of paramount importance to the quantification of blue carbon and climate change. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence at 760 nm (SIF760) and the gross primary productivity (GPP), as well as the underlying mechanisms in coastal salt marshes that are regularly flooded by tides, based on continuous observations of the SIF760 and GPP throughout the growing season of Phragmites australis during 2019. The results show that the SIF760 was significantly correlated with the GPP on the half-hourly, daily, and weekly scales in different phenological stages, and the linearity of the SIF760-GPP relationship generally improved as the time scale increased. Moreover, we found that the canopy structure (i.e., leaf area index and spatial distribution of leaf angles) plays a major role in explaining the relationship between the SIF760 and photosynthesis on half-hourly and daily scales at the study site. Tidal flooding significantly suppressed the strength of the correlation between SIF760 and GPP in the early and rapid growth vegetation stage. Furthermore, the tides generally lowered the degree of the correlation between the light use efficiency for photosynthesis (LUEp) and the SIF yield, and between the LUEp and the canopy SIF760 escape probability. This indicates that tidal inundation diminished the roles of the plant physiology and canopy structure in explaining the relationship between the SIF760 and photosynthesis, and thus, it had a negative effect on the SIF760-based GPP estimation. The results of this study demonstrate that tidal inundation exerts a significant influence on the relationships between the SIF760 and GPP and their responses to the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, which leads to a better understanding of the mechanism linking the SIF760 and photosynthesis in tidal wetlands and provides new insights into reliable blue carbon quantification in a large scale domain.	coastal salt marsh; solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (sif); gross primary productivity (gpp); photosynthesis; tidal influence	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762346	331120	2017.11568	STRENGTH ANALYSIS OF A LARGE-SIZE SUPPORTING STRUCTURE FOR AN OFFSHORE WIND TURBINE	The offshore wind power industry is the branch of electric energy production from renewable sources which is most intensively developed in EU countries. At present, there is a tendency to install larger-power wind turbines at larger distances from the seashore, on relatively deep waters. Consequently, technological solutions for new supporting structures intended for deeper water regions are undergoing rapid development now. Various design types are proposed and analysed, starting from gravitational supports (GBS), through monopiles and 3D frame structures (jackets, tripods), and ending with floating and submerged supports anchored to the seabed by flexible connectors, including TLP type solutions. The article presents the results of examination of an untypical large-size gravitational support intended for waters with the depth of up to 40 m. Firstly, a general concept of the new design is presented, while the next basic part of the article describes the support design in detail and provides its strength analysis. The examined support has the form of a large steel container consisting of conical segments. The strength analysis was conducted using the finite element method (FEM), in accordance with the standard DNVGL-ST-0126. Modifications introduced to the most heavily loaded structural node of the support, which was the set of base bottom trusses, is also included. The results of the performed analysis prove that the presented concept of supporting structure for a 7MW turbine meets fundamental strength criteria. The nonlinear buckling analysis was performed to evaluate the critical force acting on the support, which turned out to be 1.44 times as large as the maximum load of the wind turbine. Potentially important issues for further analyses have been identified as those resulting from the asymmetry of basic loads acting on the support.	buckling;  computational fluid dynamics;  computer simulation;  conceptual design;  finite element method;  ocean engineering;  offshore wind turbines;  renewable energy resources;  steel containers;  strength of materials;  strengthening (metal);  thin walled structures;  wind power;  wind turbines, numerical calculation;  off-shore wind power;  renewable energy source;  strength analysis;  supporting structure, structural design	2017	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Throughout the year, seagrass meadows are exposed to abiotic and biotic variations linked to (i) seasonal fluctuations, (ii) short-term stress events such as, e.g., local nutrient enrichment, and (iii) small-scale disturbances such as, e.g., biomass removal by grazing. We hypothesized that short-term stress events and small-scale disturbances may affect seagrass chance for survival in temperate latitudes. To test this hypothesis we focused on seagrass carbon reserves in the form of starch stored seasonally in rhizomes, as these have been defined as a good indicator for winter survival. Twelve Zostera noltei meadows were monitored along a latitudinal gradient in Western Europe to firstly assess the seasonal change of their rhizomal starch content. Secondly, we tested the effects of nutrient enrichment and/or biomass removal on the corresponding starch content by using a short-term manipulative field experiment at a single latitude in the Netherlands. At the end of the growing season, we observed a weak but significant linear increase of starch content along the latitudinal gradient from south to north. This agrees with the contention that such reserves are essential for regrowth after winter, which is more severe in the north. In addition, we also observed a weak but significant positive relationship between starch content at the beginning of the growing season and past winter temperatures. This implies a lower regrowth potential after severe winters, due to diminished starch content at the beginning of the growing season. Short-term stress and disturbances may intensify these patterns, because our manipulative experiments show that when nutrient enrichment and biomass loss co-occurred at the end of the growing season, Z. noltei starch content declined. In temperate zones, the capacity of seagrasses to accumulate carbon reserves is expected to determine carbon-based regrowth after winter. Therefore, processes affecting those reserves might affect seagrass resilience. With increasing human pressure on coastal systems, short- and small-scale stress events are expected to become more frequent, threatening the resilience of seagrass ecosystems, particularly at higher latitudes, where populations tend to have an annual cycle highly dependent on their storage capacity.	carbon reserves; european atlantic coast; latitude; resilience; zostera noltei; climate setting; stress events	2018	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This article examines the political economy of risk reduction, using a case study of Louisiana's coastal restoration planning and decision-making process. Specifically, the article draws on documentary evidence, long-term ethnographic field observations, and semistructured interviews to investigate the proliferation of risk conflicts and disputes surrounding the 2012 Louisiana Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast, the latest long-term risk-reduction plan to slow coastal erosion and achieve a sustainable coast. As I point out, coastal restoration in Louisiana is contested terrain where a variety of contentious groups struggle to influence and control debates over climate change risk and coastal erosion risk reduction. By examining the proliferation of contested risk definitions and risk reduction strategies in Louisiana, I aim to provide new insight into the organizational and institutional forces that shape positions on risk, the political-economic forces that create and allocate risk, and the social construction of community identity and culture through risk debates.	climate change; coastal restoration; decision-making; louisiana; organizations and institutions; risk	2016	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91762363	228372	2021.19245	Offshore wind turbine operations and maintenance: A state-of-the-art review	Operations and maintenance of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) play an important role in the development of offshore wind farms. Compared with operations, maintenance is a critical element in the levelized cost of energy, given the practical constraints imposed by offshore operations and the relatively high costs. The effects of maintenance on the life cycle of an offshore wind farm are highly complex and uncertain. The selection of maintenance strategies influences the overall efficiency, profit margin, safety, and sustainability of offshore wind farms. For an offshore wind project, after a maintenance strategy is selected, schedule planning will be considered, which is an optimization problem. Onsite maintenance will involve complex marine operations whose efficiency and safety depend on practical factors. Moreover, negative environmental impacts due to offshore maintenance deserve attention. To address these issues, this paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on OWT maintenance, covering strategy selection, schedule optimization, onsite operations, repair, assessment criteria, recycling, and environmental concerns. Many methods are summarized and compared. Limitations in the research and shortcomings in industrial development of OWT operations and maintenance are described. Finally, promising areas are identified with regard to future studies of maintenance strategies.	offshore wind turbine; operation and maintenance; maintenance strategy; onsite maintenance; maintenance scheduling; environmental issues	2021	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762377	345227	2022.16772	Artificial hard-substrate colonisation in the offshore Nywind Scotland Pilot Park	Artificial substrates associated with renewable offshore energy infrastructure, such as floating offshore wind farms, enable the establishment of benthic communities with a taxonomic composition similar to that of naturally occurring rocky intertidal habitats. The size of the biodiversity impact and the structural changes in benthic habitats will depend on the selected locations. The aim of the study is to assess colonisation and zonation, quantify diversity and abundance, and identify any non-indigenous species present within the wind farm area, as well as to describe changes in the epifouling growth between 2018 and 2020, with regards to coverage and thickness. This article is based on work undertaken within the offshore floating Hywind Scotland Pilot Park, the first floating offshore wind park established in the world, located approximately 25 km east of Peterhead, Scotland. The floating pilot park is situated in water depths of approximately 120 m, with a seabed characterised predominantly by sand and gravel substrates with occasional patches of mixed sediments. The study utilised a work class remotely operated vehicle with a mounted high-definition video camera, deployed from the survey vessel M/V Stril Explorer. A total of 41 structures, as well as their associated sub-components, including turbines substructures, mooring lines, suction anchors and infield cables, were analysed with regards to diversity, abundance, colonisation, coverage and zonation. This approach provides comprehensive coverage of whole structures in a safe and time-saving manner. A total of 11 phyla with 121 different taxa were observed, with macrofauna as well as macroalgae and filamentous algae being identified on the different structures. The submerged turbines measured approximately 80 m in height and exhibited distinct patterns of zonation. Plumose anemones (Metridium senile) and tube-building fan worms (Spirobranchus sp.) dominated the bottom and mid-sections (80-20 m) of the turbines, while kelp and other Phaeophyceae with blue mussels (Mytilus spp.) dominated top sections of the turbines (20-0 m). A general increase in the coverage of the epifouling growth between 2018 and 2020 was observed, whereas the change in thickness between years was more variable.

91762378	298558	2021.3053	Active restoration leads to rapid recovery of aboveground biomass but limited recovery of fish diversity in planted mangrove forests of the North Brazil Shelf	Coastal degradation has spurred active restoration of mangrove ecosystems, from local initiatives to global commitments to increase mangrove forest area by 20% over the next decade. Mangrove restoration projects typically have multiple objectives, including carbon storage, coastal resilience, and fisheries recovery. How planting seedlings, the most common form of active restoration, can promote recovery of mangrove ecosystem functions remains an urgent research need. We quantified multiple ecosystem outcomes of Guyana's national mangrove restoration program, approximately a decade after seedling planting, and compared restoration outcomes with conditions in intact and degraded mangrove forests. Multivariate analyses indicate that intact and restored sites' environmental conditions were similar to each other but different from degraded sites. Aboveground biomass in restored sites (103 Mg haâˆ’1) was 13 and 99% greater than intact (89.4Â Mg haâˆ’1) and degraded (0.12 Mg haâˆ’1) sites, respectively. Active restoration successfully increased seedling abundance of both planted and unplanted species, with similar abundance between intact and restored sites. In contrast, fish communities in restored sites remained similar to degraded sites. Restored sites were dominated by a single algivorous fish species, with lower species diversity and commercially valuable fisheries than intact sites. Our results demonstrate that active restoration is a viable option to restore mangrove forest tree biomass and tree species composition in this region. However, even under a best-case scenario for mangrove forest restoration, fisheries did not recover during our study's timespan. Long-term monitoring and controlled experiments will be essential to further understand restoration outcomes for multiple ecosystem services in mangrove forests.

91762397	8387	2022.1176	Risk communication and capacity-building: A case study on framing CBA strategies of artisanal fishing communities to sea-level rise using BASIEC	Accelerated rise in sea levels due to changing climate threatens the communities located in the low-lying coastal regions. Small-scale fishing communities such as artisanal fishing communities are vulnerable to the risk of sealevel rise. Climate services are considered to be effective instruments to communicate such risks and enhance the capacity of local communities. However, the application of climate services to build capacities of artisanal fishing communities remains sparse. In this context, this study attempted to address the risk of rising sea levels and building capacity of artisanal fishing communities of Ennore region in Chennai situated on the east coast of India, as a case study. The study has addressed the following research questions: What sea-level rise risk information is required? How should it be communicated effectively? and how efficiently climate services can be utilized to enhance the capacities of communities to rising sea levels? BASIEC coastal climate service framework methodology has been adopted. Sea-level rise risk campaign and adaptation workshops were served as climate service platforms to create awareness through narratives and visualization techniques as risk information, communication and education strategies. By adopting participatory techniques such as citizen science and pair-wise ranking methods, the study has identified and prioritized community-based adaptation strategies to sea-level rise. As a climate service, this case study provides a model to communicate the sea-level rise risk and build capacities of artisanal fishing communities in adaptation decision-making. The approach and methodology of this study are valuable for facilitating climate services to empower coastal communities.	sea-level rise; climate services; risk communication; capacity-building; artisanal fishing communities; community-based adaptation	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762413	56079	2022.5714	A Review of National Monitoring Requirements to Support Offshore Carbon Capture and Storage	There is an urgent need to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. One method of achieving this is through Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Geological structures that lie offshore under continental shelf seas offer huge CCS storage potential. An emerging marine industry is developing to exploit this potential and national marine monitoring agencies will soon need to consider the potential impacts of this emerging industry. This review of published literature is aimed at generalists responsible for the delivery of national marine monitoring, as well as those involved in the management of the marine environment. It briefly summarizes why the emerging offshore CCS industry is needed, how large it may be and what marine infrastructure may be involved. For the purposes of this paper, a hypothetical 20 Mtpa industry has been used to gauge the potential impact of a developing offshore CCS industry. The probability of CO2 leaks from such an industry is low. If they do occur, the spatial scale of impact will be small, and the potential environmental impacts will be low. Irrespective of how CO2 is transported or stored within shelf seas, leaked CO2 will enter the sea as a gas or as a solution dissolved in sediment pore water. CO2 as a gas will dissolve into seawater and/or directly vent to the atmosphere, depending on the initial conditions of the leak. The most probable source of leaks in a developed CCS industry is from pipelines (currently a 2-year event per 1000 km pipeline). The most probable source of leakage from geological storage is through abandoned wells (a 20- to 80-year event for a 20 Mtpa industry). The source of leaks from a CCS scheme with the potential to release the greatest mass of CO2 is through geological faults, as these may go undetected (if they occur) for long periods. The probability of leaks from geological storage, through faults or abandoned wells, is site dependent and minimized by the site selection process. The review concludes with recommended priorities for future marine science development.	carbon capture and storage; monitoring; impact assessment; co2; carbonate system	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Nature-based flood defence has been proposed as a sustainable and effective solution to protect coastlines. However, the ability of natural ecosystems to withstand major storms like tropical hurricanes has yet to be thoroughly tested. Seagrass meadows both stabilise sediment and attenuate waves, providing effective coastal protection services for sandy beaches. To examine the tolerance of Caribbean seagrass meadows to extreme storm events, and to investigate the extent of protection they deliver to beaches, we employed a combination of field surveys, biomechanical measurements and wave modelling simulations. Field surveys of seagrass meadows before and after a direct hit by the category 5 Hurricane Irma documented that established seagrass meadows ofThalassia testudinumremained unaltered after the extreme storm event. The flexible leaves and thalli of seagrass and calcifying macroalgae inhabiting the meadows were shown to sustain the wave forces that they are likely to experience during hurricanes. In addition, the seagrass canopy and the complex biogeomorphic landscape built by the seagrass meadows combine to significantly dissipate extreme wave forces, ensuring that erosion is minimised within sandy beach foreshores. The persistence of the Caribbean seagrass meadows and their coastal protection services during extreme storm events ensures that a stable coastal ecosystem and beach foreshore is maintained in tropical regions.	seagrass ecology; tropical ecosystems; natural disturbance; thalassia; cyclone; hurricane	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Here, we explore a flexible method for estimating physical adaptation costs along the San Francisco Bay shoreline. Our goal is to identify uncertainties that can hinder cooperation and decision-making. We categorized shoreline data, estimated the height of exceedance for sea level rise scenarios, and developed a set of unit costs for raising current infrastructure to meet future water levels. Using these cost estimates, we explored critical strategic planning questions, including shoreline positions, design heights, and infrastructure types. For shoreline position, we found that while the shortest line is in fact the least costly, building the future shoreline at today's transition from saltwater to freshwater vegetation is similar in cost but allows for the added possibility of conserving saltwater wetlands. Regulations requiring a specific infrastructure design height above the water level had a large impact on physical construction costs, increasing them by as much as 200\%. Finally, our results show that the costs of raising existing walls may represent 70\% to 90\% of the total regional costs, suggesting that a shift to earthen terraces and levees will reduce adaptation costs significantly.	sea level rise; coastal flooding; cost estimation; adaptation; coastal realignment; climate change; coastal planning; coastal management; san francisco bay; levees; seawalls	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In particular, the main types of floating wind generators and marine current turbines are described. Over time, some of these floating generators have evolved in various hybrid modalities, integrating different generation devices into the same system, wind turbines, marine current turbines, wave energy converters, etc., with the objective of multiplying their generation capacity and optimizing the investment made in the floating system. However, this hybridization offers, in some cases, an opportunity to address the problem of controlling the structural stability of the system. Such stability enhancement has been considered a major challenge since the early days of floating wind turbine design. With this objective, in this work, a specific solution is proposed, consisting of a floating hybrid system composed of a wind generation subsystem and a generation subsystem with two marine current turbines. This proposal allows the development of an integrated control system which deals simultaneously with the structural stability of the system and the optimization of the generation capacity. Additionally, other requirements are also highlighted relating to the achievement of economic viability objectives, considering the reliability and availability of the system in the particularly aggressive marine environment, where maintenance operations are especially costly. In this sense, a model of intelligent integration of the tasks of supervision, diagnosis, and predictive maintenance is proposed.

91762480	243326	2021.6029	Ecological engineering with oysters enhances coastal resilience efforts	Coastal areas are especially vulnerable to habitat loss, sea-level rise, and other climate change effects. Oyster-dominated eco-engineered reefs have been promoted as integral components of engineered habitats enhancing coastal resilience through provision of numerous ecological, morphological, and socio-economic services. However, the assessed `success' of these eco-engineered oyster reefs remains variable across projects and locations, with their general efficacy in promoting coastal resilience, along with related services, often mixed at best. Understanding factors influencing the success of these eco-engineered habitats as valuable coastal management tools could greatly inform related future efforts. Here, we review past studies incorporating reef-building oysters for coastal resilience and enhanced ecosystem services. Our aims are to better understand their utility and limitations, along with critical knowledge gaps to better advance future applicability. Success depends largely on site selection, informed by physical, chemical and biological factors, and adjacent habitats and bottom types. Better understanding of oyster metapopulation dynamics, tolerance and adaptation to changing conditions, and interactions with adjacent habitats will help to better identify suitable locations, and design more effective eco-engineered reefs. These eco-engineered reefs provide a useful tool to assist in developing coastal resilience in the face of climate change and sea level rise.

91762495	260168	2017.1784	The challenge of integrating offshore wind power in the US electric grid. Part II: Simulation of electricity market operations	The purpose of this two-part study is to analyze large penetrations of offshore wind power into a large electric grid, using the case of the grid operated by PJM Interconnection in the northeastern U.S. Part I of the study introduces the wind forecast error model and Part II, this paper, describes Smart-ISO, a simulator of PJM's planning process for generator scheduling, including day-ahead and intermediate-term commitments to energy generators and real-time economic dispatch. Results show that, except in summer, an unconstrained transmission grid can meet the load at five build-out levels spanning 7â€“70Â GW of capacity, with the addition of at most 1â€“8Â GW of reserves. In the summer, the combination of high load and variable winds is challenging. The simulated grid can handle up through build-out level 3 (36Â GW of offshore wind capacity), with 8Â GW of reserves and without any generation shortage. For comparison, when Smart-ISO is run with perfect forecasts, all five build-out levels, up to 70Â GW of wind, can be integrated in all seasons with at most 3Â GW of reserves. This reinforces the importance of accurate wind forecasts. At build-out level 3, energy from wind would satisfy between 11 and 20% of the demand for electricity and settlement prices could be reduced by up to 24%, though in the summer peak they could actually increase by up to 6%. CO2 emissions are reduced by 19â€“40%, SO2 emissions by 21â€“43%, and NOx emissions by 13â€“37%. This study finds that integrating up to 36Â GW of offshore wind is feasible in the PJM grid with today's generation fleet and planning policies, with the addition of 8Â GW of reserves. Above that, PJM would require additional investments in fast-ramping gas turbines, storage for smoothing fast-ramping events, and/or other strategies such as demand response.

Accretion of sediment and biomass enables tidal marshes and swamps to grow vertically, providing a degree of resilience to rising sea levels. Even if accelerating sea level rise overcomes this vertical resilience, tidal habitats have the potential to migrate inland as they continue to occupy land that falls within the new tide range elevations. The existence of developed land inland of tidal habitats, however, may prevent this migration as efforts are often made to dyke and protect developments. To test the importance of inland migration to maintaining tidal habitat abundance under a range of potential rates of sea level rise, we developed a spatially explicit elevation tracking and habitat switching model, dubbed the Marsh Accretion and Inundation Model (MAIM), which incorporates elevation-dependent net land surface elevation gain functions. We applied the model to the metropolitan Washington, DC region, finding that the abundance of small National Park Service units and other public open space along the tidal Potomac River system provides a refuge to which tidal habitats may retreat to maintain total habitat area even under moderate sea level rise scenarios (0.7 m and 1.1 m rise by 2100). Under a severe sea level rise scenario associated with ice sheet collapse (1.7 m by 2100) habitat area is maintained only if no development is protected from rising water. If all existing development is protected, then 5%, 10%, and 40% of the total tidal habitat area is lost by 2100 for the three sea level rise scenarios tested.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.	article;  controlled study;  environmental erosion;  environmental management;  environmental protection;  inland migration;  land protection;  marsh;  marsh accretion and inundation model;  mathematical computing;  migration;  model;  sea level rise;  sedimentation;  swamp;  tidal habitat maintenance;  united states;  validation study;  biomass;  ecosystem;  environmental protection;  greenhouse effect;  natural resource;  procedures;  sea;  theoretical model;  tsunami, biomass;  conservation of natural resources;  ecosystem;  global warming;  models, theoretical;  natural resources;  oceans and seas;  tidal waves	2016	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Individual design and installation steps are represented with bottom-up engineering models that compute times and costs associated with the process; furthermore, operational constraints are assigned to each process so that delays caused by weather and presence of marine mammals may be accounted for in the overall project timeline. The model structure, assumptions, inputs, and results are vetted with industry partners and compared against actual projects for validation. Installation times show reasonable agreement with real data. Project cost sensitivities are investigated to compute the system-level impact of different design choices. First, individual vessel efficiencies are computed for varying numbers of installation vessels and weather time series to show the diminishing returns of more than two feeder barges. Then, array cable capital costs and installation times are determined for a representative project with different turbine sizes. These values quantify the cost-benefit tradeoffs and show a net-cost savings of decreasing numbers of turbines, increased turbine spacing, and fewer turbine terminations. These results demonstrate that the balance of system model features the accuracy, functionality, and accessibility to serve as the foundation for a wide range of analyses to identify cost reduction potentials for offshore wind energy in the United States.

One area of the city that has a high level of vulnerability to these changes is the settlement that is located around the riverbank area. It is generally identified as slums that have irregular settlement patterns, unsuitable housing conditions and not equipped with infrastructure and facilities of settlements adequate, which cause the settlements can't survive when the floods occurred. Manado City as the capital of North Sulawesi Province, according to Decree of Mayor of Manado Number 163 of 2015 on Determination of Slum Area, there are 13 slum areas around the river border with high flood vulnerability level. Recorded in January 2014 there has been a massive flood in Manado that caused damage and huge losses and even casualties in these areas. This is due to irregular settlements and lack of infrastructure. This study was conducted in one of the slum-heavy at Sindulang Satu District covering aspects of land use analysis, river and coastal boundary conditions, building conditions and disaster mitigation infrastructure systems (river embankments, drainage channels, circulation systems and evacuation routes, green open spaces, electricity, etc). The results show that the boundary area of the river needs to be restructured, the river embankment and drainage channel are repaired, the high density of the building needs to be reduced to provide sufficient open spaces, the need to build disaster evacuation routes, improved building conditions and provide an alternative source of electricity and clean water so that if there is a disaster then the area can survive.	flood mitigation; resilience; slum upgrading	2018	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762526	242941	2021.10996	Enabling nature-based solutions for climate change on a peri-urban sandspit in Christchurch, New Zealand	Barrier sandspits are biodiverse natural features that regulate the development of lagoon systems and are popular areas for human settlement. Despite many studies on barrier island dynamics, few have investigated the impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) on sandspits. In peri-urban settings, we hypothesised that shoreline environment change would be strongly dependent on contemporary land use decisions, whilst modern engineering capabilities also present new opportunities for working with nature. Our study site in Christchurch, New Zealand, included a unique example of SLR caused by tectonic subsidence and an associated managed retreat initiative. We used a novel scenario modelling approach to evaluate both shorelines simultaneously for 0.25m SLR increments and incorporating open coast sediment supply in 25-year periods. Our key questions addressed the potential impacts of shoreline change on open coast dune and estuarine-coast saltmarsh ecosystems and implications for the role of `nature-based' climate change solutions. The results identify challenges for dune conservation, with a third of the dune system eliminated in the `1-m SLR in 100-year' scenario. The associated exposure of urban areas to natural hazards such as extreme storms and tsunami will likely fuel demand for seawalls unless natural alternatives can be enabled. In contrast, the managed retreat initiative on the backshore presents an opportunity to restart saltmarsh accretion processes seaward of coastal defences with the potential to reverse decades of degradation. Considering both shorelines simultaneously highlights the existence of pinch-points from opposing forces that result in small land volumes above the tidal range. Societal adaptation is delicately poised between the paradigms of resisting or accommodating nature and challenged by the long perimeter and confined nature of the sandspit feature. The use of innovative policy measures in disaster recovery contexts, as highlighted here, may offer a beneficial framework for enabling nature-based solutions to climate change and natural hazards.YY	natural hazards; natural features; social-ecological systems; shoreline management; climate change adaptation; slr	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762530	234244	2016.4936	A dynamic ocean management proposal for the Bering Strait region	Global climate change is raising Arctic temperatures, warming ocean waters, and melting sea ice at unprecedented rates, creating new opportunities for industry and development and new risks. As industries and local communities become increasingly active in newly accessible Arctic waters, a robust and dynamic regulatory regime is needed to reduce safety and environmental risks and balance competing needs of multiple resource user groups, all while continually adapting to rapidly changing environmental, economic, and social conditions. Such governance is particularly necessary in the narrow Bering Strait, where humans and animals compete for space while transiting between Pacific and Arctic Oceans, and where traditional subsistence uses overlap with emerging industries. Dynamic ocean management, a system of resource management that incorporates real-time data to implement spatially and temporally targeted management responses, offers guidance on the benefits and drawbacks of dynamic regulation and best practices for implementation in the Bering Strait. Examples of successful dynamic management regimes exist and are reviewed and used to illustrate benefits and challenges of dynamic multi-resource management in the Bering Strait region. Dynamic regulation has the potential to improve efficiency in achieving economic and environmental outcomes, although substantial stakeholder engagement may be required to identify precise goals and weigh trade-offs. Significant investment in data collection, analysis, and distribution may also be necessary. However, writing incident-based regulations and management thresholds to create incentives for government and private sector action should enable the Bering Strait region to develop a robust governance system able to adapt to the region's on-going changes.	arctic; adaptive governance; climate change; conservation; dynamic management; shipping	2016	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91762538	8615	2016.665	Cascading effects of cyclones on the biodiversity of Southwest Pacific islands	Human induced climate change is having a dramatic impact on global biodiversity and insular assemblages are particularly vulnerable. However, the cascading impacts of tropical cyclones on insular ecosystems are poorly understood and expected to grow with the increasing intensity of these events associated with future anthropogenic climate change. This problem is particularly relevant to islands of the Southwest Pacific, which are cyclone prone and support high levels of endemic biodiversity. In this perspective, we present new information from a case study of the indirect effects of a tropical cyclone (Ita) on forest extent and integrity from an endemic hotspot, the Louisiade Archipelago of Papua New Guinea. We highlight how a cyclone event can be a catalyst for human coping strategies that increase pressures on forest ecosystems and expose them to invasive plant species. These changes represent a major threat to forest-dependent bird species, many of which are endemic. Rather than being an isolated example, these observations provide an insight into human responses to climate change over cyclone-prone tropical islands/regions where human populations are reliant upon subsistence agriculture and the resources provided by forests. The cumulative anthropogenic impacts on forest ecosystems are potentially catastrophic to the future of island biodiversity and greater than the long-term shifts in mean climate.

91762542	385074	2021.16823	Threading a moving needle: The spatial dimensions characterizing US offshore wind policy drivers	The Atlantic Coast of the United States represents one of the most promising development environments for offshore wind installation in the world due to the convergence of several geographic factors. These include, but are not limited to, population size and density, electricity prices, ocean depth, wind speed, and the dynamics of the region's current energy infrastructures. However, these have not been sufficient to kickstart a mass movement to offshore energy generation despite two decades of affirmative discussions and some entrepreneurial starts. Planned projects now total over 6 GW. Presently, market variables and institutional controls have become more hospitable for development though undertested except in small pilot projects. Socio-cultural concerns including interaction with the fishers, coastal tourism and real estate, Native American Tribes, and environmental and aesthetic factors have been studied, but applicable information remains limited to reliance on comparisons with European offshore wind research, hypothetical analyses, and attention to small pilot projects. This gap as well as a fundamentally differentiated patchwork of state and local stages means that the current research direction will need to be extended through the development of the first utility-scale projects with attention to new case studies as well as new perspectives, framings, and questions. This report outlines important physical and social policy factors of offshore wind development and then explores several case studies.

91762544	27005	2022.3065	Feasibility Study of Harnessing Low Wind Speed Turbine as Hybrid Power Source for Offshore Platforms	In this study, the viability of harnessing wind energy for offshore oil and gas (O\&G) platforms as a micro-grid solution in low wind speed regions to power O\&G platforms is explored. However, wind, as a renewable energy, is known to be highly variable and is unable to provide standalone power reliably within a micro-grid solution due to the variation of the wind speed at hub height, which subsequently leads to a variation of the power outcome. Here, a hybrid power generation concept is developed in which one gas turbine generator (GTG) is replaced with a floating horizontal axis wind turbine (WT) system. By setting up this system, the reduction of the maintenance costs of the GTGs and the reduction of fuel gas consumption reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In addition to this, the fuel gas savings in terms of the business side of such a solution provide a positive revenue impact. In this feasibility study, a technical framework is developed, followed by an economic framework. In the technical framework, wind assessments are performed to obtain the annual energy production for the selected field. Furthermore, an economic framework is established for both conventional and hybrid concepts in two scenarios: greenfield and brownfield, where the incremental net present value (NPV) and levelized cost of energy are calculated. The resultant difference in NPV for hybrid power generation compared to conventional power generation was found to be between 22\% and 37\%. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for WT is USD 165.52/MWh, which is 39\% lower than for conventional, gas turbine-only operations. The LCOE for the hybrid approach is lower than for the conventional scenario by 22\%. In conclusion, the hybrid micro-grid concept solution can harness wind energy from low wind regions with better economic benefits compared to conventional methods through the proper selection of the WT system, its floating substructure, and efficient micro-grid system for powering oil and gas platforms.	low wind speed; levelized cost of energy; hybrid power generation; floating wind turbine; offshore wind	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762553	227368	2009.7135	Spatial planning of offshore wind farms: A windfall to marine environmental protection?	Wind farms are often planned offshore where wind conditions are favourable and the visual impact is less important. Wind farms have both positive and negative effects on the marine environment. Negative effects include bird collisions, underwater sounds and electromagnetic fields, whilst positive effects constitute functioning as artificial reef and acting as no-take zones for fish, with possible spill-over effects. This paper presents a spatially explicit framework to analyze effects of wind farms on the marine environment and aims to evaluate how wind farms can contribute to protection of the marine environment through strategic and economically viable location choices. The functioning and the applicability of the model are demonstrated in a numerical example for the Dutch exclusive economic zone. We find that the careful spatial planning of wind farms is a key factor for profitability and environmental protection, and that, if carefully planned, the environment can benefit from offshore wind farms.

Before countries pour trillions of dollars of investment, this study is commissioned as the first attempt to investigate the economics of offshore marinised charging stations for enabling long-distance shipping by full-electric vessels. Three offshore power generation technologies, namely, wind, solar, and floating nuclear power plants, are compared to demonstrate the economics of offshore charging stations. Compared to conventional vessels using bunker fuels, full-electric vessels are cost competitive even under the assumed first-of-a-kind costs. Among the three offshore power sources compared in this study, a marinised charging station with floating nuclear power plant is shown to be the most cost-competitive. Despite the absence of a pilot project, the technoeconomic parameters as assumed in this study serve as important reference indicators for decision makers to consider when building an ecosystem for sustainable international shipping.	marinised offshore charging station; cost benefit analysis; offshore renewable energy; floating nuclear power plant; international shipping; electric vehicle	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In this paper, a review of Structural Health Monitoring Systems (SHMS) for offshore wind turbines (OWT) has been carried out considering the topic as a Statistical Pattern Recognition problem. Therefore, each one of the stages of this paradigm has been reviewed focusing on OWT application. These stages are: Operational Evaluation; Data Acquisition, Normalization and Cleansing; Feature Extraction and Information Condensation; and Statistical Model Development. It is expected that optimizing each stage, SHMS can contribute to the development of efficient Condition-Based Maintenance Strategies. Optimizing this strategy will help reduce labor costs of OWTs' inspection, avoid unnecessary maintenance, identify design weaknesses before failure, improve the availability of power production while preventing wind turbines' overloading, therefore, maximizing the investments' return. In the forthcoming years, a growing interest in SHM technologies for OWT is expected, enhancing the potential of offshore wind farm deployments further offshore. Increasing efficiency in operational management will contribute towards achieving UK's 2020 and 2050 targets, through ultimately reducing the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE). Â© 2016 The Authors.

91762584	2869	2022.420	Coastal marshes provide valuable protection for coastal communities from storm-induced wave, flood, and structural loss in a changing climate	Wetlands such as tidal marshes and mangroves are known to buffer coastal communities from wave, flood, and structural loss during storms. Coastal communities and resource managers seek to understand the ecosystem service value of coastal wetlands for reducing storm-induced flood loss in a changing climate. A recent modeling study found that a tall and dense Phragmites-dominated Piermont Marsh reduced the flood loss in the Village of Piermont, New York, U.S.A. during Superstorm Sandy and the 1\% annual chance flood and wave event by 8\% and 11\%, respectively. Here we used the same modeling approach to examine the marsh's buffering capacity in a changing climate (from 2020 to 2100), considering a potential marsh restoration plan (from 2020 to 2025) and potential marsh loss due to sea-level rise. Results showed that from 2020 to 2100, the 1\% annual chance flood, wave, and structural loss would increase due to sea-level rise, storms, and marsh loss. However, the marsh will buffer similar to 11-12\% of structural loss until 2050. Under the extreme SLR scenario of 2.89 m and a low accretion rate, Piermont Marsh is expected to lose its buffering capacity by 2080-2100 but will retain some buffering capacity with a high accretion rate of 10 mm/year and marsh growth. The marsh's buffering capacity will remain during extra-tropical storms during winter and spring unless the wind has a significant northerly component. Lessons learned from this study can be used by coastal communities and marsh managers to develop coastal resiliency and marsh restoration plan.

However, while climate adaptation planning has become more open to public input, these processes still do not ensure equitable outcomes. This study examined equity concerning climate adaptation planning processes in New York City with a focus on the relationship between community-based organizations and participatory planning. The two planning processes studied here were the OneNYC comprehensive resilience plan and the Zoning for Coastal Flood Resiliency policy. 57 organizations responded to a survey investigating awareness of, participation in, and barriers to engagement with planning. These variables were compared to characteristics of each organization such as the issues they work on and the demographics of their local community boards. This study provides both quantitative and qualitative data demonstrating the roles that community-based organizations have played in climate adaptation planning in New York City. The results of the study demonstrated the existence of multiple barriers to engagement such as the absence of clarity about ongoing processes and a low understanding of how a climate adaptation plan may help an organization achieve its goals. This study has demonstrated that climate change adaptation planning processes should be revised in multiple ways to increase climate justice. The proposed changes are urgently needed because without equitable processes, there will be significant gaps in any cities' climate resilience.	climate adaptation planning; climate justice; coastal resilience; local climate policy; participatory planning	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762597	8893	2017.735	Facing the future: Conservation as a precursor for building coastal territorial cohesion and resilience	1. On a global scale, most of the coastal zones in the world are undergoing rapid and accelerating changes. This coastal syndrome combines two major trends: one linked to the growth of coastal populations, habitat, transport and industrial infrastructures (assets); the other linked to the influence of climate change and its effects in terms of sea-level rise, increased frequency of extreme weather events, acidification and increase in ocean surface temperature, both affecting the health of coastal ecosystems. This situation is also reflected in the increase in coastal engineering solutions, which have significant impacts on coastal hydrodynamics and natural ecosystems. This extremely dynamic context calls for an evolution in conservation and spatial planning strategies in order to better anticipate changes that may affect not only the sustainability of both the distribution and health of natural ecosystems, but also the relevance of conservation efforts. Marine and coastal protected areas help preserve ecological services, and reduce the risks faced by coastal communities. Therefore, it can be argued that the effectiveness of these conservation units will depend on the ability, (i) to take into account their territorial context, and also (ii) to base the management decisions on a prospective and sufficiently anticipated (future-oriented) approach. MPA management must be proactive to cope with such rapid changes. The Nexus approach, promoted by the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management - coastal ecosystem group (CEM/CEG), places marine and coastal spatial planning as a key integrative element linking conservation, adaptation to climate change and coastal risk reduction, and as a part of no-regret adaptation strategies. This paper highlights the main factors that characterize current coastal dynamics, and then briefly presents three future-oriented pilot operations, implemented in Western Africa at different scales. These operations illustrate how MPAs must become structuring elements for the organization and development of coastal territories if they are to contribute to the resilience of coastal systems and to ensure their own long-term sustainability.	biodiversity hotspot; climate change; coastal; ecosystem approach	2017	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
91762603	8980	2022.1244	Maximising resilience to sea-level rise in urban coastal ecosystems through systematic conservation planning	Coastal cities and their natural environments are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, especially sea-level rise (SLR). Hard coastal defences play a key role in protecting at-risk urban coastal populations from flooding and erosion, but coastal ecosystems also play important roles in the overall sustainability and resilience of cities and urban centres by contributing to coastal protection. Conserving coastal ecosystems and maximising their resilience will ensure that urban coastal communities can continue to benefit from ecosystem services and improve their adaptive capacity to cope with adverse impacts in the future. Using the hyper-urbanised coast of Singapore as a case study, we modelled the resilience of coastal wetlands to SLR and integrated resilience in conservation plan-ning. We found that the responses of coastal habitats to rising sea level vary across the modelling periods. While there is a slight net gain in the extent of mangrove forests and tidal flats by the end of the century due to potential habitat conversion, the existing habitats will experience a loss in coverage. Highly modified coastlines associated with urbanisation impede the ability of existing wetlands to migrate landward, which is a key mechanism for coastal habitats to cope with rising sea levels. Systematic conservation planning can identify sites that are potentially resilient to SLR and incorporate factors that influence an ecosystem's capability to respond to change. Crucially, the relatively slow rates of SLR and persistence of coastal wetlands during the earlier half of this century present an opportunity to introduce management interventions aimed at enhancing ecosystem resilience.	climate change; sea -level rise; marxan; slamm; southeast asia; tropical ecosystems; wetlands	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762624	301512	2020.492	Aboveground carbon loss associated with the spread of ghost forests as sea levels rise	Coastal forests sequester and store more carbon than their terrestrial counterparts but are at greater risk of conversion due to sea level rise. Saltwater intrusion from sea level rise converts freshwater-dependent coastal forests to more salt-tolerant marshes, leaving â€˜ghost forestsâ€™ of standing dead trees behind. Although recent research has investigated the drivers and rates of coastal forest decline, the associated changes in carbon storage across large extents have not been quantified. We mapped ghost forest spread across coastal North Carolina, USA, using repeat Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys, multi-temporal satellite imagery, and field measurements of aboveground biomass to quantify changes in aboveground carbon. Between 2001 and 2014, 15% (167 km2) of unmanaged public land in the region changed from coastal forest to transition-ghost forest characterized by salt-tolerant shrubs and herbaceous plants. Salinity and proximity to the estuarine shoreline were significant drivers of these changes. This conversion resulted in a net aboveground carbon decline of 0.13 Â± 0.01 TgC. Because saltwater intrusion precedes inundation and influences vegetation condition in advance of mature tree mortality, we suggest that aboveground carbon declines can be used to detect the leading edge of sea level rise. Aboveground carbon declines along the shoreline were offset by inland aboveground carbon gains associated with natural succession and forestry activities like planting (2.46 Â± 0.25 TgC net aboveground carbon across study area). Our study highlights the combined effects of saltwater intrusion and land use on aboveground carbon dynamics of temperate coastal forests in North America. By quantifying the effects of multiple interacting disturbances, our measurement and mapping methods should be applicable to other coastal landscapes experiencing saltwater intrusion. As sea level rise increases the landward extent of inundation and saltwater exposure, investigations at these large scales are requisite for effective resource allocation for climate adaptation. In this changing environment, human intervention, whether through land preservation, restoration, or reforestation, may be necessary to prevent aboveground carbon loss. Â© 2020 The Author(s).

Although many terms are used to describe shoreline stabilization approaches that protect or enhance the natural shoreline habitat, these approaches are frequently referred to as living shorelines. A review of the literature on living shorelines is provided to determine which insights from locations where living shorelines have proved successful are applicable to the New England shorelines for mitigating shoreline erosion while maintaining coastal ecosystem services. The benefits of living shorelines in comparison with traditional hardened shoreline protection structures are discussed. Nonstructural and hybrid approaches (that is, approaches that include natural or manmade hard structures) to coastal protection are described, and the effectiveness of these approaches in response to waves, storms, and sea-level rise is evaluated.	coastal protection; soft stabilization; natural and nature-based features	2017	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

In attempting to anticipate the needs of a constantly changing future, preservationists need to plan for a range of eventualities, consider new strategies, and determine how these strategies can be tested. Interestingly, appropriate adaptive strategies may exist in past cultural responses to harsh and shifting environments, like our coastal areas and barrier islands. One such historic coastal community, which represents the unique type of heritage and sense of place that preservationists work to protect and is currently at risk due to sea level rise, is Portsmouth Village on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The particular responses and adaptations to a challenging and ever-changing environment, which were developed and adopted by residents of Portsmouth Village to address environmental forces, offer some clues for possible future responses to climate change. This paper examines historical approaches and potential future strategies for the preservation of cultural landscapes and other heritage resources threatened by climate change.

91762652	30196	2017.2165	Green routing design in short seas	In recent years, with the development of shipping industry, the mass of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions originating from ships is also increasing rapidly. To reduce the GHG emissions from ships, designing the optimised routes with higher energy use efficiency is becoming more important for ships navigating in short seas. Based on the innovative application of energy efficiency operational index (EEOI), a route optimisation model is established. To solve the model, we divide one single voyage into several voyage segments and consider the variable speed across voyage segments. Then the navigation strategy is used to find out the sailing route of the minimum EEOI value, this sailing route is called as the green route. Finally, numerical experimental results show that the EEOI values of the experimental groups which used the optimised navigation method are 4.67\%-16.95\% lower than that of the control group. The results demonstrate that the green route designed in this paper can effectively improve the energy use efficiency of ships.	green routing; energy efficiency operational index; eeoi; short seas; discretisation	2017	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762657	3917	2015.277	Design and prototyping of a FRCC modular and climate responsive affordable housing system for underserved people in the pacific island nations	This paper outlines the process of design and prototyping of a modular housing system aimed at serving the needs of people in the Pacific island nations. Many people in these islands are economically challenged and live in sub-standard housing at low elevations, making them vulnerable to increased tropical storms brought about by climate change. A collaborative team comprised of architecture and engineering faculty and students is currently developing a system to address the need for improved housing in the Pacific islands based on the criteria of affordability, customizable design, thermal comfort, durability, sustainability, and local reproducibility. To best address the design criteria, the team reviewed indigenous building and tropical architecture literature, studied climactic factors, formed alternative design strategies, and selected the most promising for further development. A method of using precast fiber-reinforced cementitious composite (FRCC) modular components was chosen, with a limited number of parts to lower unit cost. The assembly was designed to allow homeowners to participate in the construction process, and the house is adaptable by adding or reconfiguring modules. To provide thermal comfort, the design evolved to include shading overhangs, a narrow floor plate, porous walls, and a ridge vent for stack ventilation. Durability is addressed through structural design and material selection. The structure is designed to withstand anticipated hurricane and storm surge events. Local reproducibility is sought by using materials and methods of construction possible with moderate workforce training and minimal capitalization costs. A successful housing system for the Pacific Islands must address cultural, environmental, constructional, and structural factors, and therefore benefits from a collaborative design approach involving both architects and engineers. The proposed system as developed to date appears to be a promising solution to provide affordable, sustainable, and resilient housing for underserved people in the Pacific islands. Pending availability of funding, a first prototype house is slated for construction on a Pacific island site and evaluated for cost, thermal comfort, climate effect resistance, and occupant satisfaction.

91762664	331180	2017.13508	Prospects for generating electricity by large onshore and offshore wind farms	The decarbonisation of energy sources requires additional investments in renewable technologies, including the installation of onshore and offshore wind farms. For wind energy to remain competitive, wind farms must continue to provide low-cost power even when covering larger areas. Inside very large wind farms, winds can decrease considerably from their free-stream values to a point where an equilibrium wind speed is reached. The magnitude of this equilibrium wind speed is primarily dependent on the balance between turbine drag force and the downward momentum influx from above the wind farm. We have simulated for neutral atmospheric conditions, the wind speed field inside different wind farms that range from small (25 km2) to very large (105 km2) in three regions with distinct wind speed and roughness conditions. Our results show that the power density of very large wind farms depends on the local free-stream wind speed, the surface characteristics, and the turbine density. In onshore regions with moderate winds the power density of very large wind farms reaches 1 W m-2, whereas in offshore regions with very strong winds it exceeds 3 W m-2. Despite a relatively low power density, onshore regions with moderate winds offer potential locations for very large wind farms. In offshore regions, clusters of smaller wind farms are generally preferable; under very strong winds also very large offshore wind farms become efficient.

Nine adaptation actions are recommended and if successfully implemented could reduce risks caused by climate change by fifty percent. The mitigating benefits of these actions are expected to cascade into other elements of the Lagoon, like living resources and habitats. The results and recommendations of this investigation are novel because they are based upon site-specific data and anticipated risks prioritized using a repeatable and defensible methodology. Furthermore, the focus and deliverables were informed by stakeholder involvement to facilitate utility to and implementation by resource practitioners. The next challenge is to implement, monitor, and revise each adaptation action as warranted. This will require a substantial increase in funding dedicated to the Lagoon's restoration and coherently managed for decades. Strengthened collaboration between local, state, and federal programs is necessary to enhance the probability of successfully reducing future climate-related water quality impairments and facilitating the emergence of a more resilient, climate-ready estuary.	adaptation action plan; climate ready estuary; florida; indian river lagoon; vulnerability assessment; water quality impairment	2021	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

Much of the country is at risk of coastal flooding due to sea-level rise and from severe weather-related events. The data analyzed were obtained in 2016 and 2018 from focus group discussions with local residents, individual interviews with local government officials, and field observations. Residents' and officials' reports reveal a number of consistent themes in both places and over time, with some important differences. Both locations were grappling with regular minor to moderate flooding in 2016, as well as with occasional severe flooding. Respondents reported serious economic, health, and safety threats associated with flooding events. Recent infrastructure improvements appear to have reduced routine flood risk in one location, but considerable risk from major storms remains in both places. While some housing has been abandoned because of flood damage, and while some better-off residents have moved away, most are not currently considering retreat as a near-term solution. Instead, most people are adapting in place and attempting to devise strategies to mitigate flood risk in their communities.	sea level rise; flood risk; adaptation; philippines; migration; retreat; protection motivation theory	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Erosion which is accelerated by sea level rise may also increase the vulnerability to storm damage by decreasing the distance between the shore and structures, and by eroding protective coastal features (dunes). We present methods of assessing this storm damage in coastal regions where structural protection is not pursued. Starting from the bounding cases of no foresight and perfect foresight of Yohe et al. (1996), we use a disaggregated analysis which models the random nature of storms, and models market valuation and private investor decisions dynamically. Using data from the National Flood Insurance Program and a hypothetical community, we estimate that although the total storm damage can be large, the increase in storm damage attributable to sea level rise is small (<5\% of total sea level rise damages). These damages, however, could become more significant under other reasonable assumptions or where dune erosion increases storm damage.

In particular, this principle should be taken into account in the logistical processes related to manufacture and transport. This study assesses the global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand (CED) of developing a coastal ecosystem enhancement programme in the estuary region of Galicia, northwestern Spain. The focus is on the processes involved in creating green artificial reefs (GARs): manufacture, transport and installation. The starting point is the supply chain for the green artificial reef (GAR) units; greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and energy needs for each phase are analysed. Various scenarios are considered to determine which options are indeed available when it comes to establishing the supply chain. Different types of energy supplies, different options for the location of production centres, as well as different means of transport were studied. Results reveal the critical phases for selecting how the GAR units must be produced, transported by road and sea and then installed in their permanent location. Â© 2021 by the authors.

91762701	244772	2020.14043	Revealing the dominant discourses of stakeholders towards natural resource management in Port Resolution, Vanuatu, using Q-method	Rural communities in Pacific small island states, which rely directly and acutely on the benefits from ecosystem services, face a range of interlinking threats to their management of natural resources, exacerbated by climate change-related risks, all against the backdrop of rapid social and economic transition. Appropriate and sufficient community adaptation responses are required to maintain habitats and sustain livelihoods. Adaptation responses are mediated through often competing subjective discourses. We used Q-method to reveal discourses within a subsistence community in Vanuatu and amongst associated stakeholders. We revealed three discourses, which we called Strong Kastom, Kastom + Health and Tentative Modernity. When we compared stakeholder socio-demographic attributes we found a statistically significant gender difference between membership of Strong Kastom, which was skewed towards men and Tentative Modernity, which was skewed towards women. We also found that external practitioners were weighted away from Tentative Modernity. Our results suggest ecosystem based adaptations to climate change will likely resonate with the community if they support customary natural resource knowledge and management, and provide opportunities for generating income, and promoting gender equity in decision-making. Our results also suggest external practitioners may not consider income generation to be sufficiently important to community resilience.	climate change adaptation; ecosystem-based adaptation; q-method; natural resource management; gender issues	2020	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762706	298346	2021.4661	Direct air capture of CO2: A response to meet the global climate targets	Highlights: DAC can help deal with difficult to avoid emissions. Large-scale deployment of DAC requires serious government, private, and corporate support and investment particularly to offset the capital cost as well as operational costs. Further optimizations to the costs can be found in choice of energy source as well as advances in CO2 capture technology such as high capacity and selectivity materials, faster reaction kinetics, and ease of reusability. Abstract: Direct air capture (DAC) technologies are receiving increasing attention from the scientific community, commercial enterprises, policymakers and governments. While deep decarbonization of all sectors is required to meet the Paris Agreement target, DAC can help deal with difficult to avoid emissions (aviation, ocean-shipping, iron-steel, cement, mining, plastics, fertilizers, pulp and paper). While large-scale deployment of DAC discussions continues, a closer look to the capital and operational costs, different capture technologies, the choice of energy source, land and water requirements, and other environmental impacts of DAC are reviewed and examined. Cost per ton of CO2 captured discussions of leading industrial DAC developers with their carbon capture technologies are presented, and their detailed cost comparisons are evaluated based on the choice of energy operation together with process energy requirements. Validation of two active plantsâ€™ net negative emission contributions after reducing their own carbon footprint is presented. Future directions and recommendations to lower the current capital and operational costs of DAC are given. In view of large-scale deployment of DAC, and the considerations of high capital costs, private investments, government initiatives, net zero commitments of corporations, and support from the oil companies combined will help increase carbon capture capacity by building more DAC plants worldwide.

Stakeholders in the port industry have gradually started paying attention to emissions and cost issues across all the sectors, such as supply chains. Global biomass supply chain is one of the main sectors which has not been addressed in published literature. To address this gap, this study aims to develop a dynamic full-scale synergy model to assess cost-mass flow, particulate matter emissions, and air pollutants for maritime transportation of the global crude palm oil biomass supply chain. Focusing on leading producers of palm oil worldwide, we have analyzed a total of 93 sea routes from Malaysia and Indonesia to main export markets in the US, Europe, and Asia. The analysis distinguishes three freight categories: light, medium-weight, and heavy for different sizes of capacity and types of container ships based on the twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU). The findings highlight the dependency of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions level on other factors such as technology, size, and mass flow used for container ships. The results also show a strong relationship between GHG emitted and the type of container ship in a systemic view. A ship with higher TEU contributes to the higher transported amount and lower GHG emissions in the long term. To conclude, the results would increase port industry stakeholders' understanding of developing energy policies and managerial strategies for low cost and low carbon fuels technologies.	global biomass supply chain; crude palm oil; maritime transportation; export market; transportation cost; environmental emissions	2021	Devi	Jean-Pierre	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The social benefit is based upon wind power's energy and capacity services and the avoidance of environmental damages. The approach uses probabilistic load duration curves to account for the stochastic interaction between wind power availability, electricity demand, and conventional generator dispatch. The model is applied to potential offshore wind power development to the south of Long Island, NY. If natural gas combined cycle and integrated gasifier combined cycle (IGCC) are the alternative generation sources, wind power exhibits a negative social benefit due to its high capacity cost and the relatively low emissions of these advanced fossil-fuel technologies. Environmental benefits increase significantly if charges for CO2 emissions are included. Results also reveal a diminishing social benefit as wind power penetration increases. The dependence of wind power benefits on CO2 charges, and capital costs for wind turbines and IGCC plant is also discussed. The methodology is intended for use by energy planners in assessing the social benefit of future investments in wind power. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Countries in the region have been affected by several recent catastrophic events, as well as by frequent natural hazards of smaller magnitude. The purpose of this paper is to quantify total disaster risk faced by Pacific island countries (PICs). Design/methodology/approach The paper evaluates the three main sources of data for quantifying risk in the regionthe International Emergency Database (EMDAT), DesInventar and the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative, evaluating the information available on indirect disaster impacts and their likely impacts on poverty and well-being. Findings The analysis suggests that the three available data sets contain inconsistencies and underestimate disaster risk, especially for atoll nations. It also identifies four trends with respect to changes in natural hazards that result from climate change and are likely to have the greatest long-term impact on Pacific islands. Focusing on Tuvalu, the paper also quantifies the likely consequence of some of the possible interventions that aim to reduce those impacts. Practical implications The paper's main conclusion is that improving the systematic collection of quantitative data on disaster events should be a basic first step in improving future policy decisions concerning resource allocation and efforts to insure losses from future disasters and climate change. Originality/value While a lot of research explored disaster risk in PICs, comparative analysis of quantitative information on disasters across the diverse countries of the region is limited.	disaster risk; small island developing states; sids; pacific islands; climate change implications	2018	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Current knowledge on these systems is limited, particularly the economic aspects. Therefore, a new, integrated and analytical model for viability assessment of hydrogen production from dedicated offshore wind farms is developed in this paper. This includes the formulae for calculating wind power output, electrolysis plant size, and hydrogen production from time varying wind speed. All the costs are projected to a specified time using both Discounted Payback (DPB) and Net Present Value (NPV) to consider the value of capital over time. A case study considers a hypothetical wind farm of 101.3 MW situated in a potential offshore wind development pipeline off the East Coast of Ireland. All the costs of the wind farm and the electrolysis plant are for 2030, based on reference costs in the literature. Proton exchange membrane electrolysers and underground storage of hydrogen are used. The analysis shows that the DPB and NPV flows for several scenarios of storage are in good agreement and that the viability model performs well. The offshore wind farm hydrogen production system is found to be profitable in 2030 at a hydrogen price of (sic)5/kg and underground storage capacities ranging from 2 days to 45 days of hydrogen production. The model is helpful for rapid assessment or optimisation of both economics and feasibility of dedicated offshore wind farm - hydrogen production systems. (C) 2020 The Authors.

91762746	6403	2021.833	Designing a blueprint for coral reef survival	Maintaining coral reef ecosystems is a social imperative, because so many people depend on coral reefs for food production, shoreline protection, and livelihoods. The survival of reefs this century, however, is threatened by the mounting effects of climate change. Climate mitigation is the foremost and essential action to prevent coral reef ecosystem collapse. Without it, reefs will become extremely diminished within the next 20-30 years. Even with strong climate mitigation, however, existing conservation measures such as marine protected areas and fisheries management are no longer sufficient to sustain the ecosystem and many additional and innovative actions to increase reef resilience must also be taken. In this paper we assess the suite of protections and actions in terms of their potential to be effective according to a set of criteria that include effectiveness, readiness, cobenefits and disbenefits. Even with the best scientific innovation, saving coral reefs will require a well-funded, well-designed, and rapidly executed strategy with political and social commitments at the level of other grand challenges.	coral reefs; climate change; conservation strategy; ecosystem restoration	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Scenarios of potential changes in coastal flood risk due to changes in climate, society and the economy over the twenty-first century have been analysed using a national-scale quantified flood risk analysis methodology. If it is assumed that there will be no adaptation to increasing coastal flood risk, the expected annual damage in England and Wales due to coastal flooding is predicted to increase from the current 0.5 pound billion to between 1.0 pound and 13.5 pound billion, depending on the scenario of climate and socio-economic change. The proportion of national flood risk that is attributable to coastal flooding is projected to increase from roughly 50\% to between 60 and 70\%. Scenarios of adaptation to increasing risk, by construction of coastal dikes or retreat from coastal floodplains, are analysed. These adaptations are shown to be able to reduce coastal flood risk to between 0.2 pound and MS billion. The capital cost of the associated coastal engineering works is estimated to be between 12 pound and 40 pound billion. Nonstructural measures to reduce risk can make a major contribution to reducing the cost and environmental impact of engineering measures.	coastal flood risk; climate change; socio-economic scenarios; adaptation	2006	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

A comparative analysis of overfishing and coastal governance in Ghana, Tanzania, the Philippines, and Thailand	As coastal communities across the Global South confront the multiple challenges of climate change, overfishing, poverty and other socio-environmental pressures, there is an increasing need to understand diverse coastal governance responses and livelihood trajectories from a comparative perspective. This paper presents a holistic investigation of the pressures coastal communities face in four countries and examines possible meeting points between bottom-up initiatives and top-down policies. We compare the experiences of eight fishing areas in Ghana, Tanzania, Thailand and the Philippines and ask how small-scale fishing communities perceive overfishing and other socio-environmental pressures; what factors determine the success and failure of coastal governance initiatives; and how different initiatives can be made congruent to improve coastal, rural development outcomes. Results from an extensive survey of 835 fisherfolk and semi-structured interviews with 196 key informants show that overfishing remains a significant driver of livelihood trajectories in the communities and that fisherfolk respond through informal mechanisms of collective action. Drawing from these diverse experiences, we propose viewing coastal livelihood trajectories through the integrated dimensions of socio-environmental relationships and coastal governance options and discuss implications that address institutional scalar flexibility, illegal fishing, and persistent marginalisation.	small-scale fisheries; overfishing; socio-environmental pressures; coastal livelihood trajectories; coastal governance	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762767	13996	2020.1735	Climate change adaptation in aquaculture	This study conducts the first systematic literature review of climate change adaptation in aquaculture. We address three specific questions: (i) What is aquaculture adapting to? (ii) How is aquaculture adapting? and (iii) What research gaps need to be addressed? We identify, characterise and examine case studies published between 1990 and 2018 that lie at the intersection of the domains of climate change, adaptation and aquaculture. The main areas of documented climate change impacts relate to extreme events and the general impacts of climate change on the aquaculture sector. Three categories of adaptation to climate change are identified: coping mechanisms at the local level (e.g. water quality management techniques), multilevel adaptive strategies (e.g. changing culture practices) and management approaches (e.g. adaptation planning, community-based adaptation). We identify four potential areas for future research: research on inland aquaculture adaptation; studies at the household level; whether different groups of aquaculture farmers (e.g. indigenous people) face and adapt differently to climate change; and the use of GIS and remote sensing as cost-effective tools for developing adaptation strategies and responses. The study brings essential practical and theoretical insights to the aquaculture industry as well as to climate change adaptation research across the globe.	adaptation; aquaculture; climate change; research directions; systematic literature review	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

Renewable energy sources are naturally occurring, which can help in reducing the dependency on non-renewable resources. The increasing effects of climate change have led to the utilization of renewable energy resources for power generation, among which wind is one of the significant sources of power generation. It provides a reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly alternative contributing to national energy security in the current age of decreasing global reserves of non-renewable resources across the globe. This paper reviews the wind energy technologies used, mainly focusing on the types of turbines used and their future scope. Further, the paper briefly discusses certain future wind generation technologies, namely airborne, offshore, smart rotors, multi-rotors, and other small wind turbine technologies. It also briefly discusses ways to improve the efficiency of different turbine generation technologies, majorly non-conventional ideas of wind turbine technologies based on cross axis wind turbine (CAWT), vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT), magnetic-based wind turbine. Overall, the summarization of wind energy here consists of four aspects: (1) wind turbine structure, (2) wind power generation technologies, (3) wind energy assessment methodologies, (4) limitation of developed technologies and future scope of wind energy development.

91762790	233202	2022.15465	Factors influencing hazard management by municipalities: The case of coastal communities	As climate and anthropogenic changes increase the vulnerability of coastal areas around the world, the threat (and reality) of coastal hazards grows. These threats arise particularly at a local level, calling out for more knowledge on how to best support coastal municipalities to deal with natural and human-induced hazards. This study seeks to add to the understanding through an examination of local-level experience with hazard planning and responses carried out by coastal municipalities, producing insights on how to reduce their vulnerability and support their resilience. It explores the factors influencing coastal municipalities' management of relevant hazards to achieve comprehensive multi-hazard risk reduction and adaptation. We do so through a national survey of Canada's coastal municipalities which assessed experience with hazards, risk perception, hazard prioritization, and the extent and specifics of hazard responses. We characterize the determinants of coastal municipalities' behaviour and intervening factors, and conduct regression analyses to explain coastal municipalities' risk perception, hazard prioritization, implementation of management processes for dealing with hazards, and the number of implemented or planned hazard responses. Six key factors were identified that influence hazard responses at the municipal level: experience with hazards; competing priorities; hazard visibility; access to resources (financial and technical capacity) and governance (institutional setting and political capacity). We conclude that municipal hazard responses can be reinforced by increasing the effectiveness of risk communication, promoting participatory processes, providing support for municipalities' identified needs and priorities, ensuring municipalities have access to relevant information and expertise, and implementing integrated coastal governance and management.	natural hazards; climate change; local government; hazard responses; capacity; canada	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762804	357385	2010.7179	Renewable energy in India: Current status and future potentials	Renewable energy sources and technologies have potential to provide solutions to the long-standing energy problems being faced by the developing countries. The renewable energy sources like wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, ocean energy, biomass energy and fuel cell technology can be used to overcome energy shortage in India. To meet the energy requirement for such a fast growing economy, India will require an assured supply of 3-4 times more energy than the total energy consumed today. The renewable energy is one of the options to meet this requirement. Today, renewable account for about 33% of India's primary energy consumptions. India is increasingly adopting responsible renewable energy techniques and taking positive steps towards carbon emissions, cleaning the air and ensuring a more sustainable future. In India, from the last two and half decades there has been a vigorous pursuit of activities relating to research, development, demonstration, production and application of a variety of renewable energy technologies for use in different sectors. In this paper, efforts have been made to summarize the availability, current status, major achievements and future potentials of renewable energy options in India. This paper also assesses specific policy interventions for overcoming the barriers and enhancing deployment of renewables for the future.

91762818	301696	2020.1791	Insights and guidance for offshore CO2 storage monitoring based on the QICS, ETI MMV, and STEMM-CCS projects	Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a collective term for technologies that allow society to unlock the benefits of energy intensive processes like fertiliser production and combustion of fuels (fossil or biologically sourced) without releasing the CO2 to the atmosphere. Hence, CCS could assist in accelerating decarbonisation while society pursues a just energy transition. This paper aims to summarise the learnings of three research projects that all investigated aspects of marine monitoring for CCS from a CO2 storage operator's perspective. The QICS (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage), ETI MMV (Energy Technologies Institute Measurement, Monitoring and Verification of CO2 Storage), and STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine CCS) projects collectively represent over twelve years of dedicated research to assess environmental impacts and to develop technologies for detection, location, and quantification of potential leakage from offshore geological storage of CO2. Each project used controlled releases in representative environments to test their methods and technologies. QICS as the first of the three projects, focused on the understanding of sensitivities of the UK marine environment to a potential leak from a CO2 storage complex and tested technologies to detect such emissions. The ETI MMV project brought together research and industry partners to develop and sea trial an operational, integrated and cost-effective marine monitoring system for geological CO2 storage. As a commercial project, these results have never been published before and this paper shares for the first-time insights from this work. In February 2020, STEMM-CCS, completed its quest to test techniques for environmental monitoring over a marine CO2 storage site in the UK North Sea, further improved near seabed leakage characterisation capabilities, and delivered a first marine CCS demonstration level ecological baseline. This paper aims to summarise some of the key insights from the three projects and provides references where available for the interested reader. The key finding of all three projects is that the impacts of small to medium CO2 leakages from large-scale storage are limited and localised. Technology capabilities exist for integrated marine CO2 storage monitoring and their performance has been benchmarked at controlled release trials. Even small leakages of 10âˆ’50 L/min can be detected at unknown locations in a large area of interest. Finally, the first important steps towards automated monitoring data analysis have been made, including automated leakage signal detection from Side Scan Sonar data (ETI MMV project) and automated species identification from marine biology images (STEMM-CCS project). Some remaining challenges include missed/false alerts because of large variations in the background signal, the cost of monitoring large areas over long periods, and making real-time decisions based on big data. Continued work to reduce the cost of marine monitoring technologies and advancing automation of data processing and analysis will be important in order to support safe and efficient offshore CCS deployment at large scale.

The study focused on exploring the existing coastal resources and their support to communities' livelihood, climatic threats that are experienced, and the role of coastal resources in enhancing communities' resilience. It further sought to establish other enabling factors for climate change adaptation (e.g., gender, education, governance, by-laws, and membership in social networks). The study used focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and household surveys in data collection. Findings show that Mchungu village is endowed with fish, mangrove, natural canal, and floodplains as their major coastal resources, while Kivinja' A' is rich in salt and coconut production. Communities in both villages exploit these coastal resources for their livelihood activities such as fishing, agriculture, and business. The study further found that coastal communities are already experiencing the effects of climate change through temperature rise, flooding, drought, sea-level rise, and storm surges. These affect household food security in terms of fish catch and crop production. The study revealed that coastal and marine resources were important for increasing community resilience (P <= 0.05) to climate change impacts in the studied villages. However, household resilience to climate change impacts was also influenced by gender, by-laws, education, and membership in social networks.	climate change; resilience; coastal resources; marine resources; coastal communities	NA	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

In order to predict such events or to adapt coastal structures in the future, it is desirable to be able to monitor the action of waves. Thanks to new technologies, one can embed sensors on dykes and have access remotely and continuously to field data measurements. In this paper, an in situ system, installed in September 2014, to measure the wave impact pressure is described. Additionally, the preliminary results of data processing are given.	breakwater; dyke; environmental variable; field data; pressure sensor; seawall; signal processing	2018	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762850	9010	2012.405	Types of cluster adaptation to climate change. Lessons from the port and logistics sector of Northwest Germany	In this article, we argue that sectoral adaptation efforts to climate change, e. g. of the ports sector, are also struggles to reshape economic space according to sectoral needs. Addressing globalisation, the effects on economic spatial hierarchies among regions and the active promotion of regionalisation are seen as important. Applied to the port industry, this allows approaching the fierce competition among European north range ports from an action- and power-oriented perspective. Climate adaptation of ports is predominantly referred to as technical responses to extreme events (e.g. coastal protection). A differentiated conceptualisation (based on still ongoing research), however, also addresses impacts on specific elements of the transport chain, and effects on the spatial function of a port (e.g. the changing competitiveness within the European port system). Hence, the ability of a specific port to adapt will also encompass the management of regional target conflicts, and of multi-level relations. Thus, climate adaptation becomes part of positional struggles in spatial hierarchies among regions and of conflicts about political priorities within them. At the same time, the limits of exclusively regional approaches in addressing sustainability issues without higher level support become evident. The article gives an overview of the literature on climate adaptation and its application to ports and provides a preliminary typology of forms of sectoral adaptation to climate change.

91762855	235424	2015.4827	Coastal sediment elevation change following anthropogenic mangrove clearing	Coastal mangrove forests along tropical shorelines serve as an important interface between land and sea. They provide a physical buffer protecting the coastline from erosion and act as sediment ``traps{'' catching terrestrial sediment, thus preventing smothering of subtidal coral reefs. Coastal development that removes mangrove habitat may impact adjacent nearshore coral reefs through sedimentation and nutrient loading. We examined differences in sediment elevation change between patches of open-coast intact and anthropogenically cleared red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) on the east side of Turneffe Atoll, Belize, to quantify changes following mangrove clearing. Samples were collected over a 24 month period at five study sites, each containing paired intact (+mangrove) and cleared (-mangrove) plots. Five sediment elevation pins were deployed in each plot: behind areas cleared of mangroves (-mangrove) and behind adjacent intact mangroves (+mangrove). Sediment elevation increased at intact mangrove sites (M = +3.83 mm, SE = 0.95) whereas cleared mangrove areas suffered elevation loss (M = -7.30 mm, SE = 3.38). Mangroves inshore of partial or continuous gaps in the adjacent fringing reefs had higher rates of elevation loss (M = -15.05 mm) than mangroves inshore of continuous fringing reefs (M = -1.90 mm). Our findings provide information on potential effects of mangrove clearing and the role of offshore habitat characteristics on coastal sediment trapping and maintenance of sediment elevation by mangroves. With implications for coastline capacity to adjust to sea level rise, these findings are relevant to management of coastal fringing mangrove forests across the Caribbean. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

91762858	60865	2016.3737	Blue Carbon Ecosystems and Their Role in Climate Change Mitigation-An Overview	Blue carbon ecosystems include mangroves and other tidal wetlands such as seagrasses and salt marshes. Coastal blue carbon is thought to provide climate change mitigation benefits in view of their ability to store carbon under adverse conditions and this in the recent times has garnered the attention of the scientific community at large. Mangroves are one of the most productive ecosystems and their carbon storage potential is much greater as compared to sea grasses and salt marshes. Mangroves sequester carbon in their living biomass as well as the sediments. The tropical Asian mangroves show the greatest mangrove diversity and the highest biomass accumulation. But, the carbon storage potential of their living biomass is outcompeted by their sedimentary carbon storage. Mangrove sediments play a special and quantitatively important role in carbon storage than previously thought. They store both autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter due to their strategic location at the interface between land and sea and prevailing reducing conditions. Indian mangrove ecosystems which also comprises one of the largest mangrove forest of the world may offer a possible opportunity for the development of blue carbon market economy. But there exist a large number of gaps in the available blue carbon literature. The available studies largely focus on the living biomass storage and sedimentary storage is un-surveyed. Mangrove research in India have shown significant growth in the past few decades but the targeted approach towards delineating the ecosystems' carbon stocks and the factors controlling them are still lacking. The need of the hour is to correctly map and document the mangroves in India for their carbon storage in order to build a better and reliable picture of the role of these ecosystems in climate change mitigation.	blue carbon; mangroves; climate change; sediments; coastal ecosystems	2016	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762859	8128	2017.673	Making Space for Proactive Adaptation of Rapidly Changing Coasts: A Windows of Opportunity Approach	Coastlines are very often places where the impacts of global change are felt most keenly, and they are also often sites of high values and intense use for industry, human habitation, nature conservation and recreation. In many countries, coastlines are a key contested territory for planning for climate change, and also locations where development and conservation conflicts play out. As a ``test bed{''} for climate change adaptation, coastal regions provide valuable, but highly diverse experiences and lessons. This paper sets out to explore the lessons of coastal planning and development for the implementation of proactive adaptation, and the possibility to move from adaptation visions to actual adaptation governance and planning. Using qualitative analysis of interviews and workshops, we first examine what the barriers are to proactive adaptation at the coast, and how current policy and practice frames are leading to avoidable lock-ins and other maladaptive decisions that are narrowing our adaptation options. Using examples from UK, we then identify adaptation windows that can be opened, reframed or transformed to set the course for proactive adaptation which links high level top-down legislative requirements with local bottom-up actions. We explore how these windows can be harnessed so that space for proactive adaptation increases and maladaptive decisions are reduced.	climate change adaptation; maladaptation; decision-making; windows of opportunity; coastal planning	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762867	284413	2022.3916	Maintaining Carbon Storage Does Not Reduce Fish Production from Mangrove-Fish Pond System: A Case Study in Coastal Area of Subang District, West Java, Indonesia	Deforestation and degradation of mangrove forests can be categorized as key environmental problems in Indonesia. These problems are majorly driven by overexploitation and the conversion of mangroves into brackish water aquaculture areas. One of the most common aquaculture systems traditionally developed in the coastal areas is the mangrove-fish pond system that combines fish production with existing trees. This study aims to analyze the environmental and economic aspects of mangrove-fish pond aquaculture in different levels of mangrove cover in the coastal area of Subang District, West Java, Indonesia. The spatial analysis method was used to analyze mangrove distribution and identify the current coverage in the aquaculture area. The economic aspect was analyzed, based on the costs and revenue from fish production, while the environmental aspect was represented by carbon storage, which is among the crucial mangrove ecosystem services. This study estimated carbon storage in the four-carbon pools: above- and below-ground biomass, deadwood, and litterfall. Based on the combination of visual interpretation of Sentinel 2A satellite images and field observations, approximately 667 ha of mangrove-fish pond was identified. This study found that there were no significant differences in fish production and net income from mangrove-fish pond aquaculture at various levels of mangrove cover. Meanwhile, the ponds with high mangrove cover stored higher carbon than those with medium and low mangrove covers. This indicates that maintaining carbon storage does not reduce fish production from mangrove-fish pond aquaculture.

91762872	8693	2021.1152	An Analysis of Resilience Planning at the Nexus of Food, Energy, Water, and Transportation in Coastal US Cities	Climate change poses increased risks to coastal communities and the interconnected infrastructure they rely on, including food, energy, water, and transportation (FEWT) systems. Most coastal communities in the US are ill-prepared to address these risks, and resilience planning is inconsistently prioritized and not federally mandated. This study examined the resilience plans of 11 coastal US cities to understand 1. How FEWT systems were considered within resilience plans and, 2. How nexus principles or elements critical to a nexus approach were incorporated within resilience plans. A ``Nexus Index{''} was created to examine the incorporation of nexus principles, which included partnerships and collaborations, reference to other plans or reports, discussion of co-benefits, cascading impacts, and inclusion of interdisciplinary or cross-silo principles. These principles were used to score each action within the resilience plans. Results showed that only eight actions (1\% of all actions across the 11 plans) focused on the connections among FEWT systems within the resilience plans. The transportation system was associated with the most actions, followed by the energy system, water system, and the food system. While FEWT systems were not consistently included, there was evidence from the Nexus Index that the plans included elements critical to a nexus approach, such as the inclusion of partnerships and reference to co-benefits with the actions they designed to build resilience. The heterogeneity among the systems that each plan emphasized reflects the heterogeneity among the challenges that each city faces. While context-specific differences in resilience plans across cities are expected, some consistency in addressing certain infrastructural needs and their nexus interactions may greatly benefit and improve the implementation of resilience planning.	coastal resilience; resilience plans; food-energy-water-transportation nexus approach; urban resilience; nexus index	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762898	314959	2019.15821	Monopile-mounted wave energy converter for a hybrid wind-wave system	Multipurpose platforms are innovative solutions to combine the sustainable exploitation of multiple marine resources. Among them, hybrid wind-wave systems stand out due to the multiple synergies between these two forms of marine renewable energy. The objective of this work is to develop a hybrid system for monopile substructures, which are currently the prevailing type of substructure for offshore wind turbines, and more specifically to focus on the wave energy converter sub-system, which consists in an oscillating water column. For this purpose, an in-depth experimental campaign was carried out using a 1:40 scale model of the wave energy converter sub-system and the monopile substructure, considering regular and irregular waves. Based on the experimental results the performance of the device and its interaction with the wave field were characterised â€“ a fundamental step to fully understand the benefits and limitations of this hybrid wind-wave system, which sets the basis for its future development. Regarding the performance, the best efficiency was obtained with the turbine damping corresponding to a 0.5% orifice size, and two resonance peaks were identified (T = 9 and 6 s). As for the interaction of the hybrid system with the wave field, between 5% and 66% of the incident wave power is reflected and between 3% and 45%, transmitted. The wave period was found to be the parameter that most influenced wave run-up on the substructure. This characterisation of the behaviour of the hybrid system shows that it is indeed a promising option for further development.

To run life among these major threats, a good idea is to penetrate renewable energy sources gradually into the global energy market. These renewables are the best alternative to conventional fuels because of their abundant potential, non-pollutant nature and are exceedingly eco-friendly with the environment. The major renewables include wind, solar and diesel energy sources with a safety battery back-up to challenge the energy disaster to a possible extent. In addition, minor sources like fuel cells, biomass and tidal energy can also be included if the load demand is high. The careful blending of these available resources and technologies facilitate economic and environmental benefits.

The phenomenal increase in fossil fuel consumption over recent times has adversely affected our carbon footprint, severely impacting the environment. With strict environmental regulations in place, the focus towards renewable sources of energy is gaining momentum, supported by recent advancements in technologies in wind, hydro and solar. Wind energy was the first form of clean energy and has seen a major increase in power production. However, site restrictions limit the wind turbine from being used to its maximum potential. In recent years, the concept of some unconventional methods have been proposed. In this review, various types of wind turbines are discussed with their recent advances and depicting the challenges faced related to various aspects.

91762937	9935	2021.1353	Regional economic analysis of flood defence heights at the German Baltic Sea coast: A multi-method cost-benefit approach for flood prevention	Mean and extreme sea-level uncertainties, as well as uncertainty about future flood exposure, hinder the risk-based optimisation of flood protection investments. To deal with these uncertainties, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and methods for robust decision-making can be combined. This paper sequentially applies CBA, robust optimisation methods and info-gap analysis to find efficient and robust coastal flood protection strategies for the German Baltic Sea coast. The CBA results suggest that - under flood risk assumptions - a share of the coast of Schleswig-Holstein (9.3-10.1\%; 60-65 km) and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4.1-10.0\%; 78-189 km) with relatively high flood exposure, might currently be under-protected from a social welfare perspective. Present Value estimates of regional investment costs of five regret or loss minimising strategies range from 1.7 to 4.8 billion Euro across robustness metrics at 3\% discounting. The info-gap analysis suggests that some of these strategies will fail to prevent large-scale damages under high-end scenarios. We conclude that a multi-method cost-benefit approach can be used to narrow down the number of solutions that are both potentially efficient and sufficiently robust by investigating strategy performance within, across and beyond predefined scenarios.	climate change adaptation; cost-benefit analysis; flood protection; robust decision-making; info-gap; regret	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

In response, farmers take various adaptation measures to minimise the negative economic impact of these extreme events. The present study analyses the current adaptation strategies of the farm households and the inputs from the analysis can potentially help the future policies aimed at scaling up adaptation strategies to be more effective. A survey of 285 farm households was conducted in three cyclone- and flood-prone districts of Odisha. The study identifies various farm-level adaptation measures and their determinants. The determinants were agricultural extension, access to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, received crop loss compensation and access to informal credit. It is concluded that the adaptation policy and investment decisions should take into account these determinants in order to enhance the adaptive capacity of the rural farmers in the cyclone- and flood-prone regions of the state.

The East Side Coastal Resiliency (ESCR) project is the first phase of this huge project, showing how flood protection infrastructure could have more social effects. This radical urban transformation not only responds to the specific needs of communities today, but also remains flexible enough to develop over time, as urban conditions continue to change. ESCR gets designers, communities, and city agencies united, and creates a diversified city coastal landscape with a toolbox of materials and details that are typical of the city's past.

91762956	7821	2015.521	Conserving intertidal habitats: What is the potential of ecological engineering to mitigate impacts of coastal structures?	Globally, coastlines are under pressure as coastal human population growth and urbanization continues, while climatic change leads to stormier seas and rising tides. These trends create a strong and sustained demand for land reclamation and infrastructure protection in coastal areas, requiring engineered coastal defence structures such as sea walls. Here, we review the nature of ecological impacts of coastal structures on intertidal ecosystems, seek to understand the extent to which ecological engineering can mitigate these impacts, and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation as a tool to contribute to conservation of intertidal habitats. By so doing, we identify critical knowledge gaps to inform future research. Coastal structures alter important physical, chemical and biological processes of intertidal habitats, and strongly impact community structure, inter-habitat linkages and ecosystem services while also driving habitat loss. Such impacts occur diffusely across localised sites but scale to significant regional and global levels. Recent advances in ecological engineering have focused on developing habitat complexity on coastal structures to increase biodiversity. `Soft' engineering options maximise habitat complexity through inclusion of natural materials, species and processes, while simultaneously delivering engineering objectives such as coastal protection. Soft options additionally sustain multiple services, providing greater economic benefits for society, and resilience to climatic change. Currently however, a lack of inclusion and economic undervaluation of intertidal ecosystem services may undermine best practice in coastline management. Importantly, reviewed evidence shows mitigation and even restoration do not support intertidal communities or processes equivalent to pre-disturbance conditions. Crucially, an absence of comprehensive empirical baseline biodiversity data, or data comprising additional ecological parameters such as ecosystem functions and services, prohibits quantification of absolute and relative magnitudes of ecological impacts due to coastal structures or effectiveness of mitigation interventions. This knowledge deficit restricts evaluation of the potential of ecological engineering to contribute to conservation policies for intertidal habitats.

Deforestation due to rural-urban transitions may lead to a reduction in carbon storage ability. Coastal mangrove forests are particularly at risk from deforestation due to their location in the rapidly urbanizing coastal zone, and the city state of Singapore is an extreme example, losing as much as 90 \% of its original mangrove cover due to land reclamation and reservoir construction. Knowledge of mangrove ecosystem services may allow better conservation, restoration and incorporation of remaining mangrove patches into the urban landscape. Focusing on the regulating ecosystem service of carbon storage, mangrove carbon stocks have been estimated for Singapore using a combination of field and remote sensing techniques. Biomass carbon showed substantial spatial variation, with old, contiguous mangrove patches containing a higher density of biomass carbon than fragmented, river-fringing or restored mangroves. In total, national biomass carbon equated to 116,117.1 megagrams of carbon (Mg C), and a coarse estimate of the total carbon stock (including soil carbon) suggests that Singapore's mangroves may store 450,571.7 Mg C. While lower than other regional estimates focused on natural, oceanic mangroves, this is a significant carbon stock for a disturbed, urban mangrove system, and may be equivalent to the average annual carbon emissions of 621,000 residents. This analysis, alongside a review of other urban forest studies, highlights the importance of forested ecosystems such as mangroves in providing a carbon storage ecosystem service to urban areas.	above-ground biomass; blue carbon; carbon emissions; remote sensing; soil carbon	2016	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762968	6268	2008.181	Conservation action in a changing climate	Climate change will pose new challenges to conserving Earth's natural ecosystems, due to incremental changes in temperature and weather patterns, and to increased frequency and intensity of extreme climate events. Addressing these challenges will require pragmatic conservation actions informed by site-specific understanding of susceptibility to climate change and capacity of societies to cope with and adapt to change. Depending on a location's environmental susceptibility and social adaptive capacity, appropriate conservation actions will require some combination of: (1) large-scale protection of ecosystems; (2) actively transforming and adapting social-ecological systems; (3) building the capacity of communities to cope with change; and (4) government assistance focused on de-coupling communities from dependence on natural resources. We apply a novel analytical framework to examine conservation actions in five western Indian Ocean countries, where climate-mediated disturbance has impacted coral reefs and where adaptive capacity differs markedly. We find that current conservation strategies do not reflect adaptive capacity and are, therefore, ill prepared for climate change. We provide a vision for conservation policies that considers social adaptive capacity that copes with complexities of climate change better than the singular emphasis on government control and the creation of no-take areas.	adaptive capacity; social-ecological systems; socioeconomic; marine conservation; climate change; environmental susceptibility; coral bleaching; global change	2008	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1

However, forest remnants, littoral rainforests, and riparian vegetation have been shown to be particularly susceptible to cyclonic winds and post-disturbance weed invasion with consequences for their long-term conservation values. I evaluate the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones impacting the Wet Tropics region since records began in 1858. The recent Category 4 cyclones featured in this study, Larry and Yasi, had return intervals of about one in 70 years. I then discuss the natural resource management (NRM) lessons from Cyclone Larry and put forward practical recommendations on how authorities should deal with natural resources in the clean-up and recovery phases. I argue that natural resources must be treated as valuable commodities by including their protection and rehabilitation in the same way that human livelihoods, infrastructure and industry are covered in disaster management planning. This requires NRM issues to be included in disaster response policy and legislation, together with ensuring that structures are in place to mitigate the effects of cyclones on natural resources. There is a general consensus that tropical cyclone intensity will increase under climate change while frequency will decrease slightly. This has profound implications for the long-term sustainability of ecosystems in the Wet Tropics. There is a real risk of a phase shift to vegetation types dominated by disturbance species, including weeds, at the expense of cyclone intolerant species. It is therefore important that we begin to build more cyclone resilient landscapes to reduce the vulnerability of our remaining rainforest habitats and primary production systems. Securing landscape resilience requires greater NRM investment in key areas, including landscape connectivity, river repair, protecting coastal assets and cyclone resilient farms. While climate change poses a long-term threat to the rainforests of the region, we need to focus on more immediate pressures affecting our remaining biodiversity, notably clearing of native habitat, habitat fragmentation and degradation, and biosecurity issues.	tropical cyclones; ecological effects; resilience; natural resources; biodiversity conservation; contested landscapes; climate change; rainforest	2012	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91762976	234	2017.10	Household-Level Coastal Adaptation and Its Drivers: A Systematic Case Study Review	Evidence-based information on household-level adaptation is an important element of integrated management of vulnerable coastal regions. A growing number of empirical studies deal with household-level adaptation at the coast in different regions. This article provides a systematic review of these studies. We analyze studies according to how households in different parts of the world are currently adapting, or how they are intending to adapt, and identify explanatory factors for adaptation behavior and intention. We find that households implement a broad range of adaptation measures and that adaptation behavior is explained by individual factors such as socioeconomic and cognitive variables, experience, and perceived responsibilities. Nonpersonal characteristics have also been used to explain adaptation behavior and intention but have not been extensively investigated. Few studies employ qualitative research methods and use inductive approaches as well as models stemming from behavioral economics. Our findings suggest that coastal risk management policies should communicate the efficacy of household-level adaptation, in addition to information about flood risk, in order to encourage coastal households in their adaptation activities. In this context, we discuss the role of resources and responsibility of households for their adaptation behavior. We describe the lessons learnt and formulate a research agenda on household-level adaptation to coastal flood risk. In practice, coastal risk management policies should further promote individually driven adaptation by integrating it in adaptation strategies and processes.	accommodation; climate change; coastal flooding; coasts; household-level adaptation	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91762988	227478	2022.18976	Wind Turbine Technology Trends	The rise in prices of traditional energy sources, the high dependence of many countries on their import, and the associated need for security of supply have led to large investments in new capacity of wind power plants. Although wind power generation is a mature technology and levelized cost of electricity low, there is still room for its improvement. A review of available literature has indicated that wind turbine development in the coming decade will be based on upscaling wind turbines and minor design improvements. These include further improvements in rotor blade aerodynamics, active control of the rotor blade rotation system, and aerodynamic brakes that will lead to increased power generation efficiency. Improvements in system maintenance and early diagnosis of transmission and power-related faults and blade surface damage will reduce wind turbine downtime and increase system reliability and availability. The manufacture of wind turbines with larger dimensions presents problems of transportation and assembly, which are being addressed by manufacturing the blades from segments. Numerical analysis is increasingly being used both in wind turbine efficiency analysis and in stress and vibration analysis. Direct drive is becoming more competitive with traditional power transmission through a gearbox. The trend in offshore wind farms is to increase the size of wind turbines and to place them farther from the coast and in deeper water, which requires new forms of floating foundations. Due to the different work requirements and more difficult conditions of the marine environment, optimization methods for the construction of offshore substructures are currently being developed. There are plans to use 66-kV cables for power transmission from offshore wind farms instead of the current 33-kV cables. Offshore wind farms can play an important role in the transition to a hydrogen economy. In this context, significant capacity is planned for the production of ``green{''} hydrogen by electrolysis from water. First-generation wind turbines are nearing the end of their service life, so strategies are being developed to repower them, extend their life or dismantle and recycle them.	wind turbine; development trend; electricity; renewable energy sources	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91763003	7445	2021.965	Fishing Industry Perspectives on Sea-Level Rise Risk and Adaptation	Sea-level rise, already occurring over Florida's coast, stands to generate a significant impact on the state's fishing industry and coastal communities, exposing vulnerable areas and populations to extreme events and disrupting established patterns of fishery and marine resource use. Using a semi-structured interview approach, this study evaluated fishing industry perspectives on sea-level rise risk and adaptation in three Florida coastal communities. The results showed that adaptation responses vary across industry sectors and communities and are strongly influenced by experience, community dynamics, and age. Generally, older fishers are less willing to relocate due to social factors, such as strong place attachment, compared to younger fishers, who are more likely to retreat and/or work from a less vulnerable location. These findings suggest that adaptation responses, while influenced by experience, are mediated by age, attachment to place, and worldviews, and that these factors need to be accounted for when crafting adaptation strategies across coastal communities.	coastal management; adaptation; sea-level rise; climate change migration	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1
91763012	9314	2018.952	Ecotourism, climate change and reef fish consumption in Palau: Benefits, trade-offs and adaptation strategies	Marine ecosystems play a central role in economic and social life in the Republic of Palau, a Small Island Developing State in the Western Pacific. Marine resources underpin subsistence and commercial fisheries, as well as tourism activities, contributing substantially to Palau's GDP and employment. Since 1992, Palau has been actively developing conservation initiatives to protect marine resources, promote ecotourism, and ensure revenue generation. Marine reserves represent a particularly important tool in the country's sustainable development strategy. In 2015, Palau designated 80\% of its marine EEZ as a National Marine Sanctuary, with the remaining 20\% slated for domestic fisheries. That same year, Palau received 160 thousand tourists, over 9 times the country's population. In early 2017, the President proposed a bill effectively limiting budget travel and actively promoting high-end tourism. This study uses a quantitative social-ecological model to explore policy scenarios involving tourism, marine conservation and local food security. While climate change had the largest expected impact on local ecosystems, reef fish consumption contributes considerably to future projected declines in marine resources. Therefore, for Palau to achieve its goals of boosting revenues while sustainably stewarding marine resources, it will be necessary to transfer some level of consumption from reef fish on to tuna and other pelagics. Such changes, which align with the current proposal of developing an offshore national fishery as part of the Sanctuary's management plan, may allow Palau to meet future seafood demand, while protecting reef systems and the industries that rely on them.	sustainable fisheries; diving; subsistence; marine protected area; bio-economic; climate change adaptation; small-scale fisheries; integrated management	2018	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
91763014	5131	2021.684	Ecological consequences of sea level rise and flood protection strategies in shallow coastal systems: A quick-scan barcoding approach	Shallow coastal ecosystems have high ecological value and contribute to flood protection. Their stability is, however, sensitive to the amount and rate of future sea level rise (SLR), their ability to trap sediment which allows them to grow with rising sea level, and human response to SLR. So far, studies have focused on assessing SLR impacts using resource-intensive tools. Here, we present an approach for a first-order assessment and easily accessible `barcode' visualization to rapidly assess potential impacts of both SLR and adaptation strategies on coastal ecosystems in a spatially explicit way. Our approach relates habitat types (ecotopes) to water level, morphology and salinity, allowing users to determine shifts in spatial arrangements of ecological zones under different SLR rates and strategies. We illustrate this approach for a transect in the Dutch Wadden Sea. We find that beyond a critical rate of SLR, major changes in ecotope distribution are projected to occur as this part of the Wadden Sea starts to drown due to insufficient sediment import. Even larger impacts arise from adaptation strategies. Closing the barrier islands will turn the Wadden Sea into a freshwater lake-system with the absence of intertidal areas, infilling of channels and bank erosion. A strategy that allows for inland migration of the shoreline, results in a deep tidal basin with large subtidal habitats, and a shifted intertidal zone. Our case study shows that the barcoding approach provides a rapid, quantitative and spatially explicit overview of the potential implications for coastal ecosystems under different SLR scenarios, adaptation strategies and time horizons. This can then be used to screen adaptation strategies before going into a more comprehensive analysis. The barcode visualization allows for easy dissemination of potential ecological impacts to a broad community.	sea level rise; coastal ecosystems; adaptation; ecology; dutch wadden sea	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91763025	13850	2012.578	A Climate Change Adaptation Planning Process for Low-Lying, Communities Vulnerable to Sea Level Rise	While the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, provides guidelines for flood risk management, it is local governments' responsibility to delineate their own flood vulnerability, assess their risk, and integrate these with planning policies to implement adaptive action. However, barriers such as the lack of locally specific data and public perceptions about adaptation options mean that local governments must address the need for adaptation planning within a context of scientific uncertainty, while building public support for difficult choices on flood-related climate policy and action. This research demonstrates a process to model, visualize and evaluate potential flood impacts and adaptation options for the community of Delta, in Metro Vancouver, across economic, social and environmental perspectives. Visualizations in 2D and 3D, based on hydrological modeling of breach events for existing dike infrastructure, future sea level rise and storm surges, are generated collaboratively, together with future adaptation scenarios assessed against quantitative and qualitative indicators. This `visioning package' is being used with staff and a citizens' Working Group to assess the performance, policy implications and social acceptability of the adaptation strategies. Recommendations based on the experience of the initiative are provided that can facilitate sustainable future adaptation actions and decision-making in Delta and other jurisdictions.	adaptation; climate change; vulnerability; flooding; inundation; planning process; participatory planning; resilience; sea level rise; visualization; integrated assessment	2012	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91763028	155350	2015.5534	Integrating regional conservation priorities for multiple objectives into national policy	Multinational conservation initiatives that prioritize investment across a region invariably navigate trade-offs among multiple objectives. It seems logical to focus where several objectives can be achieved efficiently, but such multi-objective hotspots may be ecologically inappropriate, or politically inequitable. Here we devise a framework to facilitate a regionally cohesive set of marine-protected areas driven by national preferences and supported by quantitative conservation prioritization analyses, and illustrate it using the Coral Triangle Initiative. We identify areas important for achieving six objectives to address ecosystem representation, threatened fauna, connectivity and climate change. We expose trade-offs between areas that contribute substantially to several objectives and those meeting one or two objectives extremely well. Hence there are two strategies to guide countries choosing to implement regional goals nationally: multi-objective hotspots and complementary sets of single-objective priorities. This novel framework is applicable to any multilateral or global initiative seeking to apply quantitative information in decision making.

91763043	61158	2013.2853	Potential of sub-seafloor CO2 geological storage in northern South China Sea and its importance for CCS development in South China	The South China, especially Guangdong Province, as the most developed area of China emitted large CO2 from energy consumption and industrial production, actively advocates low-carbon development strategies. As an effective option to reduce CO2 emissions, CCS is potentially an effective option to reduce CO2 emissions to low-carbon economy development of South China, especially to Guangdong province. The CO2 storage potential in sedimentary basins onshore South China is limited as previous indicated. So the potential of sub-seafloor CO2 storage in offshore basins would be important. According to the assessment in this paper, large sedimentary basins offshore in the northern SCS have huge CO2 storage potential. Miocene deltaic, coastal plain, and neritic clastic rocks in these basins contain high-porosity and high-permeability aquifers and excellent seals. The estimated effective storage capacity, which is 2.6\% of the theoretical capacity, is similar to 300 GtCO(2) in PRMB, similar to 57 GtCO(2) in BBGB, similar to 41Gt CO2 in QDNB and similar to 160Gt CO2 in YGHB. On the whole, the Tertiary sedimentary basins in northern SCS margin have large storage capacities of abut 567Gt CO2, which provide a promising storage option for CCS implementation in South China. As the high costs is a major obstacles for sub-seafloor CO2 storage, the reuse of infrastructures for oil and gas development, such as platforms, wells and pipelines, would be the first choice. Although the theoretical storage capacities of the offshore oil and gas fields in the northern SCS are small, they distributed as groups and clusters and associated with sufficient quantified CO2 storage capacity in the saline aquifers. Further assessments are needed to define the residual life (= equipment life minus the field life) of the infrastructures, their practical and matched storage capacities, as well as a proper character and site screening particularly in regard to containment and risk of leakage. All these have been done well ahead of the real abandons of the oil/gas fields, so that the fields are in ``CO2 Storage Readiness (CSR){''}. (c) 2013 The Authors.

91763068	235326	2016.10218	Adaptive Planning for Transportation Corridors Threatened by Sea Level Rise	This paper describes a generalizable planning and assessment process for transportation planning adaptive to sea level rise (SLR). State Route 37 (SR-37) is the California highway most vulnerable to temporary flooding and permanent inundation as a result of SLR. Like many other coastal highways in the United States, SR-37 is adjacent to protected coastal systems (e.g., beaches, tidal wetlands), meaning that any activity on the highway is subject to regulatory oversight. Both SR-37 and the surrounding marshes are vulnerable to the effects of SLR. Because of a combination of congestion and threats from SLR, planning for a new highway adaptive and resilient to SLR impacts was conducted in the context of stakeholder participation and Eco-Logical, a planning process developed by FHWA to better integrate transportation and environmental planning. To understand which stretches of SR-37 might be most vulnerable to SLR and to what degree, a model of potential inundation was developed with a recent, high-resolution elevation assessment conducted using lidar. This model projects potential inundation by comparing future daily and extreme tide levels with surrounding ground elevations. The vulnerability of each segment was scored according to its exposure to SLR effects, sensitivity to SLR, and adaptive capacity (ability of other roadways to absorb traffic). The risk to each segment from SLR was determined by estimating and aggregating impacts to costs of improvement, recovery time (from impacts), public safety impacts, economic impacts, impacts on transit routes, proximity to communities of concern, and impacts on recreational activities.

91763071	194868	2022.16568	From plate to plug: The impact of offshore renewables on European fisheries and the role of marine spatial planning	Offshore renewables (OR), such as offshore wind farms, are a key pillar to address increasing energy demands and the global transition to a carbon-free power sector. The transition to ever more occupied marine spaces, often facilitated by marine spatial planning (MSP), increases the conflict potential with free ranging marine sectors such as fisheries. Here, we quantified for the first time the direct impact of current and future OR development on fisheries across European seas. We defined direct impact as the average annual fishing effort (h) overlapping with OR planning sites and applied an ensemble approach by deploying and harmonising various fisheries data to optimise spatial coverage for the European seas. The North Sea region will remain the centre of OR development for a long time, but a substantial increase of conflict potential between these sectors will also occur in other European sea basins after 2025. Across all sea basins, fishing fleets deploying bottom contacting gears targeting flatfish and crustaceans are and will be affected the most by the already constructed and planned OR. Our results provide a solid basis towards an understanding of the socio-economic effects of OR development on European fisheries. We argue that European MSP processes need to adopt common strategies to produce standardised and harmonised socio-economic data to understand implications of OR on free-ranging marine activities such as fisheries.	adaptive capacity; fishing effort displacement; fishing metiers; spatial overlap; offshore renewables; offshore wind farms	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
91763074	249538	2018.11913	Precautionary Management and the Development of Future Fishing Opportunities: The International Regulation of New and Exploratory Fisheries	The extensive pressures upon current commercial fisheries, compounded by the projected impacts of climate change and associated processes on marine ecosystems, will increasingly displace elements of future fishing effort towards new locations, target species and techniques. For transboundary stocks, where a new or exploratory fishery is contemplated, Article 6(6) of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement 1995 mandates cautious conservation measures to acquire sufficient catch data to assess the impacts of fishing on the stock and surrounding ecosystem. Thereafter, if appropriate, measures may be adopted to facilitate the gradual development of the fishery and its eventual transition to commercial management. However, there has been minimal analysis of the regulatory requirements for emergent fisheries during this interim stage. This article accordingly collates and evaluates the current international law and practice towards new and exploratory fisheries, with particular reference to Antarctic developments and the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems from proliferating deep-sea fisheries.	new fisheries; exploratory fisheries; precautionary approach; un fish stocks agreement 1995; commission for the conservation of antarctic marine living resources (ccamlr); vulnerable marine ecosystems	2018	Devi	??	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91763093	627	2022.87	Community perceptions of climate change and ecosystem-based adaptation in the mangrove ecosystem of the Rufiji Delta, Tanzania	Mangroves are increasingly recognized for their role in supporting adaptation to climate change and variability. However, knowledge about how climate change and variability affect mangrove ecosystem services (MES) and their role in supporting coastal communities to adaption is limited in Tanzania. We used participatory rural appraisal methods and field observations to explore local communities' perceptions of climate change and variability, and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) strategies in the mangroves of the Rufiji Delta, Tanzania. Decrease in rainfall, increased temperatures, coastal flooding, and the incidence of sea level rise were identified as key variables associated with a changing climate in the delta. Perceived climatic stresses included damaged fish breeding sites, altered climate regulation and a decrease in coastal protection and flood control. Decline in crop, fish and honey production were perceived as the main impacts on community livelihoods, although there were significant differences across occupational groups. Dependence on MES in times of shocks, such as when agriculture production fails, switching of occupation, crop diversification, fishing in deep waters and migration to other areas provided potential adaptation options. Although the reported perceptions related to climate change or variability are not explicit, they both have negative consequences to mangrove dependent communities' livelihoods.	climate change; mangroves; ecosystem services; ecosystem-based adaptation; rufiji delta; tanzania	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763094	233145	2022.9269	Power, knowledge and the transformative potential of marine community science	Community science has gained momentum as a participatory knowledge production approach that can transform governance into more transparent, socially relevant, and democratic endeavours. In the marine context, where the rationalisation of economic knowledge and the marginalisation of local communities are growing concerns, community science is advanced as a potential solution to environmental governance challenges. By increasing monitoring efforts and empowering members of the public to take political action to protect the oceans, community science has helped to transform marine management to address issues, such as, sea-level rise, overfishing, and ocean acidification. However, many community science projects do not realise their transformative potential and, instead, contribute toward reinforcing the status quo of governance, meaning that management challenges remain unsolved. To understand how the full potential of community science can be achieved, research must reframe what transformation is and assess why projects often fail to instigate change. Within community science research, there is an under-appreciation of how transformational change must involve actions that challenge prevailing power relations. We seek to address this gap by initiating a discussion on the political and power dimensions of community science. Drawing on the broader field of co-production, we argue that community science has been depoliticised to reinforce, as opposed to alleviate, unequal arrangements of power that inhibit societal transformation. To combat this, we suggest that community science must develop a more explicit comprehension of power and how it relates to the use and production of knowledge. Informed by the Foucauldian concept of power/knowledge, we argue for a politicised paradigm of community science that recognises how transformation requires pluralism, the contestation of knowledge, and learning amongst all community science actors. This review concludes by considering how transformative community science could introduce new ways of knowing to marine governance and facilitate more active community participation.

91763341	227068	2020.17640	Turbulent kinetic energy over large offshore wind farms observed and simulated by the mesoscale model WRF (3.8.1)	Wind farms affect local weather and microclimates; hence, parameterizations of their effects have been developed for numerical weather prediction models. While most wind farm parameterizations (WFPs) include drag effects of wind farms, models differ on whether or not an additional turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) source should be included in these parameterizations to simulate the impact of wind farms on the boundary layer. Therefore, we use aircraft measurements above large offshore wind farms in stable conditions to evaluate WFP choices. Of the three case studies we examine, we find the simulated ambient background flow to agree with observations of temperature stratification and winds. This agreement allows us to explore the sensitivity of simulated wind farm effects with respect to modeling choices such as whether or not to include a TKE source, horizontal resolution, vertical resolution and advection of TKE. For a stably stratified marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL), a TKE source and a horizontal resolution on the order of 5 km or finer are necessary to represent the impact of offshore wind farms on the MABL. Additionally, TKE advection results in excessively reduced TKE over the wind farms, which in turn causes an underestimation of the wind speed deficit above the wind farm. Furthermore, using fine vertical resolution increases the agreement of the simulated wind speed with satellite observations of surface wind speed.

91763348	242331	2022.15310	Falling ``fortresses{''}: Unlocking Governance Entanglements and Shifting Knowledge Paradigms to Counter Climate Change Threats in Biodiversity Conservation	Biodiversity conservation is facing unprecedented challenges at the intersection of rapidly changing climates, widespread ecosystem degradation under the influence of global warming and resultant human tragedies over livelihood, habitation, adaptation and coping needs. These challenges are more acute across biodiversity hotspots in the Global South. This study disentangles the complex interplay to propose alternative paradigms of governance and policy thinking necessary for sustainable biodiversity conservation. Climate change impacts are exposing critical deficiencies of `scientific forest management' pursued for over a century. For example, recurrent disasters and ecological shifts are increasingly obfuscating cognitive and physical boundaries between the reserve forest and human habitations; putting additional stress on livelihoods which in turn escalate pressures on the forest commons and fuel further conflicts between conservation governance and local communities. Instead of assisting in adaptation, the existing conservation governance mechanisms are producing further conflicts between humans and non-humans; livelihoods and conservation; disaster management and development. Conducted in the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve -world's largest mangrove forest ecosystem and a climate change hotspot located along the Bay of Bengal across India and Bangladesh -the study finds an urgent need of rethinking and recalibrating biodiversity conservation in the times of climate change. However, institutional and market-based approaches such as promoting ecotourism or mangrove plantations may have little impact in this regard, the study finds. Instead, integrating cultural ecosystem services and co-producing knowledge will be critical to tackle the entanglements of climate change and its impacts on local lives, livelihoods and biodiversity conservation.	biodiversity conservation; climate change; sundarbans; knowledge co-production; cultural ecosystem services; boundaries	2022	Yunne	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763362	19770	2021.2391	Segmented Swing-Structured Fur-Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Harvesting Blue Energy toward Marine Environmental Applications	Reducing carbon emissions to realize carbon neutrality is crucial to the environmental protection, and developing clean and renewable energy sources is an effective means to achieve this goal. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) provide a promising energy technology for converting the abundant renewable ocean wave energy on the earth surface. In this work, a segmented swing-structured fur-based TENG (SSF-TENG) is designed and fabricated to harvest low frequency water wave energy. The introduction of soft and dense rabbit furs reduces the frictional resistance and material wear, and the design and optimization of segmented structures further enhance the output performance of TENG. The use of ultra-lubricated bearings makes the SSF-TENG achieve an extended period of energy harvesting of more than 5 min after one triggering, with a total energy conversion efficiency of up to 23.6\%. Under the real water wave triggering, the SSF-TENG can deliver a maximum peak power of 6.2 mW and an average power of 0.74 mW. Furthermore, through effective water wave energy harvesting by the SSF-TENG or array, self-powered marine environmental applications are successfully demonstrated, which establishes a solid foundation for large-scale blue energy harvesting and realization of smart oceans.	blue energy; smart ocean; triboelectric nanogenerators; water wave energy harvesting	2021	Yunne	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91763370	240449	2006.2277	Adaptation to five metres of sea level rise	There is an unknown but probably small probability that the West-Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) will collapse because of anthropogenic climate change. A WAIS collapse could cause a 5-6 metre global sea level rise within centuries. In three case studies, we investigate the response of society to the most extreme yet not implausible scenario, a five-metre sea level rise within a century, starting in 2030. The case studies combine a series of interviews with experts and stakeholders with a gaming workshop. In the Rhone delta, the most likely option would be retreat, with economic losses, perhaps social losses, and maybe ecological gains. In the Thames estuary, the probable outcome is less clear, but would probably be a mix of protection, accommodation and retreat, with parts of the city centre turned into a Venice of London. A massive downstream barrier is an alternative response. In the Rhine delta (the Netherlands), the initial response would be protection, followed by retreat from the economically less important parts of the country and, probably, from Amsterdam Rotterdam metropolitan region as well. These impacts are large compared to other climate change impacts, but probably small compared to the impacts of the same scenario in other parts of the world. This suggests that the possibility of a anthropogenic-climate-change-induced WAIS collapse would strengthen the case for greenhouse gas emission reduction.

91763373	234639	2016.7142	High-resolution genetic linkage mapping, high-temperature tolerance and growth-related quantitative trait locus (QTL) identification in Marsupenaeus japonicus	The Kuruma prawn, Marsupenaeus japonicus, is one of the most promising marine invertebrates in the industry in Asia, Europe and Australia. However, the increasing global temperatures result in considerable economic losses in M. japonicus farming. In the present study, to select genetically improved animals for the sustainable development of the Kuruma prawn industry, a high-resolution genetic linkage map and quantitative trait locus (QTL) identification were performed using the RAD technology. The maternal map contained 5849 SNP markers and spanned 3127.23 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.535 cM. Instead, the paternal map contained 3927 SNP markers and spanned 3326.19 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.847 cM. The consensus map contained 9289 SNP markers and spanned 3610.90 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.388 cM and coverage of 99.06 \% of the genome. The markers were grouped into 41 linkage groups in the maps. Significantly, negative correlation was detected between high-temperature tolerance (UTT) and body weight (BW). The QTL mapping revealed 129 significant QTL loci for UTT and four significant QTL loci for BW at the genome-wide significance threshold. Among these QTLs, 129 overlapped with linked SNPs, and the remaining four were located in regions between contiguous SNPs. They explained the total phenotypic variance ranging from 8.9 to 12.4 \%. Because of a significantly negative correlation between growth and high-temperature tolerance, we demonstrate that this high-resolution linkage map and QTLs would be useful for further marker-assisted selection in the genetic improvement of M. japonicus.	marsupenaeus japonicus; high-resolution linkage mapping; snp makers; qtl mapping; rad; high temperature resistance; body weight	2016	Yunne	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91763383	195502	2020.15315	A New Energy Recovery Device by Utilizing the Merchant Ship Rolling	Wave energy is a renewable clean and resources for ships. According to the rolling characteristics of merchant ships, this research designs an energy recovery device installed on the ship deck to harvest the energy generated by waves. And a typical 50,000-ton ship is selected as the experimental platform of the device. The mathematical model is established and solved by Newmark-beta method, and a simulation platform is built in MATLAB. By simulating the movement of the slider in the device, it shows that the slider can realize reciprocating motion when the ship rolls continuously. Then, the relevant parameters in different combinations of natural frequency !n and damping ratio epsilon are calculated, the power output of the device and the motion law of the slider are analyzed, and parameters' variable curves are drawn in figures. Areasonable combination of omega(n) = 1.225 Hz, epsilon = 0.0612 and a relatively ideal average power (174.11 W) are found by comparing amounts of simulated results from typical sea conditions. It is indicated that four main factors affecting the power generation of the device include the elasticity coefficient K, effective damping coefficient C in the device, the ship rolling period and rolling angle. Besides, the device can still output power continuously by simulation in complex sea condition. Based on the research, it is proved that the device mentioned in this study has good feasibility in generating electric energy during ship rolling, which can provide valuable ideas for the application of wave energy in ships on voyage.	energy recovery device; newmark-beta method; ship; the rolling motion of ship; wave energy	2020	Yunne	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

We find that flooding led to reductions in employment (of about 4\%) and average wages (of about 2\%) among the affected businesses. The effects were substantially larger and more persistent in some parts of the city (Brooklyn and Queens) than others (Manhattan). Heterogeneity across boroughs reflects differences in the severity of flooding, building types and industry composition. The effects of flooding also vary by industry and businesses in sectors involved in rebuilding after the storm experienced employment growth. Flooding also led to establishment closings and relocation to other neighborhoods, which is a form of adaptation to increased flood risk.	climate change; sea-level rise; adaptation; hurricanes	2021	Yunne	Devi	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91763398	227979	2022.19012	Advanced energy flexibility enhancement via the novel resources of wave energy converter reservoirs and electric storages for a hybrid wave-wind energy supported hotel energy system	Renewable resources are fluctuating and uncontrollable. The susceptible and intermittent gen-eration not only causes the mismatch between the demand and supply but also brings grid pressure. Therefore, several measures were conducted on a coastal building energy system to enhance energy flexibility. From the aspects of operational cost, net present value, peak-shaving, valley-filling, and on-site electrical energy matching/fraction, a series of non-renewable and hybrid wave-wind-based renewable energy cases were studied to investigate the impact of the flexibility enhancement measures. Based on a specific electricity pricing scheme considering the monthly maximum power and the on-peak/off-peak energy demand, first, utilised the battery as a flexibility source to adjust the grid's interactions. It showed superior peak shaving capability during the on-peak period reaching 100\%. Second, the battery control after the load which was partially covered by hybrid wind-wave energy reduced about 1\% of operational cost. Generally, the battery control helped in various aspects whereas diminished the net present value due to high investment. Third, using the inherently integrated reservoir of the overtopping wave energy converter, the flexibility of the seawater discharging control like a reservoir-type power plant was investigated. The novel reservoir control presented outstanding comprehensive performance and feasibility. It enhanced the energy matching by 10\% and reduced the operational cost to 83.99\% compared with the case without employing control, bringing an extra 40\% increment of relative net present value.	flexibility control; wave energy converter; hybrid renewable; peak shaving; generation -side flexibility	2022	Yunne	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91763399	327632	2017.13271	Benchmarking sensor fusion capabilities of an integrated instrumentation package	Quantifying and mitigating environmental risks presented by marine energy conversion systems requires a variety of sensors (active acoustic, passive acoustic, and optical). The operation of these sensors must satisfy three directives to be effective: (1) do not alter the environment through operation of sensors; (2) capture rare events; and (3) do not accrue unmanageable volumes of low-value data. This requires integrating sensors into a single package, rather than operating them independently. The Adaptable Monitoring Package is an integrated instrumentation package that combines a multibeam sonar, acoustic camera, current profiler, optical cameras, and an array of hydrophones. The capabilities and limitations of the AMP sensors were benchmarked using cooperative targets, and real-time target tracking and detection was used to detect opportunistic targets (e.g., diving birds, seals). During an initial deployment, automatic detection of opportunistic targets achieved a 58% true positive rate and a 99% true negative rate (100% corresponding to an ideal system in both cases). In post-processing, target tracking data were used to evaluate automatic target classification capabilities using a k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Results suggest that real-time target classification should be possible and enable integrated instrumentation systems to meet the monitoring needs of marine energy deployments.

However, the influence of plant invasion on soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools sizes, stability, and turnover in SOM of invaded ecosystems is not fully understood. In this study, soil C and N contents, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of free light fraction (LF), intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iP0M) and mineral-associated organic matter (mSOM) were investigated in an invasive Spartina alterniflora community, adjacent bare flat and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities. Short-term S. alterniflora invasion significantly enhanced organic C and N contents in SOM, free LF, iPOM, mSOM compared with bare flat and increased the proportion of allocated C in iPOM compared with S. salsa and P. australis soils (0-0.30m depth). The proportion of the S. alterniflora-derived C in free LF and iPOM were significantly higher than that in mSOM, and the highest S. alterniflora-derived C content was found in iPOM of S. alterniflora soil. The most enriched delta N-15 values were found in S. alterniflora soil. Increased 815N values and decreased C:N ratios from the free LF to iPOM to mSOM in S. alterniflora soil indicated a greater degree of decomposition. The results suggest that 10-year S. alterniflora invasion significantly alters soil organic C and N pools sizes and stability through changing plant residuals input, physical distribution of S. alterniflora-derived C and C turnover in SOM fractions.

First, a horizontally periodic precursor simulation is performed to create turbulent flow data. Then those data are used as inflow into a tidal turbine array two rows deep and infinitely wide. The turbines are modelled using rotating actuator lines, and the finite-volume method is used to solve the governing equations. In studying the wakes created by the turbines, we observed that the vertical shear of the inflow combined with wake rotation causes lateral wake asymmetry. Also, various turbine configurations are simulated, and the total power production relative to isolated turbines is examined. We found that staggering consecutive rows of turbines in the simulated configurations allows the greatest efficiency using the least downstream row spacing. Counter-rotating consecutive downstream turbines in a non-staggered array shows a small benefit. This work has identified areas for improvement. For example, using a larger precursor domain would better capture elongated turbulent structures, and including salinity and temperature equations would account for density stratification and its effect on turbulence. Additionally, the wall shear stress modelling could be improved, and more array configurations could be examined. Â© 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The improvement of fishing technology has been detrimental to the sustainability of fisheries, which is particularly clear for the bottom trawl fishery. Reducing its environmental impact is a key point for the development of a more sustainable fishery. The present work analyzed different possibilities to mitigate the impact of gears on the seabed and to increase the efficiency of the bottom trawl fishery of the Western Mediterranean. The analysis of three experiments showed that innovative technical and regulation measures can lead to benefits such as the reduction of fishing effort, the improvement of the cost-benefit relation and the reduction of the direct impact on the seabed and the indirect effect on the ecosystems through reduce discards and the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. After years of studies focused on improving the sustainability of this fishery, it's about time to turn this improvement into reality.	fishing impact; fuel consumption; efficiency; gears design; bottom trawl; western mediterranean	2017	Yunne	NA	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
91763420	14125	2013.712	Conceptual Design of CO2 Transportation System for CCS	Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emission is strongly requested in relation to the global warming issue. The development of innovative technology including Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) is required to achieve the CO2 reduction targets. Because of the geological structure of the domestic complex in Japan, reservoirs near sources of emissions have not enough storage capacity of CO2. Therefore, transportation to suitable sites will be necessary for large amount of CO2 storage. Three methods of transporting CO2 from coal-fired power plant to offshore storage sites near Japan's coastline were studied. One with transporting liquefied CO2 by ship, another with transporting CO2 hydrate by ship, and the third by a pipeline. Transportation distance is approximately 700-1,000km for the former two cases, and 120km for pipeline. The case study on a demonstration scale and a commercial use was executed. The CO2 transport volume set for each case is 240,000 ton-CO2/year and 1,540,000 ton-CO2/year respectively. This research was executed as a contract study from New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

91763441	233683	2017.8770	The role of breakwaters on the rehabilitation of coastal and mangrove forests in West Kalimantan, Indonesia	The breakwaters, which were built by the government of West Kalimantan, Indonesia in late 1993 were aimed to protect the coast and mangrove forest. However, the effectiveness of building the breakwaters is not known because no measurement has been done. This study aimed to reveal the effectiveness of building breakwaters to protect the coast and its role in the rehabilitation of mangrove forest. The role of breakwaters in protecting the coast and rehabilitating the mangrove forest were assessed by comparing differences between the condition when there were no breakwaters versus condition after the breakwaters built. Beside building breakwaters, the government plant Rhizopora to restore the mangrove forest. The success rate of mangrove rehabilitation effort was determined by measuring density and distribution of Rhizophora and colonization of Avicennia marina. The study conducted using survey method with a landscape approach conducted in three bays of the South China Sea, West Kalimantan, Indonesia, which are: Penibung, Sungai Duri, and Karimunting. The measurement of parameters was conducted with purposive sampling technique based on perpendicular toward the sea area. The parameters measured were shoreline differences, the distribution of bottom and drift sediment, and the prediction of longshore sediment transport alongside the shore. The result showed that the breakwaters built in Karimunting and Penibung Bay were successful to reduce the amount of coastal erosion up to 70\% within 22 years. On the contrary, the breakwaters built in the Bay of Sungai Duri could not reduce the coastal erosion. The effects of breakwaters on mangrove rehabilitation were clear, which can be observed on the colonization rate of Avicennia marina and reforestation of Rhizophora sp. in Karimunting Bay. The abrasion of shoreline still occurred although there were breakwaters built. It might be caused by the construction of breakwaters were segmented. The condition worsens by activities of beach sand excavation. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study assesses the capability of such an OWF to provide communication-less frequency support (CLFS) to an onshore ac network. It is shown that the HVdc link's offshore terminal direct voltage can be estimated from measurements at the OWF's point of connection with the DR platform. Two different methods are proposed for implementing CLFS in the OWF active power controls. In Method 1, the estimated offshore terminal direct voltage is used for estimating the onshore frequency deviation. In Method 2, the actual offshore terminal direct voltage measurement is used instead. Unique features of the provision of CLFS from OWFs connected to HVdc via DRs are highlighted, and the dynamic and static performance of the CLFS control scheme is compared to that of the communication-based frequency support scheme. To assess the impact of parameter estimation errors on the provision of CLFS, a parametric sensitivity study is presented as well, and recommendations are given to increase accuracy.

91763450	242775	2023.983	Identifying gaps in early warning mechanisms and evacuation procedures for tsunamis in Sri Lanka, with a special focus on the use of social media	Purpose The current National Early Warning System for Sri Lanka (NEWS: SL) was established after the devastations of the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004. Although early warning (EW) systems and evacuation procedures are in place, several areas which need improvements have been emphasized in recent studies carried out in the country. Therefore, this paper aims to outline the gaps in existing EW and EP related to tsunami and other coastal hazards with a special focus on the use of social media for disaster communication based on age groups. Design/methodology/approach This study has drawn on a review of past studies carried out by the same research team to identify the scope of the study. In addition to that, a conceptual framework was developed for the use of social media in the event of a disaster. Based on this conceptual framework, an online questionnaire was administered to identify the current status of the use of social media in Sri Lanka during a disaster situation. In total, 408 responses were collected and analyzed using the binary logistic regression method to evaluate the variation of different predictors associated with the use of social media for disaster communication. Findings Findings of the study revealed that the use of social media for disaster communication depends on the previous experience of users and their age. The gender of users does not affect the use of social media for disaster communication. Therefore, the accuracy and timeliness of disaster information distributed via social media should be improved further to enhance the use of social media for disaster communication. Moreover, the findings have highlighted unaddressed issues in areas such as governance; communication of technical agencies; evacuation and shelters; and response of the community. Originality/value This paper has identified key areas that need attention in the process of enhancing the use of social media for disaster communication. More use of technological platforms such as social media for receiving disaster-related information can address issues such as bottlenecks in communication, poor awareness and lack of last-mile dissemination. Furthermore, this paper has proposed recommendations for addressing the identified gaps in the overall EW mechanisms and EP pertaining to tsunamis and other coastal hazards to enhance the coastal disaster resilience in Sri Lanka.	governance; social media; tsunami; evacuation; coastal disasters; early warnings	2023	Yunne	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763461	391814	2017.5884	Assessing strategies for protecting transportation infrastructure from an uncertain climate future	This paper investigates the importance of explicitly considering the stochastic nature of future climate impact predictions and predictive accuracy for optimal investment planning in the protection of coastal and inland transportation infrastructure against climate impacts. Such impacts include sea level rise, coastal and riverine flooding resulting from more frequent and intense precipitation events, storms, storm surges and other extreme events. For this purpose, numerical experiments utilizing stochastic optimization based methodologies were conducted on a case study of the Washington, D.C. Greater Metropolitan area proximate to the Potomac River under varying climatic predictions. Results from the numerical experiments suggest a 54% reduction in added costs due to the implementation of chosen protective infrastructure investments. They also indicate a reduction in added costs (capital investment and added delays) on the order of 19% when the investments are chosen to hedge against probable future flooding events as compared with planning for the 50th percentile SLR prediction with associated weather events. A potential gain of nearly 27% in reduced costs through improved predictive accuracy in climatic forecasts is also noted, suggesting significant value in more accurate forecasts.

91763472	343147	2014.10216	An overview of the state of the art technologies for multi-MW scale offshore wind turbines and beyond	An overview of technological trends in the design of multi-mega Watt wind turbines focused on the offshore sector is presented. The state of the art technologies for wind turbine design are multidisciplinary ranging from blade aeroelasticity, power transmission to the generator, to advanced control systems that ensure performance and the design of offshore support structures to minimize cost of energy. Light weight carbon fiber blades, aeroelastic tailoring using bend-twist coupling are discussed in coordination with a multitude of aerodynamic technologies for optimal power capture such as high-lift airfoils, flaps, and flat-back airfoil designs. The pitch control of the turbine responsible for rotating the blades about its axis to reduce loads is the primary load reducing mechanism of the wind turbine, for which technologies that enable wind sensing such as forward looking LIDARs and redundancy mechanisms such as individual blade pitch control offer promising advances. The lack of reliability of the gearbox has resulted in drive train technologies to move toward direct drives, whose benefits and liabilities are assessed in combination with generator concepts. The support structures are discussed within an offshore framework for shallow, moderately deep, and deep waters. Fixed substructures such as monopiles, tripods, jackets, as well as floaters such as spar buoys and tension leg platforms are brought forth. The advances in these different component technologies that enable the wind turbine system to be reliable and cost effective are described as a precursor to further in-depth reviews.

91763484	240721	2005.3148	Group report: Global change and the European coast - climate change and economic development	The effects of climate change on economic development in the coastal zone cannot be ignored in future coastal zone management plans. This chapter reports the outcome of the group discussion centred round the three questions posed by Nicholls and Klein on how the coastal zone can be effectively managed in the future. The first question asked how we can marry together the human and natural values of a system in the upcoming decades. The results of the discussion highlighted the utility of using scenarios to obtain good management plans that take into account the three provisions of human safety, economic develepment and ecological integrity while still achieving a situation of sustainable development. The second question addressed the tools required to achieve these management goals and discusses the role of public participation and media communication. The third question asked what proactive strategies can be used to effectivoly manage the coastal zone in the 21(st) Century and an example of the Humber estuary management plan is given. It is proposed that a robust and flexible integrated coastal zone management plan is the only effective way to manage the coastal zone in a sustainable manner in the uncertain face of climate change.

91763487	3307	2022.504	Multicriteria Decision Analysis to Assist in the Selection of Coastal Defence Measures: Involving Coastal Managers and Professionals in the Identification and Weighting of Criteria	Coastal socio-ecological systems are complex adaptive systems with nonlinear changing properties and multi-scale dynamics. They are influenced by unpredictable coastal hazards accentuated by the effects of climate change, and they can quickly be altered if critical thresholds are crossed. Additional pressures come from coastal activities and development, both of which attracting stakeholders with different perspectives and interests. While coastal defence measures (CDMs) have been implemented to mitigate coastal hazards for centuries, a lack of knowledge and tools available to make informed decision has led to coastal managers favouring the choice of seawalls or rock armours with little consideration for socio-ecological systems features, and stakeholders' priorities. Though it is not currently widely applied in coastal zone management, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a tool that can be useful to facilitate decision making. PROMETHEE, an outranking method, was chosen to support the multicriteria decision analysis for the evaluation of CDMs in the context of four study sites characterized by distinct environmental features. The aim was to determine the relevance and benefits of a MCDA by integrating coastal zone stakeholders in a participatory decision-making process in order to select CDMs that are better adapted to the whole socio-ecological system. First, in a series of five workshops, stakeholders were asked to identify and weigh criteria that were relevant to their local conditions. Second and third, CDMs were evaluated in relation to each criterion within the local context, then, hierarchized. Initial results show that vegetation came first in three of the four sites, while rock armour ranked first in the fourth site. A post-evaluation of the participatory process indicated that the weighting phase is an effective way to integrate local knowledge into the decision-making process, but the identification of criteria could be streamlined by the presentation of a predefined list from which participants could make a selection. This would ensure criteria that are standardized, and in a format that is compatible with the MCDA. Coupled with a participatory process MCDA proved to be a flexible methodology that can synthetize multiple aspects of the problem, and contribute in a meaningful way to the coastal engineering and management decision-making process.	coastal engineering; coastal defence measure; decision-making; integrated coastal zone management (iczm); participatory process; coastal protection; multicriteria decision analysis (mcda); promethee	2022	Yunne	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763492	227860	2020.17700	Environmental Permitting and Compliance Cost Reduction Strategies for the MHK Industry: Lessons Learned from Other Industries	The marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) industry plays a vital role in the U.S. clean energy strategy by providing a renewable, domestic energy source that may offset the need for traditional energy sources. The first MHK deployments in the U.S. have incurred very high permitting costs and long timelines for deploying projects, which increases project risk and discourages investment. A key challenge to advancing an economically competitive U.S. MHK industry is reducing the time and cost required for environmental permitting and compliance with government regulations. Other industries such as offshore oil and gas, offshore wind energy, subsea power and data cables, onshore wind energy, and solar energy facilities have all developed more robust permitting and compliance pathways that provide lessons for the MHK industry in the U.S. and may help inform the global consenting process. Based on in-depth review and research into each of the other industries, we describe the environmental permitting pathways, the main environmental concerns and types of monitoring typically associated with them, and factors that appear to have eased environmental permitting and compliance issues.	marine and hydrokinetic energy; environmental permitting; environmental compliance; other industries	2020	Yunne	Devi	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

(How's the Weather?): Integrating Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit and Environmental Forecasting Products to Support Travel Safety around Pond Inlet, Nunavut, in a Changing Climate	As Inuit hunters living in Pond Inlet, Nunavut, we (N. Simonee and J. Alooloo) travel extensively on land, water, and sea ice. Climate change, including changing sea ice and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, hasmade it riskier and harder for us to travel and hunt safely. Inuit knowledge supporting safe travel is also changing and is shared less between generations. We increasingly use online weather, marine, and ice products to develop locally relevant forecasts. This helps us to make decisions according to wind, waves, precipitation, visibility, sea ice conditions, and floe edge location. We apply our forecasts and share them with fellow community members to support safe travel. In this paper, we share the approach that we developed from over a decade of systematically and critically assessing forecasting products such as Windy. com, weather and marine forecasts, tide tables, C-CORE's floe edge monitoring service, SmartICE, Zoom Earth, and time-lapse cameras. We describe the strengths and challenges we face when accessing, interpreting, and applying each product throughout different seasons. Our analysis highlights a disconnect between available products and local needs. This disconnect can be overcome by service providers adjusting services to include more seasonal and real-time information, nontechnical language, familiar units of measurement, data size proportional to internet access cost and speed, and clear relationships between weather, marine, and ice information and safe travel. Our findings have potential relevance in the circumpolar Arctic and beyond, wherever people combine Indigenous weather forecasting methods and online information for decision-making. We encourage service providers to improve product relevance and accessibility. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: As Inuit hunters in Pond Inlet, Nunavut, we combine our knowledge of environmental conditions with weather, marine, and ice forecasting products to travel safely. Products developed for urban environments or economic sectors are not directly relevant to our seasonal activities, so we have had to learn how to access and interpret them. Like other Indigenous peoples, we face challenges such as limited and expensive bandwidth, having to consult multiple sources, doing mathematical unit conversions, vague or unfamiliar terminology, and insufficient geographical coverage. We have worked hard to develop a clearer understanding of the relationships between information provided and our local travel conditions. Information services can help further by being more user-friendly, complete, and locally applicable to cultural and geographic context.	arctic; forecasting techniques; climate variability; adaptation; climate services; communications/decision making; decision support; indigenous knowledge; risk assessment; societal impacts	2021	Yunne	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763507	235327	2016.10221	Mangrove Management, Assessment, and Monitoring	This chapter provides an overview of mangrove management, assessment, and monitoring. It addresses the need for integrated planning and management, based on sound legal principles. The central part of the chapter covers mangrove conservation and planting. Conserving existing mangrove forest is often more effective than planting new forests. When a decision for planting has been made, one has to differentiate between planting on degraded and non-degraded sites and distinguish between replanting, rehabilitation, restoration, and afforestation. Emphasis is put on the need for careful selection of appropriate sites and species and on an ecosystem-based approach to mangrove planting and management which uses and supports natural regeneration and other natural processes. Since the primary intention with any rehabilitation intervention works is for improved protection of existing seedlings and forests from degradation or destruction, then planting should be undertaken only if absolutely necessary. Involving local communities in mangrove management is an effective way of maintaining and enhancing the protection function of the mangrove forest while providing livelihood for local people and contributing to better assessment and governance of natural resources. Assessment of the status of mangrove forests is essential for better conservation planning and management. This includes research and economic assessment and valuation. The last section highlights the importance of applied/participatory as well as academic and long-term monitoring (see also chapter ``.

91763509	54657	2020.5021	EFFECTIVENESS OF ECO-FRIENDLY DESIGN OPTIONS IN PACIFIC ISLAND NATIONS	Several countries suffer from rising sea levels which aggravate beach erosion and wave overtopping. Many Pacific island nations including Tuvalu are faced with the threat of disappearing as rising sea levels cause beach erosion. For this reason, countermeasure designs are needed to prevent this. It is difficult to build sturdy constructions on Pacific islands due to their locations far from developed countries which makes installation difficult. Moreover, Pacific island nations have low wave energies making soft techniques suitable as countermeasures. Eco-friendly designs that use the soft technique, and which also do not ruin the landscape, can be chosen as a design technique for these areas. Various economical and eco-friendly soft techniques using locally produced materials were applied in this study to protect against possible damage from erosion as well as overtopping. Hydraulic model tests were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these designs. In eco-friendly designs, locally produced sand and gravel nourishments and gravel bags using locally produced gravel were compared through hydraulic model tests. Gravel nourishments showed good results as a countermeasure when using the wave characteristics of Cyclone Ula, which has a 10-year return period; however, gravel dunes formed on the backshore which might spoil the aesthetics of the shore. The results of gravel bags along with sand nourishment showed a relatively good level of protection and additionally it can prevent gravel from moving around and spoiling the aesthetics of the shore.	gravel bag; gravel nourishment; pacific island; global warming; coastal erosion	2020	Yunne	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

The Bangladesh government, a few international organizations, and some non-government organizations are working on developing livelihood opportunities in there. But there is scarce study about the livelihood opportunities and challenges of the Rohingyas living there. This study explores the vulnerabilities and livelihood opportunities of Rohingyas in Bhashan Char so as to help increase their resilience. The vulnerabilities include natural, geographical, and climatic shocks and stresses (e.g., cyclone, floods, storm surge, sea-level rise, geographical position). However, there are ample opportunities for their livelihood development, despite some challenges which can be overcome with concerted efforts. The opportunities include intensification and extensification of livelihood activities, such as modern agriculture, fish farming, livestock rearing, small business, handicraft, fishing net mending, crab fattening, biofloc aquaculture, and fish cage culture, but turning these opportunities into reality requires sufficient investment and internationally positive attitude. Better shelter, better disaster preparedness, cultural practices, education, and skill development can increase their capacity to bounce back, absorb shocks, and make them more resilient. National and international humanitarian organizations should plan to enhance the resilience of the Rohingya communities living in Bhashan Char and the island itself so that they can sustain in the long run, even after their anticipated repatriation to Myanmar.	rohingya refugees; livelihood vulnerability; livelihood resilience; bhashan char; bangladesh; myanmar	2022	Yunne	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763575	235207	2016.9791	Community perspectives on an internationally funded mangrove restoration project: Kien Giang province, Vietnam	It is common for environmental restoration projects to be reviewed by the administering organizations but it is much less common for the communities that the projects are meant to serve to detail their experiences and perceptions of the outcomes. We evaluate an internationally funded mangrove restoration project and reflect upon the lessons learned in regard to the project strategies and interventions, particularly from the perspective of the local community. The Vam Ray coast, Kien Giang Province, Vietnam, was seriously eroded by 2008. In May 2009, a demonstration project was established which achieved a high survival rate of transplanted mangroves and sea mud accumulation. This study used participatory action research methods (literature review, semi-structured interviews, field visits, and peer debriefing) to evaluate the project outcomes. Despite the project being generally very successful, its implementation and results were inadequately documented by agencies involved due in large part to insufficient local involvement during the reporting process, even though the local community was fully involved in the project planning and implementation. Inadequate documentation has led to mistakes being made when attempts have been made to replicate the project elsewhere, and incomplete findings have been incorporated into mangrove management plans at the provincial and regional levels. Using the community knowledge from the time of the project implementation and since, we detail the successes and problems encountered to provide more complete reporting, to assist transferability of the methods to other eroding muddy coasts in Vietnam and potentially elsewhere.

91763588	8402	2013.436	Adaptive capacity and regional water governance in north-western Germany	Successful adaptation to climate change requires flexible adaptation strategies which consider regional ecological, economic and social circumstances. Coastal zones are considered to be significantly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The projected impacts of climate change in the metropolitan region of Bremen-Oldenburg, Germany (a coastal area), are, for example, rising sea level, salt water intrusion, temporary groundwater scarcity in the summer and increased (heavy) rainfalls. This paper uses an existing framework, the Adaptive Capacity Wheel (ACW), complemented by two additional dimensions: adaptation motivation and adaptation belief. The objectives were first, to assess the adaptive capacity of water governance in the study region, and second, to show how the ACW can be used as an approach and a communication tool with stakeholders to identify strengths and weaknesses. Based on this, a further objective was to discover what lessons and recommendations can be drawn that could help water experts and stakeholders in the future. The results show a high adaptive capacity and that the addition of the psychological dimensions was valuable. However, it is important to look closely at each dimension assessed by the ACW. The key recommendations are: to improve public participation; to ensure better coordination; to raise awareness; and to reduce the lack of political will to overcome adaptation barriers.	adaptive capacity; adaptive capacity wheel (acw); climate change adaptation; north-western germany; water governance	2013	Yunne	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91813140	247024	2019.12744	Climate resilience in marine protected areas and the `Protection Paradox'	Restricting human activities through Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is assumed to create more resilient biological communities with a greater capacity to resist and recover following climate events. Here we review the evidence linking protection from local pressures (e.g., fishing and habitat destruction) with increased resilience. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings, studies have only rarely attributed resilience responses to the recovery of food webs and habitats, and increases in the diversity of communities and populations. When detected, resistance to ocean warming and recovery after extreme events in MPAs have small effect sizes against a backdrop of natural variability. By contrast, large die-offs are well described from MPAs following climate stress events. This may be in part because protection from one set of pressures or drivers (such as fishing) can select for species that are highly sensitive to others (such as warming), creating a `Protection Paradox'. Given that climate change is overwhelming the resilience capacity of marine ecosystems, the only primary solution is to reduce carbon emissions. High quality monitoring data in both space and time can also identify emergent resilience signals that do exist, in combination with adequate reference data to quantify the initial system state. This knowledge will allow networks of diverse protected areas to incorporate spatial refugia against climate change, and identify resilient biological components of natural systems. Sufficient spatial replication further offers insurance against losses in any given MPA, and the possibility for many weak signals of resilience to accumulate.

91813141	262085	2016.3212	Swansea Bay tidal lagoon annual energy estimation	UK Energy policy is focused on the challenges posed by energy security and climate change, however, efforts to develop a low-carbon economy have overlooked tidal energy a vast and unexploited worldwide resource. Since 1981, UK tidal lagoon schemes have been recommended as an economically and environmentally attractive alternative to tidal barrages. More recently, two proposals for tidal lagoons in Swansea Bay have emerged and there have been several reports documenting the potential to harness significant tidal energy from Swansea Bay using a tidal lagoon. This paper assists in determining a realistic approximation of the energy generation potential in Swansea Bay, a numerical estimation is obtained from a zero dimension, 0D, 'backwards difference' computational model, utilising the latest turbine data available and high-resolution bathymetric data. This paper models the behaviour of the tidal lagoon in dual mode generation, in line with the above proposals. The results of model testing using a variety of fixed and variable parameters are displayed. The ebb mode model with provision for pumping at high tide is then explored further by carrying out optimisations of the starting head, number of turbines and turbine diameter in order to determine the maximum annual energy output from the tidal lagoon.

91813142	13662	2017.1104	Climate change damages to Alaska public infrastructure and the economics of proactive adaptation	Climate change in the circumpolar region is causing dramatic environmental change that is increasing the vulnerability of infrastructure. We quantified the economic impacts of climate change on Alaska public infrastructure under relatively high and low climate forcing scenarios {[}representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) and RCP4.5] using an infrastructure model modified to account for unique climate impacts at northern latitudes, including near-surface permafrost thaw. Additionally, we evaluated how proactive adaptation influenced economic impacts on select infrastructure types and developed first-order estimates of potential land losses associated with coastal erosion and lengthening of the coastal ice-free season for 12 communities. Cumulative estimated expenses from climate-related damage to infrastructure without adaptation measures (hereafter damages) from 2015 to 2099 totaled \$5.5 billion (2015 dollars, 3\% discount) for RCP8.5 and \$4.2 billion for RCP4.5, suggesting that reducing greenhouse gas emissions could lessen damages by \$1.3 billion this century. The distribution of damages varied across the state, with the largest damages projected for the interior and southcentral Alaska. The largest source of damages was road flooding caused by increased precipitation followed by damages to buildings associated with near-surface permafrost thaw. Smaller damages were observed for airports, railroads, and pipelines. Proactive adaptation reduced total projected cumulative expenditures to \$2.9 billion for RCP8.5 and \$2.3 billion for RCP4.5. For road flooding, adaptation provided an annual savings of 80-100\% across four study eras. For nearly all infrastructure types and time periods evaluated, damages and adaptation costs were larger for RCP8.5 than RCP4.5. Estimated coastal erosion losses were also larger for RCP8.5.	alaska; climate change; damages; adaptation; infrastructure	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91813143	258383	2017.4108	The potential to integrate blue carbon into MPA design and management	Oceans and coasts provide a wide array of services to humans, including climate regulation, food security, and livelihoods. Managing them well is vital to human well-being as well as the maintenance of marine biodiversity and ocean-dependent economies. Carbon sequestration and storage is increasingly recognized as a valuable service provided by coastal vegetation. Carbon sequestered and stored by mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows is known as â€˜blueâ€™ carbon. These habitats capture and store carbon within the plants themselves and in the sediment below them. When the habitats are destroyed, much of their carbon is released back to the atmosphere and ocean contributing to global climate change. Therefore, blue carbon ecosystem protection is becoming a greater priority in marine management and is an area of interest to scientists, policy makers, coastal communities, and the private sector including those that contribute to ecosystem degradation but also those that are looking to reduce their carbon footprint. A range of policy and management responses aim to reduce coastal ecosystem loss, including the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). This paper explores how MPA design, location, and management could be used to protect and increase carbon sequestration and ensure integrity of carbon storage through conservation and restoration activities. While additional research is necessary to validate the proposed recommendations, this paper describes much needed first steps and highlights the potential for blue carbon finance mechanisms to provide sustainable funding for MPAs.

91813144	30471	2018.2472	Reefcrete: Reducing the environmental footprint of concretes for eco-engineering marine structures	The ecological value of engineered marine structures can be enhanced by building-in additional habitat complexity. Pre-fabricated habitat units can be cheaply and easily cast from concrete into heterogeneous three-dimensional shapes and surface topographies, with proven ability to enhance biodiversity on artificial structures. The net ecological benefits of enhancement using concrete, however, may be compromised on account of its large environmental footprint and poor performance as substrate for many marine organisms. We carried out a pilot study to trial alternative cast-able ``Reefcrete{''} concrete mixes, with reduced environmental footprints, for use in the marine environment. We used partial replacement of Portland cement with recycled ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), and partial replacement of coarse aggregate with hemp fibres and recycled shell material. We calculated the estimated carbon footprint of each concrete blend and deployed replicate tiles in the intertidal environment for 12 months to assess their performance as substrate for marine biodiversity. The hemp and shell concrete blends had reduced carbon footprints compared to both ordinary Portland cement based concrete and the GGBS based control concrete used in this study. At the end of the experiment, the hemp and shell blends supported significantly more live cover than the standard GGBS control blend. Taxon richness, particularly of mobile fauna, was also higher on the hemp concrete than either the shell or GGBS control. Furthermore, the overall species pool recorded on the hemp concrete was much larger. Community compositions differed significantly on the hemp tiles, compared to GGBS controls. This was largely explained by higher abundances of several taxa, including canopy-forming algae, which may have facilitated other taxa. Our findings indicate that the alternative materials trialled in this study provided substrate of equal or better habitat suitability compared to ordinary GGBS based concrete. Given the growing interest in ecological engineering of marine infrastructure, we propose there would be great benefit in further development of these alternative ``Reefcrete{''} materials for wider application.

91813147	153076	2016.9646	Mangrove reforestation: greening or grabbing coastal zones and deltas? Case studies in Senegal	Besides their important contribution to global biodiversity, mangroves provide many services. Nevertheless, due to an increase of human activities and to climate change, in less than 20 years these ecosystems have lost one fifth of their global surface area. In response to this decrease, mangrove reforestation incentives have spread throughout the world. The scientific and societal legitimacy of reforestation actions still remain in question. Focusing on two case studies, the Saloum Delta and Lower Casamance, Senegal, our methodology was mainly based on the analysis of environmental narratives and discourses between 2009 and 2013, and on reforestation campaigns conducted by NGOs. We highlight the complexity of the system of values associated with the mangroves, as well as the positive and negative interactions between the services. Even although the reforestation campaigns were generally successful in terms of reforested surfaces and international visibility, they were poor in terms of biological and cultural diversities and led to spatial injustice. Moreover, the extensive reforestation with a unique mangrove species, Rhizophora mangle, was perceived as means of green grabbing', and the simultaneous buying of carbon tax by industrial conglomerates induced disempowerment of the local communities. More integrated research programmes must be developed towards the extensive knowledge of the mangroves.	carbon forestry; ecosystem services; global climate change policy; green grabbing; mangrove ecology; political ecology; reforestation	2016	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Hydrate formed instantly from the gas phase at 349 meters but then decomposed rapidly in ambient seawater. At 3627 meters, the seawater-carbon dioxide interface rose rapidly because of massive hydrate formation, forcing spillover of the liquid carbon dioxide from the container. A strong barrier between the liquid carbon dioxide and interaction with the sediments was observed. A pool of liquid carbon dioxide on the sea floor would expand in volume more than four times, forming hydrate; which will dissolve.	fossil fuel carbon dioxide;  ocean disposals, carbon dioxide;  gas hydrates;  interfaces (materials);  sediments, fossil fuels, carbon dioxide;  fossil fuel;  sea water, carbon dioxide;  fossil fuel;  gas hydrate;  ocean dumping, article;  environmental protection;  hydration;  priority journal;  sea;  sediment;  temperature;  waste disposal	1999	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

This study aims to determine the level of risk due to inundation hazards that occur in current conditions and projected conditions through risk assessment with spatial approaches and adaptation strategies needed, The vulnerability parameters that used are exposure (topography, land use, infrastructure), adaptation capacity (drainage), sensitivity (population density, education level, age, gender and poverty). In the baseline condition, Jakabaring and its surrounding areas is on moderate level of risk. Meanwhile in the projection condition (2030), Jakabaring and its surrounding areas is on high level of risk. The adaptation strategies due to climate change impact that can be carried out are river normalization, drainage normalization, infiltration measure, pumping, green open space, canalization, bio-pore, water retention ponds, multiplying gardens in residential area, roads enhancement, pavement enhancement, polders along rivers, and supervision of swamp regulations.

91759794	7462	NA.105	Impacts of sea level rise on wave overtopping rates around the coast of England	There is unequivocal evidence that global sea levels are rising. It is therefore inevitable there will be socioeconomic impacts as a result of this. To aid mitigation, and the implementation of adaptation measures, it is vital the magnitude of the potential impact is quantified. Current approaches in the UK make simplifying assumptions regarding the relationship between present-day and future economic damage relating to coastal flood risk. The analysis undertaken here supports studies of an improved impact of sea level rise by providing national-scale estimates of changes in wave overtopping rates and flood defence overflow rates, as a result of different amounts of sea level rise. The analysis involves the application of components of an existing risk-based coastal flood risk analysis method. A subset of almost 600 flood defence assets around the country has been analysed for sea level rise rates up to 1 m. The resulting analysis shows that, on average, the wave overtopping rate increases by up to 150 times above present-day rates for lower return periods and by up to five times for higher return periods. This differential arises as a result of non-linearities in overtopping rates with increasing extreme sea levels.	climate change; coastal engineering; embankments	NA	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91759796	11481	2020.1407	Beyond static spatial management: Scientific and legal considerations for dynamic management in the high seas	Natural and human stressors in the high seas act across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. These include direct interaction such as fisheries bycatch or indirect interaction like warming oceans and plastic ingestion. Area-based management tools (ABMTs), such as marine protected areas and time-area closures, are a widely accepted and a broadly successful form of management used to mitigate localized human impacts on marine species and ecosystems. Protection provides an opportunity for population recovery, which can then propagate outside of the closure. As the United Nations negotiates a new treaty on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction, efforts to design and implement high seas ABMTs at appropriate scales are critical to ensure that these spatial protection measures are most effective and climate-ready in the face of changing oceans. Here we identify the four most important temporal scales contemporary, intra-annual, multi-annual and multidecadal - for aligning high seas ABMTs to relevant ecological, oceanographic and atmospheric processes. From this, we explore how managers and decision-makers can integrate this knowledge when implementing a new treaty.

91759798	259082	2017.447	Long-term CO2 Emission Reduction from Renewable Energy in Power Sector: The case of Thailand in 2050	This paper presents CO2 mitigation potential in the power sector of Thailand regarding to the Power Development Plan (PDP 2015) and Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP 2015). Renewable energy and advanced technology have the potential to play an important role in providing clean energy. The Long-range Energy Alternative Planning (LEAP) model is used to analyze future electricity demand, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions reduction in the long term planning during 2010-2050. Regarding to those plans, implementations of renewable energy and advanced technology are proposed for mitigation options. The mitigation scenarios offer sustainable potential of renewable technologies and advanced technologies such as solar, wind, biomass, nuclear, hydropower, hydrogen fuel cell, tidal, geothermal and fossil-fuel power plants with carbon capture storage (CCS). Four mitigation scenarios are modeled along with the BAU scenario. The Mitigation 1 (MIT01) scenario is the base-case mitigation scenario based on the target of PDP2015, which target of renewable energy is 19,634 MW in 2036. In the Mitigation 2 (MIT02) scenario, the technologies in the MIT01 plus new technologies such as hydrogen fuel cell, tidal and geothermal are implemented. Clean fossil fuel technologies with CCS, for example natural gas and coal technologies, are applied in the Mitigation 3 (MIT03) scenario. In the Mitigation 4 (MIT04) scenario as the peak CO2 scenario. Results show that, in the BAU scenario, electricity demand and CO2 emissions from the power sector will increase to 52,770 ktoe and 345,959 kt-CO2eq, respectively in 2050. By adopting mitigation options, total CO2 emissions in 2050 can be mitigated by 69.66% in MIT04, following by 50.83% in MIT02, 47.22% in MIT03, and 41.71% in MIT01 when compared to the BAU scenario. Moreover, regarding to the MIT04, Thailand can meet its peak CO2 emission by 2036. Â© 2017 The Authors.

Primary household surveys (528 households in sevenmouzas) are carried out to procure data on indicators of socio-demographic profile, livelihood strategies, health, food, water, social networks, natural disaster and climatic fluctuations. The data then have been processed by indices like livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) and livelihood vulnerability index-intergovernmental panel on climate change (LVI-IPCC) to evaluate and compare vulnerabilities ofmouzascurrently suffering from physical processes like coastal erosion, embankment breaching and flood events. The research outcome implies that Baliara and Iswaripurmouzasare highly vulnerable (LVI score > 0.600 and LVI-IPCC score > 0.170); Narayanpur, Mousuni, Kusumtalamouzasare moderately vulnerable (LVI score 0.540-0.600 and LVI-IPCC score 0.060-0.170); and Bagdanga, Patibaniamouzasare least vulnerable (LVI score > 0.540 and LVI-IPCC score < 0.060) to changing climate phenomena. The foremost reasons behind higher vulnerability are greater exposure to climatic fluctuation, natural hazards and higher sensitivity to improper access to food, health, water and finally lower adaptive capacity in terms of poor socio-demographic profile and livelihood security. Findings of the study provide a deeper understanding of people's perception, adaptation and their ever-increasing vulnerability to changing climate. This approach based on indicators emphasizes sectors that necessitate particular intercession to design management plans for threatened communities. Such type of pragmatic approach of study formulates reliable methodology to quantify vulnerability and develop disaster management strategies to increase the resilience of vulnerable coastal people to climate change.	climate change; coastal erosion; embankment breaching; livelihood vulnerability indices; disaster management strategies	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91759815	7453	2011.326	Getting Ready for a Changing Climate: Supporting Councillor's Leadership Role in Adaptation	Adapting to climate change means adapting the way we do things - in all areas of our lives - to respond to the changing circumstances (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), What is adaptation? http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climate/adaptation/what.htm 2008). Adaptation is fundamentally a local issue - flooding, coastal erosion, agricultural patterns, employment, regeneration and land use all impact the local level. It is now recognised that local governments have an important role in grappling with the complex impacts of climate change and setting in motion plans for their services and communities. Councillors (elected members) play a key role in championing adaptation at the local level. Their ongoing enthusiasm in driving forward the green agenda, their awareness of the risks of business as usual and their passion for community wellbeing puts them in the best position to develop public awareness of, and the political will, for taking action on adaptation. This paper identifies councillors' leadership role in the adaptation agenda. It presents a checklist with five suggested actions for councillors. On communicating the adaptation agenda to the public, councillors could use more simple language, give practical examples and use more innovative channels of communications. On supporting their councils to take action, councillors could present a business case for adaptation and help build partnerships for delivery.	adaptation; councillors; leadership; communicate; improve	2011	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91759830	57875	2021.5686	Impacts of large-scale aquaculture activities on the seawater carbonate system and air-sea CO2 flux in a subtropical mariculture bay, southern China	In this study, the variations of the seawater carbonate system parameters and air-sea CO2 flux (F-CO2) of Shen'ao Bay, a typical subtropical aquaculture bay located in China, were investigated in spring 2016 (March to May). Parameters related to the seawater carbonate system and F-CO2 were measured monthly in 3 different aquaculture areas (fish, oyster and seaweed) and in a non-culture area near the bay mouth. The results showed that the seawater carbonate system was markedly influenced by the biological processes of the culture species. Total alkalinity was significantly lower in the oyster area compared with the fish and seaweed areas, mainly because of the calcification process of oysters. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) were highest in the fish area, followed by the oyster and non-culture areas, and lowest in the seaweed area. Oysters and fish can have indirect influences on DIC and pCO(2) by releasing nutrients, which facilitate the growth of seaweed and phytoplankton and therefore promote photosynthetic CO2 fixation. For these reasons, Shen'ao Bay acts as a potential CO2 sink in spring, with an average F-CO2 ranging from -1.2 to -4.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1). CO2 fixation in the seaweed area was the largest contributor to CO2 flux, accounting for ca. 58\% of the total CO2 sink capacity of the entire bay. These results suggest that the carbonate system and F-CO2 of Shen'ao Bay were significantly affected by large-scale mariculture activities. A higher CO2 sink capacity could be acquired by extending the culture area of seaweed.	carbonate chemistry; air-sea co2 flux; f-co2; seaweed culture; oyster culture; shen'ao bay	2021	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91759831	11606	2017.945	Prospect theory, mitigation and adaptation to climate change	Prospect theory (PT) is a widely accepted theory for decisions under uncertainty. However, so far a systematic application to climate policy (CP) does not exist. One important postulation of PT is that outcomes are perceived as gains or losses, relative to the reference point. When it comes to CP, different decision-makers may have different reference points. For example, one decision-maker perceives the current climate as the reference point whereas another decision-maker may have another one, say climate in 100years. For the former, climate damages are losses and the benefits of CP are reductions of losses. For the latter, benefits of CP are gains. PT suggests that the former places a higher value in CP than the latter. After a critical review whether and how PT may be applied to CP, the paper systematically presents this and other cases where PT offers new insights into climate-related analyses, notwithstanding the importance of well-known aspects such as discounting, altruism, political and economic costs. It is shown that accounting for PT may contribute to a better understanding of some well-known puzzles in the climate debate, including different preferences for CP amongst individuals and nations, the role of technical vs. financial adaptation, and the apparent preference for hard protection measures in coastal adaptation. Finally, concrete possibilities for empirical research on these effects are proposed.	climate change; prospect theory; reference dependence; adaptation; mitigation	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

The paper attempts to examine the issues of coastal poverty, food security as well as livelihood insecurity and the adaptation options that help to the resilience of climate change. The paper is based on field survey conducted in the villages of Sunderans in 2011. The study revealed that fishing and crab collection, honey collection are the important sources of livelihood. The fishing resources have been declining which leads to the insecurity of livelihoods of the fishing communities. The study has identified the key adaptations like dependency of money lenders, fishing and crab collection, formation of Self Help Groups, livestock rearing and migration. This paper has important policy implications for poverty, livelihood vulnerability and migration.

Adaptation strategies are unlikely to be effective without an understanding of the fishermen's perception on climate change. This paper explores fishermen's knowledge on climate change perceptions and their climate change adaptation in response to the perceived impacts of climate change. A survey by interviewing randomly selected 90 marine capture fishermen was conducted in Bengkulu from March to June 2018. The results indicate that most fishermen understand climate change as a change of east and west monsoon that directly affect their fishing activities. In terms of climate change defined as a continuous change of temperature, humidity, and rainfall, most fishermen have no sufficient knowledge on climate change. The important adaptation strategies include diversification of household economic activities, augmenting of fishing gear, change the fishing ground, mobilization of family members to work, and fishing time adjustment.

91759849	5654	2017.458	A globally deployable strategy for co-development of adaptation preferences to sea-level rise: the public participation case of Santos, Brazil	Sea-level rise (SLR) poses a range of threats to natural and built environments in coastal zones around the world. Assessment of the risks due to exposure and sensitivity of coastal communities to coastal flooding is essential for informed decision-making. Strategies for public understanding and awareness of the tangible effects of climate change are fundamental in developing policy options. A multidisciplinary, multinational team of natural and social scientists from the USA, the UK, and Brazil developed the METROPOLE Project to evaluate how local governments may decide between adaptation options associated with SLR projections. METROPOLE developed a participatory approach in which public actors engage fully in defining the research problem and evaluating outcomes. Using a case study of the city of Santos, in Brazil, METROPOLE developed a method for evaluating risks jointly with the community, comparing `no-action' to `adaptation' scenarios. At the core of the analysis are estimates of economic costs of the impact of floods on urban real estate under SLR projections through 2050 and 2100. Results helped identify broad preferences and orientations in adaptation planning, which the community, including the Santos municipal government, co-developed in a joint effort with natural and social scientists.	sea-level rise; adaptation preferences; climate change; participatory approach; santos; brazil; metropole project/belmont forum	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

To improve the use of Cymodocea nodosa seedlings, obtained from seeds germinated in vitro, in restoration programs, we investigated the ammonium and phosphate uptake rates of seedlings, and the synergistic effects of light levels (20 and 200 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) and different nitrogen to phosphorus molar ratios (40 mu M N:10 mu M P, 25 mu M N:25 mu M P, and 10 mu N:40 mu M P) on the photosynthetic activity and growth of seedlings. The nutrient content of seedlings was also compared to the seed nutrient reserves to assess the relative importance of external nutrient uptake for seedling development. Eighty two percent of the seeds germinated after 48 days at a mean rate of 1.5 seeds per day. All seedlings under all treatments survived and grew during the 4 weeks of the experiment. Seedlings of C. nodosa acquired ammonium and phosphate from the incubation media while still attached to the seed, at rates of about twice of adult plants. The relevance of external nutrient uptake was further highlighted by the observation that seedlings' tissues were richer in nitrogen and phosphorus than non-germinated seeds. The uptake of ammonium followed saturation kinetics with a half saturation constant of 32 mu M whereas the uptake of phosphate increased linearly with nutrient concentration within the range tested (5 - 100 mu M). Light was more important than the nutrient ratio of fertilization for the successful development of the young seedlings. The seedlings' photosynthetic and growth rates were about 20\% higher in the high light treatment, whereas different nitrogen to phosphorus ratios did not significantly affect growth. The photosynthetic responses of the seedlings to changes in the light level and their capacity to use external nutrient sources showed that seedlings of C. nodosa have the ability to rapidly acclimate to the surrounding light and nutrient environment while still attached to the seeds. C. nodosa seedlings experiencing fertilization under low light levels showed slightly enhanced growth if nourished with a balanced formulation, whereas a slight increase in growth was also observed with unbalanced formulations under a higher light level. Our results highlight the importance of high light availability at the seedling restoration sites.	cymodocea nodosa; germination; light; nutrient ratios; nutrient uptake; seeds; seedlings	2018	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91759867	6893	2019.727	Risk assessment for the sustainability of coastal communities: A preliminary study	With communities increasingly concentrated in coastal regions globally, governments and stakeholders call for cohesive risk assessments for future sustainability in the wake of natural hazards. This can only be achieved through risk-based decision-making and smart resources treatment. To provide a basis for such actions, we here propose a risk assessment (RA) framework focusing on the risk-resilience-sustainability nexus. In contrast to focusing on the traditional RA approach, we propose an integrative approach based on hazard, vulnerability, and resilience covering the full spectrum of RA for effective risk reduction. We further explain how the proposed framework can simultaneously provide useful input for resilience management in parallel to achieving certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We apply this framework for typhoon risk assessment (represented by a Typhoon Risk Index-TRI) of coastal counties of mainland China. Different TRIs e.g. total population, elderly population, non-adult population, and economic status are calculated for each coastal county to supplement multi-objective empirical measures for risk reduction. The RA results show a large spatial heterogeneity in typhoon risk with an increase in the risk from north to south along the coast of mainland China. The comparative results from this study are relevant to the prioritization of different regions for immediate or gradual actions, wise decision-making, and risk reduction through proper treatment of resources-related policy implications. The evaluation of the SDGs achievement status reveals that the overall performance of coastal provinces in mainland China is higher to achieve SDGs 3 and 15 followed by 13 and 8. The study shows that while Guangdong province is in the highest risk category, its achievement status for SDG-13 (climate actions, strengthening resilience) is the lowest relative to other provinces, which is critical. This study represents a major scientific contribution to mainland China's coastal risk management and calls for aligning risk-informed planning and sustainability frameworks. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

91759871	235299	2016.10117	Preface: Monitoring and modelling to guide coastal adaptation to extreme storm events in a changing climate	Storms across the globe and their associated consequences in coastal zones (flooding and erosion), combined with the long-term geomorphic evolution of our coastlines, are a threat to life and assets, both socioeconomic and environmental. In a changing climate, with a rising global sea level, potentially changing patterns in storm tracks and storminess, and rising population density and pressures on the coastal zone, the future risk of coastal storm impacts is likely to increase. Coastal managers and policy makers therefore need to make effective and timely decisions on the use of resources for the immediate and longer term. Research focused on ``monitoring and modelling to guide coastal adaptation to extreme storm events in a changing climate{''} is becoming more common; its goal is to provide science-based decision support for effective adaptation to the consequences of storm impacts, both now and under future climate scenarios at the coast. The growing transfer of information between the science community and end-users is enabling leading research to have a greater impact on the socioeconomic resilience of coastal communities. This special issue covers recent research activities relating to coastal hazard mapping in response to extreme events, economic impacts of long-term change, coastal processes influencing management decisions and the development of online decision support tools.

Climate change is likely to have a substantial impact on fish production that can lead to a fragile food security condition in the country. This paper assesses the potential economic impact of three important climate change adaptation strategies - natural resource management (NRM), fish aggregating devices (FAD) and aquaculture - in Solomon Islands. The study used a country-specific partial equilibrium economic model with six fish sub-sectors and analyzed potential impact of alternate climate change adaptation strategies for 2035 and 2050. The modeling and scenario analyses show that total fish demand is likely to surpass domestic fish production in 2050. Without appropriate climate adaptation strategy, per capita consumption of domestically produced fish will decline, which has serious negative food security implications for the country. The economic (welfare) analysis conducted based on modeling results show that the national level net economic gains due to climate change adaptation strategies are substantial. If cost and topographic conditions permit, low-cost inshore FADs are expected to be a good mechanism for augmenting domestic supplies of tuna and similar species in Solomon Islands.

91759883	220545	2020.17156	Design of self-righting steam generators for solar-driven interfacial evaporation and self-powered water wave detection	Solar-driven interfacial evaporation has attracted growing attention as an emerging and sustainable technology for wastewater purification and desalination. Tremendous research efforts have been dedicated to developing interfacial steam generators that can operate under realistic weather conditions such as changing solar intensity, water salinity, air flow and humidity, yet the effects of water waves have been largely neglected. Herein, we develop the first ever tumbler-shaped steam generator to improve the floating stability of interfacial steam generators. Apart from the good water evaporation rate of similar to 1.3 kg m(-2) h(-1) under one sun in both freshwater and seawater, the tumbler-shaped monolithic steam generator demonstrates outstanding wave-piercing, anti-overturning and self-righting behavior with good structural durability in typical waves of open water. Gratifyingly, further integration of the tumbler-shaped steam generator with a triboelectric nanogenerator enables detection of several water wave parameters (frequency, height, velocity and wavelength) in real-time with high sensitivity. This work provides design protocols not only for developing stable interfacial steam generators for solar-driven water purification and desalination, but also for scaling-up clean water production in open water and engineering self-powered water wave detection, forecast, and blue energy harvest systems.

This vulnerability is expressed in several ways, from exposure to sea level rises, to salt intrusion, and extensive droughts in some areas. Despite this rather negative trend, there are examples of initiatives where the vulnerability of SIDS can be reduced, and their resilience may be increased. Based on the paucity of the literature on concrete examples of successful climate change adaptation initiatives on SIDS, this paper presents an overview of pertinent challenges faced, and introduces two case studies from the Solomon Islands, which illustrate how much can be achieved by systematically pursuing adaptation strategies. The lessons learned from these case studies are outlined and some useful insights are provided, which may help SIDS to better foster the development opportunities with climate change adaptation offers to them.	climate change; adaptation; solomon islands; development; migration	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

The Greenheart Project vessel design was developed by an open-source design process and is part of an initiative to develop zero-emission sail and solar ships for remote island locations. The original vessel design stands unaltered since 2014 and the design has now been tested against an updated set of client requirements which were developed in cooperation with local stakeholders. Proposed adaptations to the design are described and an alternative design is proposed that specifically matches with the proposed client requirements. Three types of requirements are developed and discussed: technical, operational, and economic. The research results in adaptations which are integrated into a final design.

The community and regional planning field is awakening to the importance of culture as a concern in planning, including community well being, distinctiveness, cohesion, and capacity. Since planning is often conducted with a spatial focus, the concept of cultural landscapes is a potentially useful tool, and in particular for climate change and sea level rise adaptation. This article describes an action research project for local sea level rise adaptation planning that attended to cultural landscapes. The planning process asked: (1) What core cultural landscapes are important to maintain? (2) What cultural landscapes may be lost due to external changes and adaptation choices? and (3) What cultural landscape adaptive capacities exist to achieve community resilience? The project communities are the towns of Yankeetown and Inglis, neighboring small towns situated in the rural Gulf coast of Florida. The project found that locally significant cultural landscapes emerge when residents participate in planning processes, and that these landscapes hold new keys to successful adaptation.

The survey is based on the opinion of a group of 20 experts representing different fields of earth and technical sciences. They represent Norway and Poland, where the location of such a system is considered. Based on expertsâ€™ experience and opinions, all factors that seem to be significant were classified into the following groups: targets, key factors, results, determiners, motor and brakes, regulating factors, external factors, auxiliary factors, and autonomous factors. Direct influences between variables were indicated. Due to major differences in geological conditions in Poland and Norway, the factor of on-or offshore technology was pointed out as the primary determiner. Among key factors, the system operationâ€™s long-term safety and level of technological readiness were indicated. As a target factor, an interest of local authority was pointed out. Among the variables that are important when selecting locations for this type of system, nine are essential: (1) Formal constraints related to local nature protection areasâ€”this variable is essential in the case of an onshore system; (2) Availability of CO2 sources; (3) Level of geological recognition; (4) The distance of the CO2-EGS from a thermal energy user and electricity grid; (5) Existing wells and other infrastructure; (6) Depth of the EGS system; (7) Water depth if offshore, this variable is only important when offshore systems are involved; (8) Physical parameters of reservoir rocks; (9) Reservoir temperature.

Since 2009 technology banding has been added, meaning that different technologies are rewarded with a different number of certificates. We analyze these two different renewable obligation policies in a mathematical representation of an electricity market with random availabilities of renewable generation outputs and random electricity demand. We also present another, alternative, banding policy. We provide revenue adequate pricing schemes for the three obligation policies. We carry out a simulation study via sampling. A key finding is that the UK banding policy cannot guarantee that the original obligation target is met, hence potentially resulting in more pollution. Our alternative provides a way to make sure that the target is met while supporting less established technologies, but it comes with a significantly higher consumer price. Furthermore, as an undesirable side effect, we observe that a cost reduction in a technology with a high banding (namely offshore wind) leads to more CO2 emissions under the UK banding policy and to higher consumer prices under the alternative banding policy.

91759904	13308	1996.206	Learning from integrated assessment of climate change	The objective of integrated assessment of climate change is to put available knowledge together in order to evaluate what has been learned, policy implications, and research needs. This paper summarizes insights gained from five years of integrated assessment activity at Carnegie Mellon. After an introduction, in Section 2 we ask: who are the climate decision makers? We conclude that they are a diffuse and often divergent group spread all over the world whose decisions are primarily driven by local non-climate considerations. Insights are illustrated with results from the ICAM-2 model. In Section 3 we ask: what is the climate problem? In addition to the conventional answer, we note that in a democracy the problem is whatever voters and their elected representatives think it is. Results from studies of public understanding are reported. Several other specific issues that define the problem, including the treatment of aerosols and alternative indices for comparing greenhouse gases, are discussed. In Section 4 we discuss studies of climate impacts, focusing on coastal zones, the terrestrial biosphere and human health. Particular attention is placed on the roles of adaptation, value change, and technological innovation. In Section 5 selected policy issues are discussed. We conclude by noting that equity has received too little attention in past work. We argue that many conventional tools for policy analysis are not adequate to deal with climate problems. Values that change, and mixed levels of uncertainty, pose particularly important challenges for the future.

91760220	518	2016.43	Adaptation Through Climate Smart Agriculture: Status and Determinants in Coastal Bangladesh	The adoption of climate smart agriculture as an adaptation strategy is overwhelmingly stressed in recent times. The Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan 2009 has envisaged adaptation through adoption of climate smart agriculture. Although the literature on agricultural adaptation in general has noticeably increased in recent times, little is known about the adoption of climate smart agriculture as a strategy of adaptation against climate change and extreme events. This study is intended to achieve two objectives. First, to assess the status of the adoption of climate smart agriculture as an adaptation strategy and second to examine the factors that influence the adoption of climate smart agriculture in environmentally stressed areas of coastal Bangladesh. The empirical part of this study was conducted in Dacope Upazila (sub-district) of south-west coastal Bangladesh. Two hundred and thirty five randomly selected households were interviewed through a semi-structured questionnaire during March-June in 2011. From a literature review, 25 indicators which capture three dimensions of climate smart agriculture, such as sustainability of production, resilience to change and the potential for mitigation of emissions were used in the questionnaire. Responses against each of these were rated in a 5-point Likert scale. Information about various socio-demographic, economic, ecological, and adaptive behavioural characteristics of households and their farms were collected as well. By employing the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) technique, weak adopters and strong adopters of the three dimensions of climate smart agriculture are identified. Finally, by employing the Multivariate Probit model, the influence of various factors on the adoption of climate smart agriculture are assessed. The adoption of sustainable production is mostly related to the frequent exposure to rainfall (irrigation facility), sharecropping, and the age of the household head. The adoption of adaptive measures for resilient agriculture are related to frequent exposures to dry spells, the size of farm landholding and frequent exposures to saline water. On the other hand the adoption of measures for the reduction of emissions are related to land degradation by salt, membership of a social group, and the education of the head of household. Other factors have very limited influence in this regard. Finally this study came up with some policy suggestions, the implementation of which would help the coastal inhabitants to better adopt climate smart agriculture as an adaptation strategy to ensure livelihood and food security against climate change and extreme events.	adaptation; climate smart agriculture; coastal livelihood; food security; bangladesh	2016	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760221	47988	2017.3236	Learnings from the Shell Peterhead CCS Project Front End Engineering Design	Commercial-scale demonstration of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is required to advance wide-spread implementation of CCS technology across a range of carbon-intensive industries, in order to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to atmosphere. Capturing the learnings from leading demonstration projects is key for design optimisation, technology development and in turn, cost reduction. The importance of knowledge sharing and dissemination of learnings is of particular importance for CCS in order to maximise the cost-competitiveness of the technology across industry and energy markets and help reduce the overall costs to society for decarbonisation. Shell led the development of the Peterhead CCS (PCCS) project in the UK, from which the learnings from the completed front end engineering design (FEED) phase of the project have been identified and captured. In line with the agreement with the UK government, who sponsored part of the FEED phase, the learnings have been shared publically for the benefit of future follow on projects. The project completed FEED in 2015, the same year in which the project was cancelled due to UK Government withdrawal of funding for the UK CCS Commercialisation Competition. The Peterhead CCS project FEED phase comprised design work for CO2 capture from the Peterhead gas fired power station using Shell Cansolv technology. The project design also encompassed pipeline transport of the CO2 through an existing pipeline to the CO2 subsurface storage site in the North Sea Goldeneye reservoir, utilising the existing offshore platform. This paper provides an overview of learnings from across both the technical and non-technical spectrums, including key technical CCS specific topics, as well as learnings from engagement with stakeholders, and development of regulatory frameworks. The learnings shared can be applied to the design of future CCS projects to reduce costs, optimise the technology, and realise public and regulatory support. The development of the FEED provided confidence that the construction and operation of the PCCS project was feasible and that the project was in a position to advance to the next stage of the development.

To inform future research and encourage environmentally-sensitive developments, this review aims to identify the most significant social and ecological issues associated with wave and tidal current energy generation. Modifications to wave climates, flow patterns, and marine habitats, particularly through increased underwater noise and collision risk, are identified as key ecological issues. Social acceptance of renewable energy is found to be closely linked to the level of stakeholder involvement and the public perception of renewable energy. The review concludes with a call for a more strategic and collaborative research effort between developers, academia, and the public sector to improve environmental monitoring standards and best practices for device and array design.

91760225	13867	2022.1925	Assessing household perception, autonomous adaptation and economic value of adaptation benefits: Evidence from West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia	Climate change is causing sea-level rise, intense and frequent storm surge flooding, and significant shoreline erosion in Malaysian coastal areas. Consequently, coastal properties, infrastructure, and livelihoods are threatened. It has become apparent that adaptation at the household and community level is necessary to offset the adverse impacts of coastal hazards. The community needs to be made aware of the risks, acquire knowledge about adaptation options, and be empowered to take their own actions. Public perception and preference are therefore crucial for design and implementation of effective planning for climate change. Thus, this study assesses households' perception, adaptation measures and empirically estimates willingness to pay and preference for planned adaptation measures to guide policy instruments through public engagement. In Malaysia, ten highly vulnerable coastal areas in the Selangor coast were surveyed at the household level (n 1/4 1016) through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Regarding households' perception and adaptation methods, most of the households in the highly exposed areas perceived less risk of inundation and sea-level rise threat and adopted less proactive adaptation and limited risk reduction be-haviours during the extreme event. The study found that 66.9\% of households were willing to pay for planned adaptation measures despite the limited income capabilities and in favour of moderate adaptation (23.9\%). The binomial and ordinal regression results indicated that the probability of willingness to pay for planned adaptation measures significantly increases with age, prior exposure to coastal hazards, awareness, risk perception, community participation, being affected by property damage and loss of income due to extreme events. With increased monthly household income and access to telecommunication services, households will probably pay higher for better adaptation measures. A significant amount of perceived yearly adaptation benefits in the coastal districts revealed the economic value of extensive (22,969.50 MYR/5462.43 USD), moderate (21,853.20 MYR/5196.96 USD) and minimal adaptation measures (8022.90 MYR/1907.94 USD) that can be utilised to incentivise coastal adaptation plans. The findings suggest policies to incorporate social values to reduce vulnerability, enhance community resilience, and contribute to the knowledge gap of adaptation research in the coastal areas.	risk perception; climate awareness; public engagement; factors affecting adaptation; willingness to pay	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760245	669	NA.11	LOCAL DIFFERENTIATION AND ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN COASTAL GHANA	This study investigates the perception of the impact of climate change on the livelihoods of small-scale fishing communities in the Western Region of Ghana. A mixed-method approach was employed, consisting of a survey of 400 fisherfolk households and 20 interviews with stakeholders. Changes in rainfall pattern, decreasing rainfall, stronger waves and storms that increase coastal erosion and cause persistent flooding were found to be the main effects of climate change on the livelihoods of small-scale coastal fisherfolk. Transnational fishing practices by fisherfolk in response to climate change contributed to the building of resilience of fishing households, while other adaptation strategies appeared to be insufficient in the long run. Coastal communities are not homogenous with respect to climate change impacts and corresponding adaptation strategies. Based on the empirical results, policy implications are suggested related to early warning systems and multiscalar marine planning.	small-scale fisheries; sustainable livelihoods and climate change; traditional ecological knowledge; multi-scalar marine planning; west africa	NA	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760247	243353	2021.15025	Determinant factors of protective behaviors regarding erosion and coastal flooding risk	The increasing vulnerability of coastal areas to climate change and hazards has the authorities seeking the best way to protect the population. Because it is essential for citizens to contribute to their own protection, it is increasingly necessary to take their knowledge and perceptions into account. Two studies have been conducted to identify the factors that could explain protective behavior regarding coastal erosion and flooding risks: a qualitative study using interviews with 32 inhabitants of municipalities exposed to coastal risks, and a quantitative study using questionnaires with 237 participants exposed to coastal erosion (N = 116) and coastal flooding (N = 121). Thematic content and statistical analysis (multiple linear regression) have been used. The results indicate that flooding is considered a personal risk with heightened involvement, and thus necessitates personal action for self-protection. Erosion appears to be a collective risk, impacting all inhabitants, as well as being slower and easier to anticipate. The physical characteristics of the phenomenon will thus determine the dynamics and functioning of social knowledge on risk assessment and on the motivation to protect oneself.	protective behavior; coastal risk; risk perception; vulnerability indicator; place attachment	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760248	7275	2019.783	Communicating Climate Change Oceanically: Sea Level Rise Information Increases Mitigation, Inundation, and Global Warming Acceptance	Cognitive impediments and global warming's gradual pace, among other factors, have inhibited some people from detecting climate change's everyday effects. This results in global warming often being perceived as a non-urgent, non-personal, threat that inhibits larger-scale collective action combatting climate change and public will regarding such action. Extreme weather events that global warming causes or exacerbates (e.g., hurricanes, flooding, heat, and droughts), however, are memorable due to their high emotional, social, and economic costs. Sea level rise is an especially salient American issue, given recent heightened storm surges, and the large population-segment who live in or near coastal areas with dangerous flooding risks. In this experiment, we show that providing American participants with U.S.-specific information about the economic and/or geographic/cartological effects and risks of sea level rise results in (a) an increased acceptance of oceanic rise as a phenomenon that is concerning and caused by global warming, and (b) an increased acceptance, in general, of global warming's anthropogenic nature. Communicating sea level rise information also led to (c) a general decrease in nationalism and (d) changes in the perceived effectiveness of mitigation strategies for sea level rise-specifically (d1) a decrease in the perceived effectiveness of constructing sea walls /dikes and (d2) an increase in the perceived effectiveness of phasing out fossil fuel usage. Overall, we find that communicating striking information about this oceanic by-product of global warming is an effective way to motivate acceptance and engagement with the issue of climate change in a reasonably broad manner. The experimental findings replicate, extend, and dovetail with prior experiments by our laboratory, bringing up to six the number of brief interventions (i.e., of roughly 5 or fewer minutes) that have been proven to increase people's science-normative beliefs about global warming. Our laboratory's website, HowGlobalWarmingWorks.org, offers samples of these materials, which additionally include surprising statistics, textual and video explanations of global warming's mechanism, and a contrast of Earth's temperature rise since the 1880's vs. the U.S. stock market rise since then.	cognition; sea-level-rise; global warming; nationalism; climate change; education; psychology	2019	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760255	7120	2019.753	Governance and stakeholder perspectives of managed re-alignment: adapting to sea level rise in the Inner Forth estuary, Scotland	With climate change, coastal areas are faced with unprecedented sea level rise and flooding, raising questions as to how societies will choose to adapt. One option is to strengthen existing sea walls to maintain current land uses; however, scientists, policy-makers and conservationists increasingly see the benefits of managed realignment, which is a nature-based coastal adaptation that involves the conversion of reclaimed farmland back to wetlands, allowing periodic local flooding in designated areas to reduce the risk of flooding downstream. We interviewed 16 local organisations, landowners and farmers and held workshops with 109 citizens living the Inner Forth estuary in eastern Scotland, to examine how managed realignment is supported by stakeholder attitudes and their engagement. Most of the farmers we interviewed prefer strengthened sea walls, to maintain their livelihoods and agricultural heritage. Citizens and local organisations were mainly supportive of managed realignment, because it provided wildlife and flood regulation benefits. However, we identified several barriers that could present obstacles to implementing managed realignment, for example, uncertainty whether it would support their principles of economic and rational decision-making. Our findings suggest that the local capacity to cope with rising sea levels is limited by lack of engagement with all relevant stakeholder groups, the limited scope of existing stakeholder partnerships and poor short-term funding prospects of landscape partnerships that would facilitate collaboration and discussion. We suggest that including citizens, landowners, farmers and industries would strengthen existing stakeholder deliberation and collaboration, and support the Inner Forth's transition towards a more sustainable future shoreline.	managed realignment; climate change adaptation; nature-based solutions; wetland restoration; participatory research; coastal management	2019	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760256	6695	2021.876	Success of coastal wetlands restoration is driven by sediment availability	Shorelines and their ecosystems are endangered by sea-level rise. Nature-based coastal protection is becoming a global strategy to enhance coastal resilience through the cost-effective creation, restoration and sustainable use of coastal wetlands. However, the resilience to sea-level rise of coastal wetlands created under Nature-based Solution has been assessed largely on a regional scale. Here we assess, using a meta-analysis, the difference in accretion, elevation, and sediment deposition rates between natural and restored coastal wetlands across the world. Our results show that restored coastal wetlands can trap more sediment and that the effectiveness of these restoration projects is primarily driven by sediment availability, not by wetland elevation, tidal range, local rates of sea-level rise, and significant wave height. Our results suggest that Nature-based Solutions can mitigate coastal wetland vulnerability to sea-level rise, but are effective only in coastal locations where abundant sediment supply is available. Coastal wetlands restored by Nature-based Solutions can trap more sediments than natural ones, and their efficiency is mainly determined by sediment supply, according to a meta-analysis of studies globally.

Because CO2 mixes rapidly in the atmosphere, air capture could operate anywhere and in principle reduce CO2 to preindustrial levels. We investigate the Kerguelen plateau in the Indian Ocean, which offers steady wind resources, vast subseafloor storage capacities, and minimal risk of economic damages or human inconvenience and harm. The efficiency of humidity swing driven air capture under humid and windy conditions is tested in the laboratory. Powered by wind, we estimate âˆ¼75 Mt CO2/yr could be collected using air capture and sequestered below seafloor or partially used for synfuel. Our analysis suggests that Kerguelen offers a remote and environmentally secure location for CO2 sequestration using renewable energy. Regional reservoirs could hold over 1500 Gt CO2, sequestering a large fraction of 21st century emissions.

91760258	6213	2011.258	Reserve design for uncertain responses of coral reefs to climate change	P>Rising sea temperatures cause mass coral bleaching and threaten reefs worldwide. We show how maps of variations in thermal stress can be used to help manage reefs for climate change. We map proxies of chronic and acute thermal stress and develop evidence-based hypotheses for the future response of corals to each stress regime. We then incorporate spatially realistic predictions of larval connectivity among reefs of the Bahamas and apply novel reserve design algorithms to create reserve networks for a changing climate. We show that scales of larval dispersal are large enough to connect reefs from desirable thermal stress regimes into a reserve network. Critically, we find that reserve designs differ according to the anticipated scope for phenotypic and genetic adaptation in corals, which remains uncertain. Attempts to provide a complete reserve design that hedged against different evolutionary outcomes achieved limited success, which emphasises the importance of considering the scope for adaptation explicitly. Nonetheless, 15\% of reserve locations were selected under all evolutionary scenarios, making them a high priority for early designation. Our approach allows new insights into coral holobiont adaptation to be integrated directly into an adaptive approach to management.	acclimation; adaptation; algorithm; connectivity; conservation; coral; marine reserve	2011	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760260	85304	2021.6838	Managing multiple pressures for cetaceans? conservation with an Ecosystem-Based Marine Spatial Planning approach	Despite the recognized important ecological role that cetaceans play in the marine environment, their protection is still scarcely enforced in the Mediterranean Sea even though this area is strongly threatened by local human pressures and climate change. The piecemeal of knowledge related to cetaceans? ecology and distribution in the basin undermines the capacity of addressing cetaceans? protection and identifying effective conservation strategies. In this study, an Ecosystem-Based Marine Spatial Planning (EB-MSP) approach is applied to assess human pressures on cetaceans and guide the designation of a conservation area in the Gulf of Taranto, Northern Ionian Sea (Central-eastern Mediterranean Sea). The Gulf of Taranto hosts different cetacean species that accomplish important phases of their life in the area. Despite this fact, the gulf does not fall within any area-based management tools (ABMTs) for cetacean conservation. We pin down the Gulf of Taranto being eligible for the designation of diverse ABMTs for conservation, both legally and non-legally binding. Through a risk-based approach, this study explores the cause-effect relationships that link any human activities and pressures exerted in the study area to potential effects on cetaceans, by identifying major drivers of potential impacts. These were found to be underwater noise, marine litter, ship collision, and competition and disturbance on preys. We draw some recommendations based on different sources of available knowledge produced so far in the area (i.e., empirical evidence, scientific and grey literature, and expert judgement) to boost cetaceans? conservation. Finally, we stress the need of sectoral coordination for the management of human activities by applying an EBMSP approach and valuing the establishment of an ABMT in the Gulf of Taranto.	cetaceans? conservation; risk based approach; management; multiple pressures; marine spatial planning; northern ionian sea (central-eastern; mediterranean sea)	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760265	303530	2020.2595	Assessment of fuel cell types for ships: Based on multi-criteria decision analysis	The maritime industry leading organization International Maritime Organization (IMO) is bringing more and more restrictive and effective rules on reducing greenhouse gas and air polluting emissions since the significant portion of the greenhouse gas emissions in the world are caused by commercial vessels. Therefore, an alternative energy source is seeking by maritime industry and fuel cells can play a major role in converting such energy sources into electrical energy. The aim of this study is to compare commercial fuel cell types that can be used in merchant ships and a maximum of 5 MW main engine power is considered due to the limited power output of fuel cells. The environmental and economical performances of fuel cell types were compared and criterionsâ€™ weightings were found according to expert points using the analytic hierarchy process. A final comparison table is formed giving evaluation points for each fuel cell type and weighting for each criterion depending on their importance in the maritime industry. Fuel cells are ranked by eight different criteria and according to experts, safety is the most important criterion and then followed by emissions, efficiency, cost, lifetime, power output, fuel type, and size, respectively. Among seven different fuel cell types; proton exchange membrane, alkaline, phosphoric acid, diesel oil using molten carbonate, liquefied natural gas using molten carbonate, diesel oil using solid oxide and liquefied natural gas using solid oxide fuel cells, the first three places are formed by diesel oil using molten carbonate fuel cell, proton exchange membrane fuel cell and diesel oil using solid oxide fuel cell which are received 4.053, 4.044 and 3.969 respectively from the total point 5.000. As a result, diesel oil using molten carbonate fuel cell, which takes place with a slight margin from proton exchange membrane fuel cell, has been found as the most suitable fuel cell type for ships. This study highlights that despite strict emission regulations, as a fuel, diesel oil is still a strong fuel option for ships with different energy conversion units like fuel cells.

91760273	58166	2022.5898	Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emission Assessment for Using Alternative Marine Fuels: A Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) Case Study	The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set decarbonisation goals for the shipping industry. As a result, shipowners and operators are preparing to use low- or zero-carbon alternative fuels. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emission performances are fundamental for choosing suitable marine fuels. However, the current regulations adopt tank-to-wake (TTW) emission assessment methods that could misrepresent the total climate impacts of fuels. To better understand the well-to-wake (WTW) GHG emission performances, this work applied the life cycle assessment (LCA) method to a very large crude carrier (VLCC) sailing between the Middle East and China to investigate the emissions. The life cycle GHG emission impacts of using alternative fuels, including liquified natural gas (LNG), methanol, and ammonia, were evaluated and compared with using marine gas oil (MGO). The bunkering site of the VLCC was in Zhoushan port, China. The MGO and LNG were imported from overseas, while methanol and ammonia were produced in China. Four production pathways for methanol and three production pathways for ammonia were examined. The results showed that, compared with MGO, using fossil energy-based methanol and ammonia has no positive effect in terms of annual WTW GHG emissions. The emission reduction effects of fuels ranking from highest to lowest were full solar and battery-based methanol, full solar and battery-based ammonia, and LNG. Because marine ammonia-fuelled engines have not been commercialised, laboratory data were used to evaluate the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The GHG emission reduction potential of ammonia can be exploited more effectively if the N2O emitted from engines is captured and disposed of through after-treatment technologies. This paper discussed three scenarios of N2O emission abatement ratios of 30\%, 50\%, and 90\%. The resulting emission reduction effects showed that using full solar and battery-based ammonia with 90\% N2O abatement performs better than using full solar and battery-based methanol. The main innovation of this work is realising the LCA GHG emission assessment for a deep-sea ship.	life cycle assessment; greenhouse gas; mgo; lng; methanol; ammonia; hydrogen; ship fuels	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760276	2344	2020.302	Tracing environmental and livelihood dynamics in a tropical coastal lagoon through the lens of multiple adaptive cycles	Understanding the long-term dynamics of social-ecological systems is critical to better inform sustainable management. Since Holling's adaptive cycle heuristic, published in 2001, substantial progress has been made to explore historical changes in agricultural, pastoral, and forest systems. However, the application of this heuristic in coastal fishery systems has been relatively rare. Using the Tam Giang Lagoon in Vietnam as an example of a rapidly changing environment, we explore the historical behavior of this tropical coastal social-ecological system (SES), associated livelihood pathways, and possible challenges for future livelihood adaptations through the lens of the adaptive cycle metaphor. Our analysis demonstrates that the present lagoon SES condition is the result of a series of historical events and reorganization attempts through two complete adaptive cycles. The lagoon's future vulnerability is tied to the intensification of human uses, prolonged ecological degradation, and intensifying climatic hazards. We show how the evolution of the lagoon SES resulted in divergent livelihood pathways that bring benefits to some users but also cause persistent constraints and sometimes irreversible losses to other users in shared common pool resources. A one-size-fits-all fishery management approach is therefore ill-suited for improving diverse livelihoods. We recommend that fishery policies take seriously the heterogeneity in livelihood pathways for sustainable lagoon management. We end by reflecting on the usefulness of the adaptive cycle heuristic in systematically exploring historical dynamics and identifying underlying drivers and feedbacks between the social and ecological components of complex fishery systems.	adaptive cycle; coastal lagoon; dynamics; livelihoodpathways; social-ecologicalsystems; vietnam	2020	Devi	Jean-Pierre	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760290	7624	2015.507	Flood warnings in coastal areas: how do experience and information influence responses to alert services?	Many studies discuss the economic and technical aspects of flood warnings. Less attention has been given to the social and behavioural patterns that affect alert services. In particular, the literature focuses on warnings activated in river basins or marine environments without providing clear evidence on Mediterranean coastal areas, even though these are subjected to growing flood risk related to climate change. This paper is a first attempt to bridge this gap. Our research develops an in-depth analysis of the village of Cesenatico on the Adriatic Sea coast. Here the municipality adopted two complementary warning systems: a siren and an alert via short message service (SMS). The analysis focuses on a survey conducted in 2011 and 2012 with 228 participants. The relationships between social and behavioural variables and warning services are investigated as well as flood preparedness and information dissemination. Qualitative evidence from informal interviews is used to support the understanding of key responses. The conclusions show how different social and behavioural patterns can influence the effectiveness and use of warning systems, regardless of the technology adopted and the structural mitigation measures implemented. Education, training and accountability are seen to be critical elements for implementation. Finally, the statistical output is used to suggest new questions and new directions for research.

91813150	102145	2019.6885	Using naturally occurring climate resilient corals to construct bleaching-resistant nurseries	Ecological restoration of forests, meadows, reefs, or other foundational ecosystems during climate change depends on the discovery and use of individuals able to withstand future conditions. For coral reefs, climate-tolerant corals might not remain tolerant in different environments because of widespread environmental adjustment of coral physiology and symbionts. Here, we test if parent corals retain their heat tolerance in nursery settings, if simple proxies predict successful colonies, and if heat-tolerant corals suffer lower growth or survival in normal settings. Before the 2015 natural bleaching event in American Samoa, we set out 800 coral fragments from 80 colonies of four species selected by prior tests to have a range of intraspecific natural heat tolerance. After the event, nursery stock from heat-tolerant parents showed two to three times less bleaching across species than nursery stock from less tolerant parents. They also retained higher individual genetic diversity through the bleaching event than did less heat-tolerant corals. The three best proxies for thermal tolerance were response to experimental heat stress, location on the reef, and thermal microclimate. Molecular biomarkers were also predictive but were highly species specific. Colony genotype and symbiont genus played a similarly strong role in predicting bleaching. Combined, our results show that selecting for host and symbiont resilience produced a multispecies coral nursery that withstood multiple bleaching events, that proxies for thermal tolerance in restoration can work across species and be inexpensive, and that different coral clones within species reacted very differently to bleaching.	coral resilience; climate change; bleaching; american samoa; restoration	2019	Fred	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91813152	11728	2019.1237	Responsive harvest control rules provide inherent resilience to adverse effects of climate change and scientific uncertainty	Climate change is altering marine ecosystem and fish stock dynamics worldwide. These effects add to scientific uncertainties that compromise fisheries management. Among the strategies that can respond to climate change and scientific uncertainty, modifications to harvest control rules (HCRs) might be among the most direct and impactful. We used a bioeconomic model to compare alternative HCRs in terms of biomass, yield, and profits in response to potential effects of climate change and scientific uncertainty, specifically simulated retrospective patterns, for 14 stocks on the Northeast Shelf of the United States. Our results suggest that a responsive HCR in which fishing mortality changes with measured changes in biomass builds inherent resilience to adverse effects of both climate change and scientific uncertainty relative to an HCR in which fishing mortality is precautionary but fixed. This was despite that fact that the HCR algorithm did not account for the climate effects modelled. A fixed fishing mortality HCR was effective when climate effects were negligible or beneficial. Scientific uncertainty further reduced biomass, yield, and profits by about the same magnitude as climate change. Our results suggest that simple changes to HCRs can be a readily implementable strategy for responding to climate change and scientific uncertainty.	climate change; harvest control rules; new england; retrospective pattern; scientific uncertainty	2019	Fred	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91813153	129280	2018.6230	Risk-sensitive planning for conserving coral reefs under rapid climate change	Coral reef ecosystems are seriously threatened by changing conditions in the ocean. Although many factors are implicated, climate change has emerged as a dominant and rapidly growing threat. Developing a long-term strategic plan for the conservation of coral reefs is urgently needed yet is complicated by significant uncertainty associated with climate change impacts on coral reef ecosystems. We use Modern Portfolio Theory to identify coral reef locations globally that, in the absence of other impacts, are likely to have a heightened chance of surviving projected climate changes relative to other reefs. Long-term planning that is robust to uncertainty in future conditions provides an objective and transparent framework for guiding conservation action and strategic investment. These locations constitute important opportunities for novel conservation investments to secure less vulnerable yet well-connected coral reefs that may, in turn, help to repopulate degraded areas in the event that the climate has stabilized.	climate change; connectivity; conservation; coral reef; cyclone; global; ocean warming; optimization; planning; portfolio theory	2018	Fred	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1
91813154	13315	2017.1077	Marine reserves can mitigate and promote adaptation to climate change	Strong decreases in greenhouse gas emissions are required to meet the reduction trajectory resolved within the 2015 Paris Agreement. However, even these decreases will not avert serious stress and damage to life on Earth, and additional steps are needed to boost the resilience of ecosystems, safeguard their wildlife, and protect their capacity to supply vital goods and services. We discuss how well-managed marine reserves may help marine ecosystems and people adapt to five prominent impacts of climate change: acidification, sea-level rise, intensification of storms, shifts in species distribution, and decreased productivity and oxygen availability, as well as their cumulative effects. We explore the role of managed ecosystems in mitigating climate change by promoting carbon sequestration and storage and by buffering against uncertainty in management, environmental fluctuations, directional change, and extreme events. We highlight both strengths and limitations and conclude that marine reserves are a viable low-tech, cost-effective adaptation strategy that would yield multiple cobenefits from local to global scales, improving the outlook for the environment and people into the future.	ecological insurance; marine protected areas; nature-based solution; mpa; global change	2017	Fred	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91813156	248133	2018.5602	Heading for the hills: climate-driven community relocations in the Solomon Islands and Alaska provide insight for a 1.5 degrees C future	Whilst future air temperature thresholds have become the centrepiece of international climate negotiations, even the most ambitious target of 1.5 degrees C will result in significant sea-level rise and associated impacts on human populations globally. Of additional concern in Arctic regions is declining sea ice and warming permafrost which can increasingly expose coastal areas to erosion particularly through exposure to wave action due to storm activity. Regional variability over the past two decades provides insight into the coastal and human responses to anticipated future rates of sea-level rise under 1.5 degrees C scenarios. Exceeding 1.5 degrees C will generate sea-level rise scenarios beyond that currently experienced and substantially increase the proportion of the global population impacted. Despite these dire challenges, there has been limited analysis of how, where and why communities will relocate inland in response. Here, we present case studies of local responses to coastal erosion driven by sea-level rise and warming in remote indigenous communities of the Solomon Islands and Alaska, USA, respectively. In both the Solomon Islands and the USA, there is no national government agency that has the organisational and technical capacity and resources to facilitate a community-wide relocation. In the Solomon Islands, communities have been able to draw on flexible land tenure regimes to rapidly adapt to coastal erosion through relocations. These relocations have led to ad hoc fragmentation of communities into smaller hamlets. Government-supported relocation initiatives in both countries have been less successful in the short term due to limitations of land tenure, lacking relocation governance framework, financial support and complex planning processes. These experiences from the Solomon Islands and USA demonstrate the urgent need to create a relocation governance framework that protects people's human rights.	sea-level rise; climate change; relocations; solomon islands; alaska	2018	Fred	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been widely advocated for conserving and managing marine biodiversity yet, despite extensive research, their benefits for conserving non-target species and wider ecosystem functions remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that MPAs can increase the resilience of coral reef communities to natural disturbances, including coral bleaching, coral diseases, Acanthaster planci outbreaks and storms. Using a 20-year time series from Australia's Great Barrier Reef, we show that within MPAs, (1) reef community composition was 21-38\% more stable; (2) the magnitude of disturbance impacts was 30\% lower and (3) subsequent recovery was 20\% faster that in adjacent unprotected habitats. Our results demonstrate that MPAs can increase the resilience of marine communities to natural disturbance possibly through herbivory, trophic cascades and portfolio effects.	acanthaster planci; benthos; biodiversity; bleaching; crown-of-thorns starfish; cyclone; disturbance; fish; great barrier reef; marine reserves	2016	Fred	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) is capable of reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and surface warming and addressing ocean acidification. Here, we simulate global and regional responses to alkalinity (ALK) addition (0.25gPmolALKgyrg;'1) over the period 2020-2100 using the CSIRO-Mk3L-COAL Earth System Model, under high (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5; RCP8.5) and low (RCP2.6) emissions. While regionally there are large changes in alkalinity associated with locations of AOA, globally we see only a very weak dependence on where and when AOA is applied. On a global scale, while we see that under RCP2.6 the carbon uptake associated with AOA is only g;1/4 60g% of the total, under RCP8.5 the relative changes in temperature are larger, as are the changes in pH (140g%) and aragonite saturation state (170g%). The simulations reveal AOA is more effective under lower emissions, therefore the higher the emissions the more AOA is required to achieve the same reduction in global warming and ocean acidification. Finally, our simulated AOA for 2020-2100 in the RCP2.6 scenario is capable of offsetting warming and ameliorating ocean acidification increases at the global scale, but with highly variable regional responses.

91813160	25986	2015.1565	Can macroalgae contribute to blue carbon? An Australian perspective	Macroalgal communities in Australia and around the world store vast quantities of carbon in their living biomass, but their prevalence of growing on hard substrata means that they have limited capacity to act as long-term carbon sinks. Unlike other coastal blue carbon habitats such as seagrasses, saltmarshes and mangroves, they do not develop their own organic-rich sediments, but may instead act as a rich carbon source and make significant contributions in the form of detritus to sedimentary habitats by acting as a ``carbon donor{''} to ``receiver sites{''} where organic material accumulates. The potential for storage of this donated carbon however, is dependent on the decay rate during transport and the burial efficiency at receiver sites. To better understand the potential contribution of macroalgal communities to coastal blue carbon budgets, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using key words, including carbon sequestration, macroalgal distribution, abundance and productivity to provide an estimation of the total amount of carbon stored in temperate Australian macroalgae. Our most conservative calculations estimate 109.9 TgC is stored in living macroalgal biomass of temperate Australia, using a coastal area covering 249,697 km(2). Estimates derived for tropical and subtropical regions contributed an additional 23.2 Tg C. By extending the search to include global studies we provide a broader context and rationale for the study, contributing to the global aspects of the review. In addition, we discuss the potential role of calcium carbonate-containing macroalgae, consider the dynamic nature of macroalgal populations in the context of climate change, and identify the knowledge gaps that once addressed will enable robust quantification of macroalgae in marine biogeochemical cycling of carbon. We conclude that macroalgal communities have the potential to make ecologically meaningful contributions toward global blue carbon sequestration, as donors, but given that the fate of detached macroalgal biomass remains unclear, further research is needed to quantify this contribution.

91813161	6001	2018.623	Building adaptive capacity to climate change in tropical coastal communities	To minimize the impacts of climate change on human wellbeing, governments, development agencies, and civil society organizations have made substantial investments in improving people's capacity to adapt to change. Yet to date, these investments have tended to focus on a very narrow understanding of adaptive capacity. Here, we propose an approach to build adaptive capacity across five domains: the assets that people can draw upon in times of need; the flexibility to change strategies; the ability to organize and act collectively; learning to recognize and respond to change; and the agency to determine whether to change or not.

Foundations are introduced in mainly sandy sediments, and the resulting artificial reef effect is considered one of the main impacts on the marine environment. We investigated the macrobenthic fouling community that developed on the concrete foundations of the first wind turbines built in Belgian marine waters. We observed a clear vertical zonation, with a distinction between a Telmatogetonjaponicus dominated splash zone, a high intertidal zone characterised by Semibalanus balanoides, followed by a mussel belt in the low intertidalâ€“shallow subtidal. In the deep subtidal, the species turnover was initially very high, but the community was soon dominated by few species (Jassa herdmani, Actiniaria spp. and Tubularia spp.), and only seasonal dynamics within this species assemblage were observed after 1â€“1Â½Â years. Ten non-indigenous species (NIS) were found. In the intertidal, eight out of the seventeen typical intertidal species observed were NIS, while only two out of a species pool of 80 species were NIS in the deep subtidal. NIS were found to use the foundations to expand their range and strengthen their strategic position in the area.

While ambitious mitigation and adaptation are both needed, the ocean provides major opportunities for action to reduce climate change globally and its impacts on vital ecosystems and ecosystem services. A comprehensive and systematic assessment of 13 global- and local-scale, ocean-based measures was performed to help steer the development and implementation of technologies and actions toward a sustainable outcome. We show that (1) all measures have tradeoffs and multiple criteria must be used for a comprehensive assessment of their potential, (2) greatest benefit is derived by combining global and local solutions, some of which could be implemented or scaled-up immediately, (3) some measures are too uncertain to be recommended yet, (4) political consistency must be achieved through effective cross-scale governance mechanisms, (5) scientific effort must focus on effectiveness, co-benefits, disbenefits, and costs of poorly tested as well as new and emerging measures.	climate change; ocean acidification; ocean solutions; global; local; governance	2018	Yunne	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91813164	150998	2016.7933	Reversal of ocean acidification enhances net coral reef calcification	Approximately one-quarter of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere each year is absorbed by the global oceans, causing measurable declines in surface ocean pH, carbonate ion concentration ({[}CO32-]), and saturation state of carbonate minerals (Omega)(1). This process, referred to as ocean acidification, represents a major threat to marine ecosystems, in particular marine calcifiers such as oysters, crabs, and corals. Laboratory and field studies(2,3) have shown that calcification rates of many organisms decrease with declining pH, [}CO32-], and Omega. Coral reefs are widely regarded as one of the most vulnerable marine ecosystems to ocean acidification, in part because the very architecture of the ecosystem is reliant on carbonate-secreting organisms(4). Acidification-induced reductions in calcification are projected to shift coral reefs from a state of net accretion to one of net dissolution this century(5). While retrospective studies show large-scale declines in coral, and community, calcification over recent decades(6-12), determining the contribution of ocean acidification to these changes is difficult, if not impossible, owing to the confounding effects of other environmental factors such as temperature. Here we quantify the net calcification response of a coral reef flat to alkalinity enrichment, and show that, when ocean chemistry is restored closer to pre-industrial conditions, net community calcification increases. In providing results from the first seawater chemistry manipulation experiment of a natural coral reef community, we provide evidence that net community calcification is depressed compared with values expected for pre-industrial conditions, indicating that ocean acidification may already be impairing coral reef growth.

91813165	317203	2019.14409	Low genetic connectivity in a fouling amphipod among man-made structures in the southern North Sea	Offshore environments are increasingly invaded by man-made structures that form hard-substrate habitats for many marine species. Examples include oil and gas platforms, wind turbines and shipwrecks. One of the hypothesised effects is an increased genetic connectivity among natural populations due to new populations growing on man-made structures that may act as stepping stones. However, few data are available on genetic connectivity among organisms inhabiting artificial offshore structures. Here, we present a study on the common fouling amphipod Jassa herdmani from offshore structures in the southern North Sea. Partial mitochondrial DNA sequences (cytochrome-c-oxidase 1, N = 514) were obtained from artificial structures at 17 locations in the southern North Sea, including 13 shipwrecks, 2 wind turbines and 2 platforms. Samples from these locations were significantly differentiated, meaning that strong population structure exists for this species in the area. Levels of intraspecific variation were consistent with stable population sizes. No evidence was found for isolation by distance. Using coalescent simulations, the oldest population subdivision events were estimated to date back to the time the study area was flooded following the Last Glacial Maximum. We therefore tentatively conclude that J. herdmani may have colonised man-made structures from previously existing populations on the sea floor, and that the increase in offshore installations has not led to an overall increase in genetic connectivity for this species.

91760301	13061	2022.1814	Household external vulnerability due to climate change in Selangor coast of Malaysia	Coastal areas are already facing various risks due to increasing climate-related hazards that are likely to amplify with changing climate and make the households living in these areas even more vulnerable in terms of livelihoods and living conditions. This study attempted to evaluate vulnerability mapping of the coastal areas due to climate change using an integrative external and internal framework from three dimensions at the household level: exposure (E) to coastal hazards, sensitivity (S) due to demographic, socio-economic and structural characteristics and adaptive capacity (AC) relating to available assets and adaptive behaviour to cope with climate change impacts. Primary data on relevant indicators for assessing vulnerability were collected from ten historically eroded critical coastal areas along Selangor coastline, Malaysia. Using a pre-tested questionnaire, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 1050 randomly selected households. The collected data were used to estimate a composite vulnerability index (VI) from E, S, and AC indices. The vulnerability was classified according to four categories (low, moderate, high, very high) based on quarterly percentile distribution to evaluate the status. The results showed that about 96\% of households had moderate exposure, and 4\% had high exposure to climate change. All of the households exhibited moderate sensitivity. Low adaptive capacity was observed in 76\% of households, moderate adaptive capacity in 17\% and high adaptive capacity in 7\%. Composite VI indicated that eight coastal areas (84\% of households) are highly vulnerable, and two coastal areas (16\%) are moderately vulnerable to climate change. The high vulnerability was attributed to increased exposure to shoreline erosion, high-risk perception, limited income, weak housing structures and lack of financial capital. The variation in exposure, socio-economic characteristics and available capitals resulted in different degrees of vulnerability in Selangor coastal areas indicating the diversified need for proactive adaptation planning at the local level. It is recommended that an appropriate mix of equitable community-based adaptations that adequately address the needs of the most vulnerable, focusing on poverty reduction, financial incentives and livelihood resilience and climate policies based on equity and justice, cultural and societal values are implemented to contribute to rural coastal households' resilience. This study is limited by the selective indicators of the external household vulnerability and subjective range of vulnerability classification.	integrated index; community perspective; socio-economic indicators; climate-related hazards; coastal household	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760304	6412	2011.273	On the economics of coastal adaptation solutions in an uncertain world	The economics of adaptation to climate change relies heavily on comparisons of the benefits and costs of adaptation options that can range from changes in policy to implementing specific projects. Since these benefits are derived from damages avoided by any such adaptation, they are critically dependent on the specification of a baseline. The current exercise paper reinforces this point in an environment that superimposes stochastic coastal storm events on two alternative sea level rise scenarios from two different baselines: one assumes perfect economic efficiency of the sort that could be supported by the availability of actuarially fair insurance and a second in which fundamental market imperfections significantly impair society's ability to spread risk. We show that the value of adaptation can be expressed in terms of differences in expected outcomes damages only if the effected community has access to efficient risk-spreading mechanisms or reflects risk neutrality in its decision-making structure. Otherwise, the appropriate metric for measuring the benefits of adaptation must be derived from certainty equivalents. In these cases, increases in decision-makers' aversion to risk increase the economic value of adaptations that reduce expected damages and diminish the variance of their inter-annual variability. For engineering and other adaptations that involve significant up-front expense followed by ongoing operational cost, increases in decision-makers' aversion increase the value of adaptation and therefore move the date of economically efficient implementation closer to the present.

91760313	13766	2022.1909	A new framework for rapidly assessing national adaptation policies: an application to small island developing states in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans	Adapting to climate change is becoming a routine and necessary component of planning at all levels. In the case of small island developing states (SIDS), the successful development, implementation and evaluation of national-level adaptation policies are especially important because of their disproportionate vulnerability. The status of adaptation policies in these countries, however, is poorly understood and documented, particularly for the Atlantic, Indian Oceans, Mediterranean and South China Seas (AIMS) region. This is so largely because of minimal mainstream research interest in these small nations. This paper helps fill this gap. It develops an Adaptation Policy Assessment Framework that facilitates a rapid qualitative assessment of countries' national adaptation policies. It applies the framework to seven representative policies across six of the nine SIDS in the AIMS region-Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, Maldives, Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles and Singapore. It finds that countries are mostly successful in identifying climate and climate-related vulnerabilities and linking associated risks to other national development priorities such as poverty reduction. Countries, however, struggle with establishing and maintaining systems to review and improve adaptation interventions, which is not entirely unique to them or their circumstances. This paper's findings provide critical points of reflection for countries preparing and revising their National Adaptation Plans in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. They also contribute to a broader understanding of the complexities of climate policy development in small jurisdictions.	adaptation policy assessment (a-pass) framework; atlantic; indian oceans; mediterranean and south china seas (aims) region; climate change adaptation; climate policy; small island developing states (sids); united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc)	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

However, the processes involved in delivering this particular service have not been fully understood. The objective of the present review was to compile the main results in the literature regarding the study of shoreline protection delivered by coral reefs, identifying the main threats climate change imposes to the service, and discuss mitigation and recovery strategies that can and have been applied to these ecosystems. While different zones of a reef have been associated with different levels of wave energy and wave height attenuation, more information is still needed regarding the capacity of different reef morphologies to deliver shoreline protection. Moreover, the synergy between the main threats imposed by climate change to coral reefs has also not been thoroughly investigated. Recovery strategies are being tested and while there are numerous mitigation options, the challenge remains as to how to implement them and monitor their efficacy.

91760320	5459	2015.365	Environmental Security is Homeland Security: Climate Disruption as the Ultimate Disaster Risk Multiplier	There are several important linkages among environmental hazards and crises caused (at least in part) by human-caused global warming, and both homeland security and national security risk analysis and practice. Increasingly robust research has demonstrated (1) anthropogenic climate change and its interaction with other human environmental pressures (population, pollution, and resource consumption growth); (2) worsening climate disruption patterns and disaster projections, showing long-range risk to the very survival of human civilization; and ( 3) links among environmental hazards, human economic and political instability, and development of political violence. This paper discusses how and why environmental security (ES) and homeland security (HS) are linked, including the threat-multiplying aspect of climate disruption risk factors; briefly contextualizes their growing interconnectedness in both theory and policy practice; and reviews some of what is most recently known about the science of climate disruption. It reviews disaster mitigation and resilient adaptation policy implications of climate variables such as extreme heat and drought, extreme storms, sea level rise, ocean ecosystem damage, and food and water crises. Most U.S. government security-related organizations now incorporate HS-ES mission statements, but current environmental security risk management and planning investment is insufficient, and burdened by political obstruction and costly scientific uncertainties.

91760332	254841	2019.190	Community structure dynamics and carbon stock change of rehabilitated mangrove forests in Sulawesi, Indonesia	To date, discourse associated with the potential application of â€œblue carbonâ€ within real-world carbon markets has focused on blue carbon as a mitigation strategy in the context of avoided deforestation (e.g., REDD+). Here, we report structural dynamics and carbon storage gains from mangrove sites that have undergone rehabilitation to ascertain whether reforestation can complement conservation activities and warrant project investment. Replicated sites at two locations with contrasting geomorphic conditions were selected, Tiwoho and Tanakeke on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. These locations are representative of high (Tiwoho, deep muds and silty substrates) and low (Tanakeke, shallow, coralline sands) productivity mangrove ecosystems. They share a similar management history of clearing and conversion for aquaculture before restorative activities were undertaken using the practice of Ecological Mangrove Rehabilitation (EMR). Species diversity and mean biomass carbon storage gains after 10Â yr of regrowth from the high productivity sites of Tiwoho (49.2Â Â±Â 9.1Â MgÂ CÂ·ha âˆ’1 Â·yr âˆ’1 ) are already almost of one-third of mean biomass stocks exhibited by mature forests (167.8Â Â±Â 30.3Â MgÂ CÂ·ha âˆ’1 Â·yr âˆ’1 ). Tiwoho's EMR sites, on average, will have offsetÂ all biomass C that was initially lost through conversion within the next 11Â yr, a finding in marked contrast to the minimal carbon gains observed on the low productivity, low diversity, coral atoll EMR sites of Tanakeke (1.1Â Â±Â 0.4 MgÂ CÂ·ha âˆ’1 Â·yr âˆ’1 ). These findings highlight the importance of geomorphic and biophysical site selection if the primary purpose of EMR is intended to maximize carbon sequestration gains.

Through observations, qualitative interviews, and archival reviews, we explore the dynamics of livelihood change and analyse the diverse factors that have been influencing options and adaptation over time. The results reveal that both villages have undergone profound changes in livelihoods and productive activities on several occasions. While the villages' histories, geographies, and cultures are different, similarities in long-term trends include the transition from land-based to marine resources and the decline of small-scale agriculture. Our analysis illuminates the deep connections between local livelihoods and national as well as global political-economic processes, which favour extraction and export of natural resources throughout the period investigated, whereby resource access and market mechanisms create and constrict adaptation options for the villagers. Gradual environmental changes, such as erosion, and episodic events, such as hurricanes, have also influenced livelihood shifts and adaptations in combination with a wide range of political-economic factors. Despite the demonstrated importance of the influence of history and dimensions of political economy on contemporary adaptation options in the communities studied, the literature on climate change adaptation inadequately accounts for these factors. This paper adds new perspectives to current debates in climate change research by emphasising that longer temporal dimensions of livelihood change are important for understanding the current context for adaptation.	livelihood change; coastal; adaptation; belize	2016	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

In view of the potential implications for coastal populations and ecosystems worldwide, we investigate, from an ice-dynamic perspective, the possibility of delaying sea-level rise by pumping ocean water onto the surface of the Antarctic ice sheet. We find that due to wave propagation ice is discharged much faster back into the ocean than would be expected from a pure advection with surface velocities. The delay time depends strongly on the distance from the coastline at which the additional mass is placed and less strongly on the rate of sea-level rise that is mitigated. A millennium-scale storage of at least 80\% of the additional ice requires placing it at a distance of at least 700 km from the coastline. The pumping energy required to elevate the potential energy of ocean water to mitigate the currently observed 3 mmyr(-1) will exceed 7\% of the current global primary energy supply. At the same time, the approach offers a comprehensive protection for entire coastlines particularly including regions that cannot be protected by dikes.

The primary data were collected from two villages of southwestern coastal areas of Bangladesh using questionnaire survey and interviews of the key informants. The data were analysed using the descriptive and inferential statistics. This paper reveals that the disaster management measures have a significant role to lessen the impacts of the cyclonic event, especially in pre-disaster preparedness, cyclone warning message dissemination, evacuation and post-disaster rehabilitation. The households, who have access to shelter, find weather forecast regularly and adopted pre-disaster awareness measures are relatively less susceptible to hazard's impacts. The disaster management measures undertaken by individuals and GOs and NGOs help coastal people to save their lives and property from the negative impacts of cyclones. The analysis shows that the NGOs' role is more effective and efficient than the GOs in cyclone disaster management. This paper identifies distance to shelter, participation in disaster training, efficient warning, etc. as the influential factors of vulnerability cyclones. The analysis finds the households as less affected who have adopted disaster preparedness measures. However, this paper concludes that the effective and proper disaster management and mitigation measures are very crucial to shield the lives and properties of the Bangladeshi coastal people.	vulnerability factors; disaster mitigation; cyclone impacts; cyclone aila; bangladesh	2018	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760354	5457	2021.729	Identifying and mitigating risks to completion of small grant climate change adaptation projects: evidence from the Pacific	Over recent decades, substantial funding from a variety of sources has been directed towards climate change adaptation projects in Pacific Island countries. There remains, however, considerable uncertainty about which factors influence adaptation project completion, as a pre-cursor to effective adaptation. In this study, we empirically establish the links between project attributes (duration, funding, cash co-financing, in-kind contributions, location, and adaptation approach) and whether a project is likely to complete or be terminated. We examine this issue by developing a logistic regression model to predict the probability of completion for small-scale climate change adaptation projects using a new dataset of 190 projects in the South Pacific (with end dates ranging from November 1995 to May 2016) that were financed through the Global Environment Facility Small Grants Programme. Empirical results suggest that all else equal, such a project was more likely to complete if it was shorter, received more co-financing cash input and in-kind support from other donors and project partners, was explicitly targeted towards climate change adaptation, focused on a single adaptation approach, and was undertaken in Micronesia or Fiji. Our results can be used to help funders and project proponents design projects to mitigate the risks of non-completion, particularly in high-risk settings. These findings should not be misinterpreted to undermine the importance of continued investment in adaptation projects across the whole of South Pacific region.	adaptive capacity; small-island developing states (sids); adaptation outcomes; quantitative analysis; project-specific; ecosystem-based adaptation	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760365	11673	2021.1585	Augmenting coral adaptation to climate change via coral gardening (the nursery phase)	Unceasing climate change and anthropogenic impacts on coral reefs worldwide lead the needs for augmenting adaptive potential of corals. Currently, the most successful approach for restoring degraded reefs is `coral gardening', where corals are farmed in underwater nurseries, then outplanted to damaged reefs. Dealing with enhanced coral adaptation, the `coral gardening' approach is conceptually structured here within a hierarchical list of five encircling tiers that include all restoration activities, focusing on the nursery phase. Each tier encompasses all the activities performed in the levels below it hierarchically. The first is the `coral mariculture' tier, followed by the `ecological engineering' tier. The third is the adaptation-based reef restoration (ABRR) tier, preceding the fourth ('ecosystem seascape') and the fifth ('ecosystem services') tiers. The ABRR tier is further conceptualized and its constituent five classes (phenotypic plasticity, assisted migration, epigenetics, coral chimerism, holobiont modification) are detailed. It is concluded that the nursery phase of the `gardening' tenet may further serve as a platform to enhance the adaptation capacities of corals to climate change through the five ABBR classes. Employing the `gardening' tiers in reef restoration without considering ABRR will scarcely be able to meet global targets for healthy reef ecosystems in the future.	reef restoration; gardening; ecological engineering; phenotypic plasticity; assisted migration; holobiont modification; microbiome; epigenetics; chimerism; ecosystem services	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760367	299832	2021.5661	Deriving Nickel (Ni(II)) and Chromium (Cr(III)) Based Environmentally Safe Olivine Guidelines for Coastal Enhanced Silicate Weathering	Enhanced silicate weathering (ESW) by spreading finely ground silicate rock along the coastal zone to remove atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is a proposed climate change mitigation technique. The abundant and fast-dissolving mineral olivine has received the most attention for this application. However, olivine contains nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr), which may pose a risk to marine biota during a gigaton-scale ESW application. Herein we derive a first guideline for coastal olivine dispersal based on existing marine environmental quality standards (EQS) for Ni and Cr. Results show that benthic biota are at the highest risk when olivine and its associated trace metals are mixed in the surface sediment. Specifically, depending on local sedimentary Ni concentrations, 0.059-1.4 kg of olivine m-2of seabed could be supplied without posing risks for benthic biota. Accordingly, globally coastal ESW could safely sequester only 0.51-37 Gt of CO2in the 21st century. On the basis of current EQS, we conclude that adverse environmental impacts from Ni and Cr release could reduce the applicability of olivine in coastal ESW. Our findings call for more in-depth studies on the potential toxicity of olivine toward benthic marine biota, especially in regard to bioavailability and metal mixture toxicity. Â© 2021 The Authors.

91760370	5609	2014.302	Rapid assessment of fisheries species sensitivity to climate change	Climate change driven alterations in the distribution and abundance of marine species, and the timing of their life history events (phenology), are being reported around the globe. However, we have limited capacity to detect and predict these responses, even for comparatively well studied commercial fishery species. Fisheries provide significant socio-economic benefits for many coastal communities, and early warning of potential changes to fish stocks will provide managers and other stakeholders with the best opportunity to adapt to these impacts. Rapid assessment methods that can estimate the sensitivity of species to climate change in a wide range of contexts are needed. This study establishes an objective, flexible and cost effective framework for prioritising future ecological research and subsequent investment in adaptation responses in the face of resource constraints. We build on an ecological risk assessment framework to assess relative sensitivities of commercial species to climate change drivers, specifically in relation to their distribution, abundance and phenology, and demonstrate our approach using key species within the fast warming region of south-eastern Australia. Our approach has enabled fisheries managers to understand likely changes to fisheries under a range of climate change scenarios, highlighted critical research gaps and priorities, and assisted marine industries to identify adaptation strategies that maximise positive outcomes.

91760372	5486	NA.81	Landlessness as the key challenge to climate change adaptation of the rural poor in Bangladesh: an empirical study	Bangladesh is ranked top among the locations most affected locations by extreme weather events over the last two decades and one of the potential victims of the consequences of climate change. Around 3.26 million rural Bangladeshi households are landless. These landless households usually constitute the poorest and most vulnerable groups in Bangladesh and are the first victims of climatic hazards. Despite the adaptation measures taken by the government and non-governmental organizations, landlessness generates constraints to adapt to the changing environment. Taking the above premises, this paper principally aims to unveil how landlessness poses challenges for the rural poor of Bangladesh in their endeavor to adapt to already emerging conditions of climate change. Based on qualitative interviews of relevant stakeholders, this paper finds that landlessness is a key challenge to the climate change adaptation process as it hinders livelihoods and income-generating activities of the people living in rural and coastal regions. Moreover, this study finds that landless people living near urban spaces are better placed to migrate to the cities for livelihoods and shelter. This study also adds insightful evidence suggesting that lack of access to land or land entitlement is a major setback to the existing climate change adaptation policy in Bangladesh.	climate change; adaptation; landlessness; rural poor; bangladesh	NA	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760375	299560	2021.5655	Recovery of Alkaline Earth Metals from Desalination Brine for Carbon Capture and Sodium Removal	Because carbon dioxide adsorbs the radiation from the Sun and the Earthâ€™s surface, global warming has become a severe problem in this century. Global warming causes many environmental problems such as heatwave, desertification, and erratic rainfall. Above all, erratic rainfall makes people have insufficient freshwater. To solve this problem, desalination technology has been developed in many countries. Although desalination technology can provide freshwater, it produces brine as well (producing 1 L of freshwater would result in 1 L of brine). The brine will decrease the dissolved oxygen in the sea and affect the organismâ€™s habitat. In this study, magnesium and calcium from desalination brine were recovered in the form of magnesium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide by adjusting the pH value for carbon capture and sodium removal. Magnesium hydroxide would turn into magnesium carbonate through contacting CO2 in saturated amine carriers. Calcium hydroxide was added to the brine and reacted with CO2 (modified Solvay process). Sodium in brine would then be precipitated in the form of sodium bicarbonate. After removing sodium, brine can be released back into the ocean, or other valuable metals can be extracted from brine without the side effect of sodium. The results revealed that 288 K of 3-Amino-1-propanol could capture 15 L (26.9 g) of CO2 and that 25 g/L of Ca(OH)2 at 288 K was the optimal parameter to remove 7000 ppm sodium and adsorb 16 L (28.7 g) of CO2 in the modified Solvay process. In a nutshell, this research aims to simultaneously treat the issue of CO2 emission and desalination brine by combining the amines carrier method and the modified Solvay process.

91760378	2359	2021.336	Measuring Small Island Disaster Resilience Towards Sustainable Coastal and Fisheries Tourism: The Case of Guimaras, Philippines	Small islands have unique environmental characteristics that make them prone or vulnerable to natural and human-induced hazards. The ability of a community to measure and assess its own characteristics (i.e., connectedness, risk and vulnerability, procedures on disaster planning, response and recovery, and available resources) contributes to the improvement of its capacity to better deal with, survive, and recover from disasters. Thus, we undertook this study to measure the resilience of a small island community using a tool developed by the Torrens Resilience Institute. We conducted a survey among 37 local government officials and 192 local community residents in the Island Province of Guimaras from August to December 2018 using a structured questionnaire following a simple random sampling method. Our results show that Guimaras is facing various natural and anthropogenic hazards. However, local officials and community residents agreed that Guimaras is in the ``Going Well Zone{''} (i.e., the island community is likely to be extremely resilient to any disaster) and that there is no significant difference (t-test, alpha = 0.05) in their ratings on disaster preparedness. As sun, sand, and sea tourism is a growing industry worldwide, the assessment that small island tourist destinations such as Guimaras is a resilient community would have positive impacts on the tourism industry, possibility leading to the sustainable development of coastal communities with tourism as a major source of supplemental or alternative livelihoods while reducing pressure on overexploited fish stocks.	small island; community disaster resilience; the torrens resilience institute framework; sustainable tourism; island province of guimaras; philippines	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760384	300468	2021.1895	Analysis and Modeling the Energy System of a Chemical Tanker by LEAP	Maritime transportation has been a cost-effective option among other transport modes. Meanwhile, this demand has been increasing day by day because of the expanding global economy. The ships are one of the most important transport and trade vehicles in the world; 90% of the world trade is carried out by maritime transport, and this sector plays a crucial role in climate change and global warming because it is one of the key sectors leading to emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas (GHG). In other sectors that lead to CO2 emissions, i.e., energy production, manufacturing industry, and heating in residences, energy efficiency has been improved and emissions have been reduced significantly. However, there has been no net reduction in the transport sector; total CO2 emissions have also increased because of the continuous increase in freight and passenger traffic, although efficiency has increased. Increasing the energy efficiency of a ship allows for fuel consumption reduction and GHG emissions. In this study, the energy system of a chemical tanker ship was analyzed and then modeled by using the long-range energy alternatives planning system, a widely used platform for energy policy analysis and climate change mitigation assessment, including a comprehensive energy flow diagram, namely, reference energy system. A base scenario was developed, and the ship's energy systemwas convenient to be analyzed and evaluated in terms of technical, economic, and environmental aspects, including low-emission development strategies, to comply with marine engine regulations of the International Maritime Organization.

91760387	6916	2016.540	A review of climate change and the implementation of marine biodiversity legislation in the United Kingdom	1. Marine legislation, the key means by which the conservation of marine biodiversity is achieved, has been developing since the 1960s. In recent decades, an increasing focus on `holistic' policy development is evident, compared with earlier `piecemeal' sectoral approaches. Important marine legislative tools being used in the United Kingdom, and internationally, include the designation of marine protected areas and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) with its aim of meeting `Good Environmental Status' (GES) for European seas by 2020. 2. There is growing evidence of climate change impacts on marine biodiversity, which may compromise the effectiveness of any legislation intended to promote sustainable marine resource management. 3. A review of key marine biodiversity legislation relevant to the UK shows climate change was not considered in the drafting of much early legislation. Despite the huge increase in knowledge of climate change impacts in recent decades, legislation is still limited in how it takes these impacts into account. There is scope, however, to account for climate change in implementing much of the legislation through (a) existing references to environmental variability; (b) review cycles; and (c) secondary legislation and complementary policy development. 4. For legislation relating to marine protected areas (e.g. the EC Habitats and Birds Directives), climate change has generally not been considered in the site-designation process, or for ongoing management, with the exception of the Marine (Scotland) Act. Given that changing environmental conditions (e.g. rising temperatures and ocean acidification) directly affect the habitats and species that sites are designated for, how this legislation is used to protect marine biodiversity in a changing climate requires further consideration. 5. Accounting for climate change impacts on marine biodiversity in the development and implementation of legislation is vital to enable timely, adaptive management responses. Marine modelling can play an important role in informing management decisions.

This improved performance measurement can support the evaluation of existing uncertainty and scepticism in selecting NBS over the artificially built concrete structures or grey approaches by addressing the questions of performance precariousness. Remote sensing technical developments, however, take time to shift toward a state of operational readiness for monitoring the progress of NBS in place (e.g. green NBS growth rate, their changes and effectiveness through time). More research is required to develop a holistic approach, which could routinely and continually monitor the performance of NBS over a large scale of intervention. This performance evaluation could increase the ecological and socio-economic benefits of NBS, and also create high levels of their acceptance and confidence by overcoming To bring to fruition the capability of nature-based solutions (NBS) in mitigating hydro-meteorological risks (HMRs) and facilitate their widespread uptake require a consolidated knowledge-base related to their monitoring methods, efficiency, functioning and the ecosystem services they provide. We attempt to fill this knowledge gap by reviewing and compiling the existing scientific literature on methods, including ground-based measurements (e.g. gauging stations, wireless sensor network) and remote sensing observations (e.g. from topographic LiDAR, multispectral and radar sensors) that have been used and/or can be relevant to monitor the performance of NBS against five HMRs: floods, droughts, heatwaves, landslides, and storm surges and coastal erosion. These can allow the mapping of the risks and impacts of the specific hydro-meteorological events. We found that the selection and application of monitoring methods mostly rely on the particular NBS being monitored, resource availability (e.g. time, budget, space) and type of HMRs. No standalone method currently exists that can allow monitoring the performance of NBS in its broadest view. However, equipments, tools and technologies developed for other purposes, such as for ground-based measurements and atmospheric observations, can be applied to accurately monitor the performance of NBS to mitigate HMRs. We also focused on the capabilities of passive and active remote sensing, pointing out their associated opportunities and difficulties for NBS monitoring application. We conclude that the advancement in airborne and satellite-based remote sensing technology has signified a leap in the systematic monitoring of NBS performance, as well as provided a robust way for the spatial and	key performance indicators; nbs monitoring; in-situ measurement; remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ensuring access to a healthy, affordable, and sustainable diet is one of the greatest challenges facing many low- and middle-income countries such as South Africa. These challenges in accessing a diverse diet often persist despite biocultural richness. For example, South Africa is globally recognised for its rich biodiversity, an ecologically unrivalled coastline, and a rich body of traditional knowledge amongst wild-food users. In this paper, we explore the potential that coastal wild foods as neglected and underutilised species (NUS) can play in local food systems in South Africa's Western Cape Province. Following a previously established transformation lab (T-Lab) method, here we report the observations and outcomes emerging from a two-day workshop held in May 2019 with a group of 40 actors involved in the local food system in diverse ways. Farmers, small-scale fishers, indigenous knowledge holders, representatives from non-profit organisations, chefs, bartenders, academics, activists, conservationists, and government officials were brought together with the aim of strengthening an emerging coalition of coastal wild food actors. Findings highlighted the existence of a fledgling economy for coastal wild foods, driven by high-end chefs. The T-Lab was essentially a tool of knowledge co-production around food system transformation and helped to surface deeply embedded issues on land, race, history, and culture that warrant engagement if a better food system is to emerge. In a country that is drought prone and vulnerable to climate change, a more resilient and sustainable food system is a necessity. But defining alternative governance systems to shift towards a healthier, more sustainable, and more equitable food system will require concerted effort across all stakeholders.	fynbos; healthy diets; neglected and underutilised species; south africa; sustainability transformations; t-labs; coastal wild foods	NA	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760400	42833	2015.2374	Biofixation of a high-concentration of carbon dioxide using a deep-sea bacterium: Sulfurovum lithotrophicum 42BKT(T)	Concerns about global warming have dramatically increased interest in the development of a strategy for the sustainable and economical fixation of carbon dioxide (CO2). Achieving treatment of high-concentration CO2 (e.g., higher than 1 atm CO2) with a minute thermal energy penalty (e.g., at room temperature) is a significant goal for efficient fixation. Herein, we report the great potential of Sulfurovum lithotrophicum 42BKT(T), a deep-sea sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, for the biofixation of CO2 at a pressure as high as 2 atm CO2, mixed with 8 atm N-2, at 29 degrees C. Sulfurovum lithotrophicum 42BKT(T) exhibited a fast specific fixation rate of approximately 0.42 g CO2 g per cell per h. Moreover, 37\% of the total CO2 fixation was present in the form of five dominant metabolites, especially glutamate and pyroglutamate. This work constitutes an efficient biofixation strategy of high-concentration CO2 by using a deep-sea chemolithoautotrophic bacterium.

Engaging and assessing diverse stakeholders' values and integrating those with evidence-based knowledge is critical for timely, effective and transparent preservation and climate adaptation of coastal cultural heritage. This study assessed technical experts' and community groups' opinions about the importance of value-based prioritization considerations to provide more immediate guidance adaptation planning and decision making. The findings from four separate elicitation surveys demonstrated substantial consistency in value-based climate adaptation prioritization preferences for one type of vulnerable cultural heritage: historic buildings in coastal zones in the United States. In particular, the samples of cultural heritage professionals and members of community groups consistently rated spatial importance, uniqueness, and scientific value of historic buildings as very important considerations for climate adaptation prioritization decision-making. Also, consistently evaluated but of relatively low importance were considerations related to the cost of preservation and adaptation treatments, including previous investments. Few statistically significant differences were found among our samples in their perceptions of importance. These findings provide initial guidance to cultural heritage managers, particularly those with scarce financial resources to allocate for adapting coastal historic buildings, and demonstrate the need for continued development of approaches that provide rapid assessment of coastal heritage stakeholders' adaptation priorities.	climate change; decision-making; prioritization; values; cultural heritage management	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760407	600	2019.59	Coastal adaptation, government-subsidized insurance, and perverse incentives to stay	The law should be a critical tool in promoting and directing climate change adaptation in the USA. This should be particularly true in the nation's extensive coastal zone, much of which is subject to increasing rates of sea level rise, coastal erosion, increasing numbers of increasingly powerful storms, and saltwater intrusion. However, significant coastal infrastructure hampers many coastal adaptation strategies by making retreat both expensive and politically unpalatable. This article examines the specific role of insurance and other financing programs in coastal adaptation strategies. Insurance operates primarily to mitigate risk. The article focuses specifically on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is now driven by coastal catastrophes and is close to bankruptcy; Florida's decision to provide state-financed insurance to coastal property owners in the wake of the 2004-2005 hurricane season; and, conversely, the decisions of other states to use state and federal financing instead to facilitate coastal adaptation, including buyouts of transitioning coastal properties.	coastal adaptation; coastal retreat; insurance; perverse incentives; buyouts; hurricane; flood	2019	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91760415	6564	2016.508	Assessing and reducing vulnerability to climate change: Moving from theory to practical decision-support	As climate change continues to impact socio-ecological systems, tools that assist conservation managers to understand vulnerability and target adaptations are essential. Quantitative assessments of vulnerability are rare because available frameworks are complex and lack guidance for dealing with data limitations and integrating across scales and disciplines. This paper describes a semi-quantitative method for assessing vulnerability to climate change that integrates socio-ecological factors to address management objectives and support decision making. The method applies a framework first adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and uses a structured 10-step process. The scores for each framework element are normalized and multiplied to produce a vulnerability score and then the assessed components are ranked from high to low vulnerability. Sensitivity analyses determine which indicators most influence the analysis and the resultant decision-making process so data quality for these indicators can be reviewed to increase robustness. Prioritisation of components for conservation considers other economic, social and cultural values with vulnerability rankings to target actions that reduce vulnerability to climate change by decreasing exposure or sensitivity and/or increasing adaptive capacity. This framework provides practical decision-support and has been applied to marine ecosystems and fisheries, with two case applications provided as examples: (1) food security in Pacific Island nations under climate-driven fish declines, and (2) fisheries in the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia. The step-wise process outlined here is broadly applicable and can be undertaken with minimal resources using existing data, thereby having great potential to inform adaptive natural resource management in diverse locations.	climate vulnerability; assessment framework; climate adaptation; socio-ecological systems; decision support	2016	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760416	7028	2020.853	Assessing drivers of tropical and subtropical marine fish collapses of Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone	Overfishing is a concerning threat that can lead to the collapse of fish stocks. We assessed the combinations of factors, including biological traits, types of exploitation and responses to sea temperature and salinity changes, that drive species to collapse in the Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) tropical and subtropical regions. We applied a catch-based method of stock classification and a catch time series of 61 years from 132 exploited fish species. Species were categorized as Collapsed, Overexploited, Fully Exploited or in Development, and we used a GAM analysis to understand their categorization over time. Furthermore, a Redundancy Analysis was developed to assess the species characteristics that best predicted each exploitation category. Twelve species were classified as Collapsed, 55 as Overexploited, 46 as Fully Exploited and 19 as in Development. Tropical and subtropical exploited species collapses in Brazil were best explained by a complex combination of a negative impact of warmer sea temperatures, fishery exploitation and specific life-history traits. A synergistic interaction between these factors could bring species to collapse. We hypothesize that the exploitation of species with vulnerable traits may alter how these species respond to temperature and, therefore, lead them to collapse given that intense exploitation may affect their ability to respond to temperature increases. Measures to mitigate climate change impacts should take into consideration incentives to decrease the exploitation of vulnerable species and, specifically, consider species with more sensitive biological traits. Such measures are also important to minimize the socioeconomic impacts on the people that depend on these species. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

91760424	13344	2018.1324	Climate Change Mitigation: from Carbon Cycle to Policy	Climate change can be mitigated simultaneously by two ways, maintaining the greenhouse gases below the carbon budget and conserving marine and terrestrial vegetation for carbon sequestration. Marine vegetation (e.g. mangrove and seagrass meadows) is less than 0.5\% of the total marine area and narrower compared to terrestrial vegetation. However, marine vegetation has high net primary production (NPP) and contributes more than 50\% of the global carbon burial in its substrate and biomass. Indonesia has 3,301,848 ha of mangrove area, the widest in South-East Asia. The seagrass meadows of Indonesia are 150,693 ha, the second widest seagrass area in the world. These two ecosystems are important for the global carbon cycle due to their high capacity for carbon sequestration. Considering this potential, it is necessary to promote a strategic scientific-based policy of conservation of marine vegetation areas for both local and national stakeholders. The policies consist of: 1) to implement the National/Local Action Plan for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions (RAN/D GRK); 2) to manage the land use changes that contribute 67\% of total national emissions; 3) to determine coastal ecosystem protection areas that are considering the province policy in the Plan for Zoning of Coastal Areas and Small Islands (RZWP3K); 4) to rehabilitate terrestrial vegetation, coastal ecosystems, and aquatic conservation areas (President Regulation no 61/2011); and 5) to strictly carry out the national policy for green open space (Government Regulation no 26/2008).	carbon cycle; climate change; coastal; ecosystems; policy; terrestrial	2018	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0
91760426	262228	2016.539	Carbon storage in a restored mangrove forest in Can Gio Mangrove Forest Park, Mekong Delta, Vietnam	Mangrove forests are considered to be the most important carbon (C) sink in the tropics. Evaluation of ecosystem C storage in restored mangrove forests will provide important information for management and conservation practices, climate change mitigation strategies and reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) schemes. Despite this, a gap remains in the understanding of ecosystem C storage in Can Gio Mangrove Forest Park (CGM), the largest restored mangrove forest area in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. In the present study, ecosystem C storage was quantified in CGM in growing mangrove forests, a typhoon disturbed forest, and a mudflat by measuring the biomass of trees, roots, downed woody debris, sediment organic C, and overall depth. The mean above-ground C storage was 102Â Â±Â 24.7, 298.1Â Â±Â 14.1 and 243.6Â Â±Â 40.4Â MgCÂ haâˆ’1 for fringe, transition, and interior forests, respectively. The high above- and below-ground C stocks resulted in high ecosystem C storage, ranging from 765 to 1026Â MgCÂ haâˆ’1, with an overall mean of 910.7Â Â±Â 32.3Â MgCÂ haâˆ’1. The ecosystem C storage of the typhoon disturbed forest and mudflat was less than that of mangrove forests, with values of 573.5Â MgCÂ haâˆ’1 and 619.8Â Â±Â 24.3Â MgCÂ haâˆ’1, respectively. At the regional scale, CGM can store up to 41.5Â TgÂ C, which is equivalent to 152.3Â Tg of CO2e. The results of the present study suggest that mangrove restoration and conservation are effective tools for enhancing C storage and offsetting C emissions at both regional and national scales.

91760431	253559	2019.3808	Carbon dioxide fluxes of temperate urban wetlands with different restoration history	Carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of tidal brackish wetlands and how they may be affected by restoration methods are largely unknown. The New Jersey Meadowlands, a tidal brackish estuary system, have had a long history of pollution, hydrological alterations, multiple restoration and mitigation treatments since the early 1970ies. To understand the effects of restoration, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was measured with the eddy covariance technique in three urban tidal brackish wetland sites over three years: an organic matter amended restored site, a non-amended restored site and a natural (non-restored) wetland site. Our results showed all three sites to be a CO2 source in the wintertime reverting to a weak sink of CO2 in the summer and annually to be sources of CO2 for some of the sites for some of the time. However, the amended restored wetland was found to have the highest release of CO2. Annual destructive harvest of the major species at these wetlands (Spartina ssp and Phragmites australis) did not show significant differences in the aboveground net primary productivity and leaf area over the course of this study. Overall, aboveground biomass production of the three wetlands sites was within the expected range of tidal brackish marshes, but the sites differed in their NEE, ecosystem respiration, and gross ecosystem production. This investigation suggests that CO2 uptake and potential subsequent carbon sequestration may be strongly affected by the management and restoration history of the wetlands, and in our case these wetlands are often acting as a source of CO2, and not as a sink, as may have been expected.

It is a noteworthy example of implementation of an innovation in long-term strategic delta planning. The Dutch Delta Program was central herein. Pursuing its ambition to make the Netherlands climate-proof, the Delta Program invited a diverse set of actors to participate in developing a long-term adaptation plan, and also to propose innovative short-term measures to help realize that plan. The wide green dike was actively promoted by a local water board, with involvement of scientists and nature conservation organizations. A stepwise participatory process resulted in national-level recognition of the potential of the wide green dike, particularly due to its ``green{''} and ``adaptability{''} characteristics. Alignment of flood protection and climate adaptation goals with nature conservation objectives, as well as collaboration with new actors, were all crucial in the reintroduction of this innovation.	dutch delta program; long-term adaptation strategy; innovation; new actor coalitions	2019	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760435	264540	2015.2638	A preliminary assessment of carbon storage suitability in deep underground geological formations of New Brunswick, Canada	An assessment of the surface and subsurface geology in New Brunswick has identified several regions, close to Large Final Emitters (industrial sites releasing carbon dioxide, CO2, into the atmosphere), underlain by large volumes of various sedimentary rocks that could act as either the reservoir or seal in a carbon storage operation. There is a lack of subsurface data with which to make an assessment for the New Brunswick Platform, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and Northumberland Strait. In the Moncton Basin, the McCully Gas Field is hosted in tight gas sands where it would be difficult to pump down CO2 at an economical rate. The Stoney Creek Oil and Gas Field south of Moncton is not at sufficient depth for CO2 to be in a supercritical state, necessary for compressed storage. Saline reservoirs could underlie suitably large areas around these fields, but again there is limited information on the quality of the potential reservoir rock. In the Bay of Fundy, south of Saint John, one borehole indicates a prospective location that includes a saline reservoir with suitable thickness and wireline-calculated porosity and permeability, a seal with suitable thickness, and limited faulting to potentially compartmentalize the reservoir or, conversely, compromise the continuity of the seal. The major uncertainty is trap volume, which is particularly difficult to assess based on the borehole being the only data point within a 50 km radius. This is also an environmentally sensitive offshore area. Until data deficiencies are addressed, no locations can be recommended for carbon storage.

91760443	6944	2022.968	The potential impact of fishing in peruvian marine protected areas (MPAs) on artisanal fishery poverty during El Nino events	In Peru, the fishing sector, particularly artisanal fishing, is one of the most impacted by El Nin similar to o phenomenon. One possible adaptation strategy to mitigate the negative economic effects of El Nin similar to o is the development of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This study measures the effect on poverty of artisanal fishers of being able to fish in Peruvian MPAs in the face of the El Nin similar to o. Therefore, using propensity score matching, we estimated the effect of the El Nin similar to o 2015 event on the income of fishers by comparing the poverty levels of fishers with and without access to the MPAs. The study estimated no significant effect of the MPAs on probability of poverty reduction in two out of three MPAs but a 29\% (17\%;42\%) was detected at one MPA. The results indicate that fishing in Peruvian MPAs could reduce the vulnerability of artisanal fishers to El Nin similar to o. Additionally, this study concludes that the estimated impact in reducing the effects of El Nin similar to o on the poverty depends largely on the participation of fishers in its management and highlights the importance of taking a transdisciplinary and cross sector approach to MPA design and management to ensure the potential benefits of MPAs can be realised.	el nin?o-southern oscillation peruvian artisanal fisheries marine protected areas propensity score matching	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760446	958	2022.138	Climate risk perceptions and perceived yield loss increases agricultural technology adoption in the polder areas of Bangladesh	The effects of climate change are likely to increase the frequency of flood, drought, and salinity events in the coastal areas of Bangladesh, posing many challenges for agrarian communities. Sustainable intensification in the form of improved agricultural management practices and new technologies may help farmers cope with stress and adapt to changing conditions. In this study, we explore how climate change perceptions of agricultural risk affect adaptation to climate change through technology adoption in a unique landscape: the polders of Bangladesh. In 2016, a survey was conducted in 1003 households living on these artificial, leveed islands facing the Bay of Bengal. We analyzed the responses from polder residents to construct a climate risk index which quantifies climate risk perception in this highly vulnerable agrarian landscape. We analyzed how polder demographics influence their perceptions about climatic change using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). Further, by using three bivariate probit regression models, we estimated how the perception of climate risk drives the differential adoption of new agricultural technologies. Our findings show that farmers perceive polder agriculture as highly vulnerable to four environmental change factors: flooding, drought, salinity, and pest infestation. The SUR model suggests that farmer demographics, community group memberships, and access to different inputs and services strongly influence climatic risk perceptions. Findings also suggest that polder farmers with higher risk perceptions have a higher propensity to adopt both chemical and mechanical adaptation strategies. Cost, however, limits the ability of farmers to adopt improved technologies, suggesting an opportunity for institution-led approaches.	sustainable intensification; agricultural risk; climate change impacts; coastal bangladesh; agrarian adaptation	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760449	47275	1999.838	Ocean sequestration of CO2 - An overview	The ocean represents the largest potential sink for anthropogenic CO2, Discharging CO2 directly to the ocean would accelerate the ongoing, but slow, natural processes by which over 90\% of present-day emissions are currently entering the ocean indirectly and would reduce both peak atmospheric CO2 concentrations and their rate of increase. This paper discusses the options for finding ocean sequestration strategies that are environmentally sound, economically viable, and technically feasible. In addition, some current research projects in this area are highlighted.

91760456	5502	2018.571	Comparing the cost effectiveness of nature-based and coastal adaptation: A case study from the Gulf Coast of the United States	Coastal risks are increasing from both development and climate change. Interest is growing in the protective role that coastal nature-based measures (or green infrastructure), such as reefs and wetlands, can play in adapting to these risks. However, a lack of quantitative information on their relative costs and benefits is one principal factor limiting their use more broadly. Here, we apply a quantitative risk assessment framework to assess coastal flood risk (from climate change and economic exposure growth) across the United States Gulf of Mexico coast to compare the cost effectiveness of different adaptation measures. These include nature-based (e.g. oyster reef restoration), structural or grey (e.g., seawalls) and policy measures (e.g. home elevation). We first find that coastal development will be a critical driver of risk, particularly for major disasters, but climate change will cause more recurrent losses through changes in storms and relative sea level rise. By 2030, flooding will cost \$134 +/- 176.6 billion (for different economic growth scenarios), but as the effects of climate change, land subsidence and concentration of assets in the coastal zone increase, annualized risk will more than double by 2050 with respect to 2030. However, from the portfolio we studied, the set of cost-effective adaptation measures (with benefit to cost ratios above 1) could prevent up to \$57 +/- 101 billion in losses, which represents 42.8 +/- 57.2\% of the total risk. Nature-based adaptation options could avert more than \$50 billion of these costs, and do so cost effectively with average benefit to cost ratios above 3.5. Wetland and oyster reef restoration are found to be particularly cost-effective. This study demonstrates that the cost effectiveness of nature-based, grey and policy measures can be compared quantitatively with one another, and that the cost effectiveness of adaptation becomes more attractive as climate change and coastal development intensifies in the future. It also shows that investments in nature-based adaptation could meet multiple objectives for environmental restoration, adaptation and flood risk reduction.

91760461	321	2016.22	Participation, scenarios and pathways in long-term planning for climate change adaptation	This article describes a climate change adaptation planning process triggered by a group of researchers and stakeholders in a context where no collective responses or long-term plans for protecting a vulnerable coastal system had been initiated, despite local perceptions of vulnerability and risk. The case study shows the application of two methods: scenario workshops and adaptation pathways in the context of a participatory action research methodological design. Participatory action research and qualitative scenario methods are highlighted as accelerators of climate change adaptation processes by calling to action, facilitating and connecting diverse social groups with a stake in a long-term plan towards a more adapted society. The experience leads to the conclusion that planning climate change adaptation has to go far beyond the technical dimension and take into account those affected (in the present and the future) by decisions made. A holistic approach to climate change adaptation planning will depend on the interrelations of managerial and top-down approaches with localized initiatives driven through an inclusive and collective action research process.	climate change adaptation; long-term; scenario workshop; adaptation pathways; participation	2016	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91760462	253245	2019.4658	Lessons from the ROAD project for future deployment of CCS	The ROAD project was designed to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of a large-scale, integrated CCS-chain deployed on power generation. Post-combustion technology was to be applied to separate CO2 from the flue gases of the new 1069 MWe coal-fired Maasvlakte Power Plant 3 (MPP3) in the harbour area of Rotterdam. From the capture unit, the CO2 was to be compressed and transported through a pipeline, originally to the P18-A platform in the North Sea to inject CO2 in the P18-4 gas reservoir. An alternative storage site, the nearshore Q16-Maas, was selected in 2015. Feasibility and FEED studies were performed in the period from 2010 to 2017, when the industrial partners pulled out of the project because of lack of political and financial support for the ROAD project. Capture, transport and storage technology is available and will work; remaining questions can be answered by engineering solutions. The full-scale capture plant can be designed and procured to the standard required to enable FID. Pilot plants have proved very valuable for testing and improving the ROAD capture plant design. In all cases, safe and practical designs to transport and store the CO2 were developed.

91760463	253312	2019.3804	Subtropical mangrove wetland is a stronger carbon dioxide sink in the dry than wet seasons	Coastal mangrove wetlands have an excellent potential in sequestrating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) owing to their high primary productivity as well as slow anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. Yet, there is hitherto a paucity of researches examining the temporal variations and environmental controls of ecosystem-scale CO2 fluxes in subtropical mangroves using quasi-continuous, high temporal resolution measurements. In this study, we measured the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) between the atmosphere and a subtropical estuarine mangrove dominated by Kandelia obovata using an eddy covariance system for two full years to investigate the seasonal variability and key biophysical drivers of NEE. During the wet seasons, the magnitude of increase in ecosystem respiration (Re) was greater than that in gross primary productivity (GPP) owing to a combination of higher temperature and lower percentage of inundation, tidal height and water salinity, which subsequently resulted in an overall decrease in net CO2 uptake as compared to the dry seasons. Our results of path analysis showed that temperature was a dominant control of the temporal variations in CO2 flux during the wet seasons, while its influence became weaker during the dry seasons. On the other hand, an increase in water salinity during the dry seasons had a positive influence on GPP, which was likely related to a greater availability of ions (mainly Clâˆ’ and Na+) in supporting photosynthesis by mangrove trees in this coastal wetland with relatively low salinity (âˆ¼5â€“15 ppt). Our subtropical mangrove wetland was shown to be a significant carbon (C) sink, with annual C uptake rates of 890 and 758 g CO2-C m-2 yrâˆ’1 in the two years of study. We found a strong control of mangrove CO2 fluxes by biophysical factors such as temperature and salinity, implying that global warming and a reduction in water salinity in response to a greater river discharge could potentially reduce the C sink strength of estuarine mangroves in the subtropical regions.

91760464	10716	2015.745	Impact of CO2 leakage from sub-seabed carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) resevoirs on benthic virus-prokaryote interactions and functions	Atmospheric CO2 emissions are a global concern due to their predicted impact on biodiversity, ecosystems functioning, and human life. Among the proposed mitigation strategies, CO2 capture and storage, primarily the injection of CO2 into marine deep geological formations has been suggested as a technically practical option for reducing emissions. However, concerns have been raised that possible leakage from such storage sites, and the associated elevated levels of pCO(2) could locally impact the biodiversity and biogeochemical processes in the sediments above these reservoirs. Whilst a number of impact assessment studies have been conducted, no information is available on the specific responses of viruses and virushost interactions. In the present study, we tested the impact of a simulated CO2 leakage on the benthic microbial assemblages, with specific focus on microbial activity and virus-induced prokaryotic mortality (VIPM). We found that exposure to levels of CO2 in the overlying seawater from 1,000 to 20,000 ppm for a period up to 140 days, resulted in a marked decrease in heterotrophic carbon production and organic matter degradation rates in the sediments, associated with lower rates of VIPM, and a progressive accumulation of sedimentary organic matter with increasing CO2 concentrations. These results suggest that the increase in seawater pCO(2) levels that may result from CO2 leakage, can severely reduce the rates of microbial-mediated recycling of the sedimentary organic matter and viral infections, with major consequences on C cycling and nutrient regeneration, and hence on the functioning of benthic ecosystems.	viral infection; benthic prokaryotes; biogeochemical cycles; climate change; heterotrophic carbon production; enzymatic activity	2015	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760466	21941	2020.2371	Artificial Structures Steer Morphological Development of Salt Marshes: A Model Study	Salt marshes are increasingly recognized as resilient and sustainable supplements to traditional engineering structures for protecting coasts against flooding. Nevertheless, many salt marshes face severe erosion. There is a consensus that providing structures that create sheltered conditions from high energetic conditions can improve the potential for salt marsh growth. However, little proof is provided on the explicit influence of structures to promote salt marsh growth. This paper investigates how artificial structures can be used to steer the morphological development of salt marshes. A morphological model (Delft3D Flexible Mesh) was applied, which enabled the analysis of various artificial structures with realistic representation. A salt marsh in the Wadden Sea which has seen heavy erosion (lateral retreat rate of 0.9 m/year) served as case study. We simulate both daily and storm conditions. Hereby, vegetation is represented by an increased bed roughness. The model is able to simulate the governing processes of salt marsh development. Results show that, without artificial structures, erosion of the salt marsh and tidal flat continues. With structures implemented, results indicate that there is potential for salt marsh growth in the study area. Moreover, traditional structures, which were widely implemented in the past, proved to be most effective to stimulate marsh growth. More broadly, the paper indicates how morphological development of a salt marsh can be steered by various configurations of artificial structures.	salt marsh; wadden sea; nature-based coastal protection; artificial structures; coastal resilience; numerical modeling; process-based	2020	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91760469	57895	2021.5688	Massive loss of aboveground biomass and its effect on sediment organic carbon concentration: Less mangrove, more carbon?	Mangroves play an important role in the nutrient cycle of coastal areas, contributing to the health of adjacent ecosystems by retaining carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous. Different studies have shown that sediment organic carbon (SOC) stock decrease with the loss of above-ground forest biomass. Our objective was to assess the effect of deforestation on the ability of mangroves to store carbon and retain nutrients in the sediment. We hypothesized that conserved forests contain the highest values of SOC compared to sites where the vegetal cover was completely lost. The sampling was carried out in a highly altered ecosystem in the South Caribbean, where a freshwater diversion project had been implemented between 1993 and 1998 to rehabilitate 290 km(2) of a deforested mangrove area after hypersalination of the sediment. Based on our results, we reject our initial hypothesis; SOC stores in areas where massive mangrove mortality occurred were between 258 +/- 2 and 339 +/- 19 Mg C ha(-1), i.e., two times higher than those in conserved mangrove forest areas (156 +/- 16 Mg C ha(-1)). Nitrogen (N) followed a trend similar to that of SOC, in which sites with degraded mangroves had greater N stores (between 15.5 +/- 0.4 and 19.1 +/- 1.0 Mg N ha(-1)) than conserved site (11.7 +/- 0.8 Mg N ha(-1)). In contrast, phosphorus (P) presented higher values at the conserved site (3.2 +/- 0.3 Mg P ha(-1)) than at degraded sites (between 0.8 +/- 0.2 and 2.0 +/- 0.2 Mg P ha(-1)). The higher concentration of SOC in highly degraded sites may be driven by the balance between the large accumulation of dead plant material due to hypersalination and the low decay rates due to anoxia sediment conditions.	degraded mangroves; blue carbon; soil organic carbon; colombian caribbean mangrove	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760473	17451	2017.1362	Formation Behaviors of CO2 Hydrate in Kaoline and Bentonite Clays with Partially Water Saturated	CO2 hydrates can be used for long term storage of CO2 in the deep ocean. Clay minerals are the most important components of the marine sediments. In this study, the formation behaviors of carbon dioxide hydrate in kaoline clay and bentonite clay with partially water saturated were studied in a closed system. The mass ratio of water to Kaoline and Bentonite clays is 20\%. The experiments were carried out at the temperature of 279.15 K and the initial formation pressure range of 4.8-3.4 MPa. The liquefaction of the carbon dioxide was observed in the cooling process by setting the temperature of the water bath to the valued experimental temperature. The temperature in the crystallizer begins to rise quickly when the hydrate starts to form and then decreases gradually after reaching the highest value. For the experiments in kaoline clay, the temperature decreases gradually along with the equilibrium hydrate formation temperature, and the hydrate formation rate is controlled by the heat transfer process. The final conversion of the water to hydrate increases with the increase of the initial formation pressure and restrained by the equilibrium hydrate formation pressure. For the experiments in bentonite clay, the temperature during the hydrate formation is much higher than the equilibrium temperature for CO2 hydrate formation. The final pressure is much higher than the equilibrium pressure of CO2 hydrate, and increases with the increase of the initial formation pressure, indicating that the equilibrium pressure CO2 hydrate in bentonite clay is higher than the bulk CO2 hydrate.

91760923	7514	2021.971	Citizen science for monitoring seasonal-scale beach erosion and behaviour with aerial drones	Sandy beaches are highly dynamic systems which provide natural protection from the impact of waves to coastal communities. With coastal erosion hazards predicted to increase globally, data to inform decision making on erosion mitigation and adaptation strategies is becoming critical. However, multi-temporal topographic data over wide geographical areas is expensive and time consuming and often requires highly trained professionals. In this study we demonstrate a novel approach combining citizen science with low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles that reliably produces survey-grade morphological data able to model sediment dynamics from event to annual scales. The high-energy wave-dominated coast of south-eastern Australia, in Victoria, is used as a field laboratory to test the reliability of our protocol and develop a set of indices to study multi-scale erosional dynamics. We found that citizen scientists provide unbiased data as accurate as professional researchers. We then observed that open-ocean beaches mobilise three times as much sediment as embayed beaches and distinguished between slowed and accelerated erosional modes. The data was also able to assess the efficiency of sand nourishment for shore protection. Our citizen science protocol provides high quality monitoring capabilities, which although subject to important legislative preconditions, it is applicable in other parts of the world and transferable to other landscape systems where the understanding of sediment dynamics is critical for management of natural or anthropogenic processes.

91760980	301733	2020.2564	Exergoeconomic and air emission analyses for marine refrigeration with waste heat recovery system: a case study	Nowadays, shipping industry faces challenges of energy efficiency and reducing of fuel consumption. Moreover, Waste Heat Recovery Systems (WHRS) regarding energy efficiency have a larger focus to utilise the heat energy lost from all thermal processes from ship engines. WHRS is one of the best methods to reduce fuel consumption and implicitly emissions. Refrigeration system, which can be evaluated as one of these systems, has a high energy efficiency potential on ships. In this study, exergoeconomic and air emission analyses of a case study ship named M/V Ince Ilgaz have been performed by comparing Vapour Compression Refrigeration System (VCRS) and VCRS with WHRS on exergy destruction and Second Law Efficiency in case of variable sea water temperature with 15 different refrigerants. Furthermore, a novel proposed WHRS is used for preheating of an accommodation water which leads reducing of exergy destruction about 9.31â€“10.60% while using R134A refrigerant. The fuel consumption due to refrigerant compressor has a 36% increase with the 10Â°C increment of sea water temperature. The increase of CO2, SO2, NO x and Particular Matter (PM) emissions is found about 183.40, 3.10, 4.65 and 0.47 tonnes, by the increase of sea water temperature from 20Â°C to 30Â°C for the fleet of 15 ships, respectively. In conclusion, using waste heat recovery on refrigeration system could directly reduce fuel consumption and air emissions.

91760981	7250	2023.151	The race for space: Modelling the landward migration of coastal wetlands under sea level rise at regional scale	Globally, sea-level rise (SLR) is a major environmental challenge for coastal ecosystems. Of particular concern are the impacts on intertidal wetlands, the loss of which would have detrimental consequences for both human and ecological communities. On the south-east Australian coast, case studies suggest that the future of intertidal wetlands will greatly depend on landward migration as surface accretion may not keep up with the predicted SLR in many estuaries. However, due to differences in geomorphological settings and land-use, estuaries vary in their capacity to accommodate lateral migration. Regional scale assessment of the lateral accommodation space is therefore critical for pre-emptive planning to conserve these valuable coastal ecosystems. In this study, we analysed wetland lateral accommodation space distribution within 110 estuaries under three SLR scenarios and three land management options on the New South Wales coast, south-east Australia. From the wetland distribution predictions, we calculated and mapped the lateral accommodation space in each estuary associated with each sea level and land use scenario. We further investigated the relationships between wetland migration capacity, intertidal hypsometry represented by elevation skewness, and estuary type within a Bayesian analysis framework. Our results showed that while a few large riverine estuaries dominated the state's total accommodation space, saline wetlands were at risk of disappearing from most intermittently closed-open estuaries if they cannot vertically accrete at the pace of SLR. These distinct responses to SLR are due to different elevation distributions. Furthermore, our assessment of land use adaptation options suggested that the promotion of landward migration without impairing other important ecosystems could be achieved by making low intensity land uses available within several riverine estuaries and barrier (open entrance) estuaries. Through identifying migration opportunities and barriers, the findings of the study could support regional scale adaptation strategies to ensure the sustainability of wetland-associated ecosystem goods and services.	intertidal wetland migration; bayesian model; elevation skewness; mangroves; saltmarshes; sea level rise	2023	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760989	12049	2009.360	Understanding and Managing Human Threats to the Coastal Marine Environment	Coastal marine habitats at the interface of land and sea are subject to threats from human activities in both realms. Researchers have attempted to quantify how these various threats impact different coastal ecosystems, and more recently have focused on understanding the cumulative impact from multiple threats. Here, the top threats to coastal marine ecosystems and recent efforts to understand their relative importance, ecosystem-level impacts, cumulative effects, and how they can best be managed and mitigated, are briefly reviewed. Results of threat analysis and rankings will differ depending on the conservation target (e.g., vulnerable species, pristine ecosystems, mitigatable threats), scale of interest (local, regional, or global), whether externalities are considered, and the types of management tools available (e.g., marine-protected areas versus ecosystem-based management). Considering the cumulative effect of multiple threats has only just begun and depends on spatial analysis to predict overlapping threats and a better understanding of multiple-stressor effects and interactions. Emerging conservation practices that hold substantial promise for protecting coastal marine systems include multisector approaches, such as ecosystem-based management (EBM), that account for ecosystem service valuation; comprehensive spatial management, such as ocean zoning; and regulatory mechanisms that encourage or require cross-sector goal setting and evaluation. In all cases, these efforts require a combination of public and private initiatives for success. The state of our ecological understanding, public awareness, and policy initiatives make the time ripe for advancing coastal marine management and improving our stewardship of coastal and marine ecosystems.	marine conservation; cumulative impacts; ecological threat analysis; ecosystem-based management; ecosystem services; coastal conservation; multiple stressors	2009	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

A component in designing the monitoring program will be to predict the varying signal caused by an event, here detection of a gas seep through the seafloor from an unknown location. The Bergen Ocean Model (BOM) is used to simulate dispersion of CO2 leaking from different locations in the North Sea, focusing on temporal and spatial variability of the CO2 concentration. It is shown that the statistical footprint depends on seep location and that this will have to be accounted for in designing a network of sensors with highest probability of detecting a seep. As a consequence, heterogeneous probabilistic predictions of CO2 footprints should be available to subsea geological CO2 storage projects in order to meet regulations.	monitoring varying marine environment	2016	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91760996	26	2020.6	Hard or soft flood adaptation? Advantages of a hybrid strategy for Shanghai	Flood risk is expected to increase in coastal cities, particularly in Asian megacities such as Shanghai. This paper presents an integrated modeling framework to simulate changes in the flood risk in Shanghai and provide a cost-benefit analysis of multiple adaptation strategies used to reduce risk. The results show that the potential flood risk will increase dramatically as a result of sea level rise, land subsidence, and socioeconomic development. By 2100, the expected annual damage could reach 0.8\% (uncertainty range: 0.4\%-1.4\%) of local GDP under an optimistic emission scenario (RCP4.5), compared to the current value of 0.03\%. All of the adaptation strategies can effectively reduce the flood risk under the current conditions and those in 2050. In contrast to the `hard' flood protection strategies (i.e., storm-surge barriers and floodwalls), the `soft' strategies (i.e., building codes and nature-based measures) cannot substantially reduce the flood risk in 2100. However, the soft strategies can play a critical role in reducing the residual risk resulting from the hard strategies. A `hybrid' strategy combining a storm-surge barrier, wet-proofing, and coastal wetland development outperforms both hard and soft strategies in terms of low residual risk and high benefit/cost ratio. Additionally, the hybrid strategy can also enable a larger reduction in casualties. These findings imply that managing flood risk is more than the use of single adaptation measures. The methodology developed in this paper can enlighten Shanghai and other coastal cities on an economically and socially feasible adaptation strategy in an uncertain future.	climate change; nonstationarity; coastal flood; risk management; cost-benefit analysis	2020	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Case study: Bottom-trawl fishing vessel powered with medium speed diesel engine	The high-fuel dependency of the shipping industry and its corresponding pollutant emissions need to be addressed within the new de-carbonisation era. Concurrently, the waste-to-energy concept arises to drive sustainable initiatives for energy production. In that sense, in the present study, the feasibility of an alternative fuel oil (AFO) based on recycled-waste lubricating oil was assessed. Tests were conducted on board a bottom-trawler fishing vessel, under real operating conditions. The fishing activity was monitored, and the engine performance, the combustion and injection properties, and the emissions characteristics were studied. The vessel performance when operating on the AFO was compared with that when operating on standard distillate diesel oil (DFO). The results showed that the AFO required preheating up to 70 Â°C owing to its higher viscosity value, which is considerably higher than the allowed by the ISO 8217 standard for distillate fuels. Therefore, a heating module was installed on board the vessel to ensure optimal performance with the AFO. The fuel consumption was slightly lower for the AFO; however, owing to its higher low-heating value, the engine efficiency was higher when using the DFO. The AFO presented lower combustion pressure than the DFO and a longer combustion period; however, its ignition process occurred earlier. The results suggested that the AFO contained light components which caused the early ignition of the fuel, as well as heavy components, which delayed the end of the combustion. The NOX emissions were considerably reduced with the AFO by 15%; the CO2 emissions were slightly reduced as well; however, CO emissions were higher for the AFO by 15%. By operating under the usual conditions while burning the AFO throughout a year, the vessel would consume 8 t of fuel less, and would emit 21 t of greenhouse gases less. The vessel burnt a total of 40,000 L of AFO, for approximately 300 h, without any operational issue. The results demonstrate that the distillate fuel obtained from lubricating oil is suitable for marine medium-speed engines and enables satisfactory performance.

91761010	47501	1992.636	MODELING THE RELEASE OF CO2 IN THE DEEP OCEAN	In order to better understand the mechanics of ocean disposal of CO2 captured from power plants, a comprehensive plume model was developed to simulate the dynamic, near-field behavior Of CO2 released in the water column as either a buoyant liquid or vapor. The key design variables in the model that can be controlled are: (1) release depth, z(o), (2) number of diffuser ports, N, and (3) initial bubble or droplet radius, r(o).  For a CO2 stream from a 500 MW power plant with 100\% capture and z(o)=500 m, N=10, and r(o)=1 cm, the model predicts that the plume will rise less than 100 m. This will result in CO2 enrichment at depths greater than 400 m. Detailed predictions of local CO2 concentrations near the plume are presented and discussed. The issue of the residence time of the captured CO2 in the ocean is also addressed. We estimate a typical residence time of less than 50 years for releases of CO2 less than 500 m deep and, for a release depth of 1000 m, a residence time from 200 to 300 years. These residence times may be increased by releasing in areas of downwelling or by forming solid CO2-hydrates, which can sink to the ocean floor.	carbon dioxide emissions; carbon dioxide storage; fossil-fuel power plants; global warming; greenhouse effect; marine disposal; plume model	1992	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91761014	12656	2009.384	Community involvement in management for maintaining coral reef resilience and biodiversity in southern Caribbean marine protected areas	Climate change is posing new challenges to conservation because management policies on protected coral reefs are less effective than they were before the current ecosystem degradation. Coral reefs, the most diverse and complex marine ecosystem provide economic services for millions, but are seriously threatened worldwide because reef-building corals are experiencing bleaching phenomena and a steady decline in abundance. The resources of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Cartagena, Colombia, are in constant decline, despite a current management plan and on-site staff, urging new conservation actions. A multidisciplinary team gathered to evaluate management effectiveness including biophysical, socioeconomic and governance indicators. Coral cover and fish diversity and abundance were low both inside and outside the MPA, which suggests a limited efficiency of management. Currently, the MPA is a reef with low coral cover and high algae cover as well as large dead coral areas, which are generally signs of highly degraded reef habitats. Live coral cover in the MPA was represented by pioneer coral species such as Agaricia tenuifolia and Porites astreoides. Nonetheless, 35\% of the scleractinian species sampled in the area harbored more than one zooxanthellae symbiont, which suggests potential resistance and resilience against coral bleaching. Maintenance of trophic structure and functional diversity is an important endeavor that should be a priority for management in order to allow ecosystem resilience. Social and governance indicators showed low-income levels and few opportunities for communities living in and around the park, low governability, weak communication among stakeholders and with authorities at different levels. As a result, problems related to over exploitation of resources were commonplace in the MPA. These results reflect low adaptive capacity of communities to comply with restrictive conservation rules, showing that establishment of a protected area is a necessary but insufficient condition to guarantee conservation goals. Ignoring the role of local communities only will exacerbate the problems associated with natural resources. Involvement of communities in strategic ecosystems management appears to be a requisite to improve effectiveness of protected areas, and participatory strategies, such as co-management, offer opportunities to improve governability while letting communities adapt to MPA needs.	caribbean; colombia; coral reefs; management effectiveness; marine protected areas; zooxanthellae; social-ecological systems; symbiodinium; participatory methods; experimental economic games; community involvement; comanagement	2009	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761018	13543	2021.1849	Determinants of climate change adaptation strategies in the coastal zone of Bangladesh: implications for adaptation to climate change in developing countries	Considering the growing threats of climate change, in addition to mitigation strategies, it is highly and equally critical to understand the socio-economic determinants of climate adaptation in order to develop climate adaptation policies. This study makes a first attempt to explore the determinants of adaptation to climate change and choices of adaptation strategies at a larger spatial scale of the south-west coastal areas in Bangladesh, which is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions in the world. We employ both qualitative and quantitative approaches in order to examine farmers' perception of climate risks, determinants and choices of adaptation strategies to climate change in six coastal districts of Bangladesh. Farmers are adapting to these situations using their knowledge and experience. The study reveals that a number of adaptation strategies have been taken to reduce the negative impacts of climate change. These adaptation strategies are categorized into four groups: crop management, water management, land management, and income diversification. Availability of inputs, high production cost, agricultural extension service, and proper adaptation knowledge and experiences were noted as the main non-climatic challenges, as well as different climatic factors in agricultural adaptation strategies. Statistical analysis indicates that the different socio-economic determinants of farmers significantly influence their choices of adaptation to climate change. Farmers adopt these adaptations mostly autonomously rather than on the advice of government. This study could be useful for developing national adaptation policies in Bangladesh and other similar developing countries.	socio-economic determinants; adaptation; agriculture; coastal	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761021	7264	2021.938	Good governance and local level policy implementation for disaster-risk-reduction: actual, perceptual and contested perspectives in coastal communities in Bangladesh	Purpose Despite Bangladesh's great strides in formulating disaster management policies following the principles of good governance, the degree to which these policies have successfully been implemented at the local level remains largely unknown. The objectives of this study were two-fold: (1) to examine the roles and effectiveness of local-level governance and disaster management institutions, and (2) to identify barriers to the implementation of national policies and Disaster-Risk-Reduction (DRR) guidelines at the local community level. Design/methodology/approach Between January 2014 and June 2015 we carried out an empirical investigation in two coastal communities in Bangladesh. We employed a qualitative research and Case Study approach, using techniques from the Participatory Rural Appraisal toolbox to collect data from local community members as well as government and NGO officials. Findings Our study revealed that interactive disaster governance, decentralization of disaster management, and compliance by local-level institutions with good governance principles and national policy guidelines can be extremely effective in reducing disaster-loss and damages. According to coastal community members, the local governments have generally failed to uphold good governance principles, and triangulated data confirm that the region at large suffers from rampant corruption, political favoritism, lack of transparency and accountability and minimal inclusion of local inhabitants in decision-making - all of which have severely impeded the successful implementation of national disaster-management policies. Research limitations/implications While considerable research on good governance has been pursued, our understanding of good disaster governance and their criteria is still poor. In addition, although numerous national disaster management policy and good governance initiatives have been taken in Bangladesh, like many other developing countries, the nature and extent of their local level implementation are not well known. This study contributes to these research gaps, with identification of further research agenda in these areas. Practical implications The study focuses on good disaster governance and management issues and practices, their strengths and limitations in the context of cyclone and storm surges along coastal Bangladesh. It offers specific good disaster governance criteria for improving multi-level successful implementation. The paper deals with International Sendai Framework that called for enhancement of local level community resilience to disasters. Thus, it contributes to numerous policy and practice areas relating to good disaster governance. Social implications Good disaster governance would benefit not only from future disaster losses but also from improved prevention and mitigation of natural hazards impact, benefiting society at large. Improvement in knowledge and practice in disaster-risk-reduction through good governance and effective management would ensure local community development and human wellbeing at the national level. Originality/value The failure of local-level government institutions to effectively implement national disaster management and resilience-building policies is largely attributable to a lack of financial and human resources, rampant corruption, a lack of accountability and transparency and the exclusion of local inhabitants from decision-making processes. Our study identified the specific manifestations of these failures in coastal communities in Bangladesh. These results underscore the vital need to address the wide gap between national DRR goals and the on-the-ground realities of policy implementation to successfully enhance the country's resilience to climate change-induced disasters.	disaster governance; good governance; disaster risk reduction; cyclone; resilience; bangladesh	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761028	12705	2021.1727	A Roadmap for the Restoration of Mediterranean Macroalgal Forests	Canopy-forming macroalgae play a crucial role in coastal primary production and nutrient cycling, providing food, shelter, nurseries, and habitat for many vertebrate and invertebrate species. However, macroalgal forests are in decline in various places and natural recovery is almost impossible when populations become locally extinct. Hence, active restoration emerges as the most promising strategy to rebuild disappeared forests. In this regard, significant efforts have been made by several EU institutions to research new restoration tools for shallow and mesophotic reef habitats (e.g., MERCES EU project, AFRIMED, and ROCPOP-life) and effective techniques have subsequently been proposed to promote self-sustaining populations. Recent research indicates that macroalgal forest recovery requires a broad spectrum of measures, ranging from mitigating human impacts to restoring the most degraded populations and habitats, and that the viability of large restoration actions is compromised by ongoing human pressures (e.g., pollution, overgrazing, and climate change). We propose a roadmap for Mediterranean macroalgal restoration to assist researchers and stakeholders in decision-making, considering the most effective methods in terms of cost and cost-effectiveness, and taking background environmental conditions and potential threats into account. Last, the challenges currently faced by the restoration of rocky coastal ecosystems under changing climate conditions are also discussed.</p>	marine restoration; macroalgae; canopy forming seaweed; macroalgae culture; marine conservation; cystoseira; fucalean algae; mediterranean conservation	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This coordination and collaboration are reflected in institutional arrangements associated with a whole-of-government and whole-of-community approach to regional adaptation. This study analyzes the development of an interlocal agreement (ILA), the Hampton Roads Sea Level Rise Preparedness and Resilience Intergovernmental Planning Pilot Project (the Pilot Project), as an example of such an arrangement. This study assesses how factors throughout three phases of ILA development (initiation, implementation, and execution) influence outcomes and effectiveness. Drawing upon participant observation, document analysis, survey of participants, and interviews with key informants this study identifies factors that facilitate effective regional adaptation to SLR (impetus, agreement) and factors that hamper adaptation efforts (funding, ease of delivery), and offers insight into the complexities of institutional collective action to address contentious and challenging issues such as SLR.	institutional collective action; hampton roads; sea level rise; interlocal agreement; whole-of-community; whole-of-government	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761035	259115	2017.1658	Overview of the Activities on Heavy Duty Diesel Engines Waste Heat Recovery with Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) in the Frame of the ECCO-MATE EU FP7 Project	The ECCO-MATE Project is a European Union funded project aimed to develop a synergistic framework for cutting edge research on novel engine technologies for higher energy efficiency and lower emissions. The project partners, Ricardo plc, an engineering consulting company, and the University of Trieste, focus the research attention on waste heat recovery systems, such as Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC), which are gaining increasing interest by engine manufacturers, vehicles and ships fleet operators, because of their potential for further increasing engine efficiency and decreasing fuel consumption. In particular, in the frame of the developed research activity, the 1-D Ricardo engine simulation software WAVE has been used in order to assess novel engine concepts, both in the commercial vehicles and marine sectors. A combined engine-ORC system First and Second Law of Thermodynamics analysis has been proposed in order to study where system inefficiencies are concentrated and propose improvements, with particular focus on commercial vehicle heavy duty diesel engines. A thermo-economic analysis has been also considered. Furthermore, in collaboration with the project partners National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) and Winterthur Gas &amp; Diesel (WinGD), an innovative low pressure Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) configuration for low speed 2-stroke ship propulsion units has also been studied with the aim of reducing NOx in order to meet IMO Tier III emissions limits. ORC systems are, in this application also, a promising technology that can be used, in synergy with emission reduction systems, to recover, in particular, low temperature heat sources such as engine coolant and scavenging air, always with the aim of improving overall system efficiency while respecting new stringent emission reduction targets. The first results of the research activity show that a fuel consumption improvement up to 10% could be achieved both for commercial vehicles off-highway applications and in the marine sector, depending on the type of ORC and waste heat recovery architecture chosen and the engine considered.

91761046	299834	2021.1783	The cost-effectiveness of CO2 mitigation measures for the decarbonisation of shipping. The case study of a globally operating ship-management company	The International Maritime Organisation has set a goal to achieve a 50% reduction of the total annual greenhouse gas emissions related to the international shipping by 2050 compared to the 2008 baseline emissions. Thus, companies are looking for solutions and measures to align with the Organisation's goal. Marginal Abatement Cost Curves have been extensively used in the literature to rank several Greenhouse Gas mitigation measures based on their costs of reducing an additional unit of pollution. In this paper an expert-based, bottom-up approach was employed to construct Marginal Abatement Cost Curves for a globally operating ship-management company. Several mitigation measures were examined for the following vessel categories (a) Containerships 8000+ TEU, (b) Containerships 2000â€“2999 TEU, (c) Bulkers 35000â€“59999 DWT, and (d) Gas Tankers &lt;49999 CBM. Furthermore, the fuel price fluctuation and carbon taxation were used to investigate the sensitivity of baseline Marginal Abatement Cost Curves. The measures, which remain cost-effective under all sensitivity analyses, undergo a Pareto Analysis and a Marginal Cost-Effectiveness Analysis. The results suggest that most of the recommended mitigation measures are of an operational and technical nature, with exception the burning of Liquified Natural Gas and the installation of Flettner Rotors for the Gas Tankers. The company could save up to 17% CO2 emissions and approximately 2 million dollars per year compared to the 2019 baseline by employing all recommended mitigation measures to all vessel categories. In addition, Carbon Storage and Capture could become a cost-effective solution with appropriate carbon taxation, but it is not the ultimate solution since it does not lead to independence from fossil fuels. The study also reveals that depending on the operating condition, even within the same vessel category, different mitigation measures should be employed.

My overarching argument is that iron fertilization geoengineering is not consistent with the feminist values of justice embedded in feminist standpoint theory and feminist contextual empiricism. Alternative mitigation strategies, on the other hand, go much further in meeting these objectives and virtues.	feminism; climate change; gender; geoengineering; environment; standpoint	2018	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761063	24872	2022.2892	Ferroelectrics in Photocatalysis	The rapid development of industrialization and population has brought water, air-pollution and energy crises. Solar-driven catalysis is expected to relieve these issues. However, limited by poor light harvesting, serious charge recombination of semiconductors, and high surface reaction barriers, the low efficiency of solar conversion is far from satisfactory for industrial needs. Ferroelectrics are considered to be promising photocatalysts to overcome these shortcomings. Herein, perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO3, PbTiO3, BiFeO3 and LiNbO3, layered bismuth-based ferroelectrics like Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6, and other ferroelectrics are introduced, and their crystal structure, polarity source and synthetic method are highlighted. Subsequently, research progress in ferroelectrics for photocatalysis is summarized, including pollution degradation, water splitting and CO2 reduction. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of ferroelectric photocatalysts are provided. The purpose of this review is not only to provide a timely summary for the application of ferroelectrics in photocatalysis, but also to present deep insight and a guideline for future research work into ferroelectrics.	built-in electric fields; charge separation; ferroelectrics; ferroelectric switch; photocatalysis	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761075	5927	2012.269	Sea-level rise impacts on Africa and the effects of mitigation and adaptation: an application of DIVA	This paper assesses sea-level rise impacts on Africa at continental and national scales including the benefits of mitigation and of applying adaptation measures, considering four scenarios of global mean sea-level rises from 64 to 126 cm in the period of 1995-2100. We find that in 2100, 16-27 million people are expected to be flooded per year, and annual damage costs range between US\$ 5 and US\$ 9 billion, if no adaptation takes place. Mitigation reduces impacts by 11-36\%. Adaptation in the form of building dikes to protect against coastal flooding and nourishing beaches to protect against coastal erosion reduces the number of people flooded by two orders of magnitude and cuts damage costs in half by 2100. Following such a protection strategy would require substantial investment. First, Africa's current adaptation deficit with respect to coastal flooding would need to be addressed. DIVA suggests that a capital investment of US\$ 300 billion is required to build dikes adapted to the current surge regime and US\$ 3 billion per year for maintenance. In addition, between US\$ 2 and US\$ 6 billion per year needs to be spent on protecting against future sea-level rise and socio-economic development by 2100. This suggests that protection is not effective from a monetary perspective but may still be desirable when also taking into account the avoided social impact. We conclude that this issue requires further investigation including sub-national scale studies that look at impacts and adaptation in conjunction with the development agenda and consider a wider range of adaptation options and strategies.	adaptation; africa; climate change impacts; mitigation; sea-level rise	2012	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761077	1958	2014.105	Local levers for change: Mainstreaming ecosystem-based adaptation into municipal planning to foster sustainability transitions	Unprecedented global challenges demand wide-reaching societal modification to ensure life support functions and human well-being. In the absence of adequate international responses to climate change and the need for place-based adaptation, local governments have a pivotal role in fostering sustainability transitions. In this context, the importance of ecosystem-based adaptation is increasingly recognized as a multi-benefit approach that utilizes ecosystem services to harmonize human-environment systems. Although research advocates the mainstreaming of ecosystem-based adaptation to advance sustainable planning, the pathways for its systematic implementation are missing and it remains unclear how local authorities can best integrate this new approach into their core work. The purpose of this study is to increase knowledge of the potential ways to mainstream ecosystem-based adaptation into municipal planning. We investigate four coastal municipalities in southern Sweden (Malmo, Helsingborg, Lomma and Kristianstad) and examine, based on vertical and horizontal integration processes, the key characteristics of existing mainstreaming strategies. Results show that, although ecosystem service planning and climate change adaptation planning together establish the conceptual foundation for ecosystem-based adaptation, related activities are often implemented separately and are rarely comprehensive. We illustrate how combined mainstreaming strategies can reinforce and complement each other and how strong leadership in the integration of processes has the ability to compensate for a lack of guidance or supporting legislation from higher decision-making levels. Finally, we conclude that systemic mainstreaming of sustainability issues is a promising avenue for initiating and promoting sustainability transitions and has the potential to address the criticism that other mainstreaming topics have faced. On this basis, we specify the core characteristics necessary to ensure its effective and meaningful application. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the state of Rio de Janeiro has the highest percentage of exposed population. In this study, we employ a contingent valuation method to explore residents' willingness to pay for sea level rise mitigation policies in Rio de Janeiro. Given the high level of perceived corruption in the state, we also examine whether residents would prefer mitigation efforts be managed by the state government or a more diversified coalition of community stakeholders. Our findings indicate that residents are not willing to pay additional property taxes to fund sea level rise mitigation policies, unless policymakers are transparent with the use of these funds.	sea level rise; contingent valuation; coastal risk governance; perceived corruption; brazil	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91761095	5943	2022.842	The impacts of and responses to place loss in a coastal community in Ireland	This paper explores the impact of place loss due to the loss of a beach from coastal erosion in the community of Courtown, Co. Wexford, Ireland. Using in-depth walking interviews and photo-elicitation, we investigate (i) the experiences and emotional challenges of place loss; (ii) the impacts of place loss and adaptive actions on people-place relationships and; (iii) how individuals re-imagine the future of place following loss. We find that place loss results in emotional responses consistent with solastalgia for many interviewees. Adaptation actions in the form of installation of rock armour to deal with coastal erosion were seen by many as undesirable and amplified the sense of loss experienced. For most, the lack of community engagement in decision-making has created a sense of powerlessness and anxiety around the future of place. Moreover, this sense of powerlessness is amplified for many by concurrent but unrelated policies that incentivised rapid residential development in the area, contributing to changing place identity and community cohesion. Our findings highlight that impacts of environmental change and adaptation on individuals, while significant on their own, unfold within and can be amplified by the context of on-going development issues and decision-making processes. Despite their sense of powerlessness, there is evidence that residents see rich opportunities to re-imagine place if decision-makers can create opportunities to incorporate the voice of local communities.	place loss; solastalgia; place attachment; coastal erosion; adaptation	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761103	391998	2010.9941	Adaptation to Climate Change	Problem: Even if significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions are achieved, some amount of climate change appears to be inevitable. Local, regional, state, and federal planning and regulation should begin to address how to adapt to these changes. Purpose: This article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, using California as a case study. We examine the institutional and regulatory challenges and tradeoffs that climate change poses in six particularly vulnerable areas: water resources, electricity, coastal resources, air quality, public health, and ecosystem resources. We discuss obstacles to adaptation planning and successes overcoming these barriers, and suggest how planning can incorporate adaptation. Methods: This article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, drawing on our recent research on California's experience and related literature. We summarize the results of six studies that draw on quantitative and qualitative information gathered through surveys, interviews, and literature review. Results and conclusions: Planners should use forward-looking climate data that include higher water and air temperatures, sea-level rise, and increased numbers of extreme events like heat waves, floods, and wildfires when making decisions about future development, infrastructure investments, open-space protection, and disaster preparedness. Climate change will exacerbate conflicts between goals for economic development, habitat protection, and public safety, requiring stronger interagency coordination and new laws and regulations. Takeaway for practice: Local and regional planners can help society adapt to a changing climate by using the best available science, deciding on goals and early actions, locating relevant partners, identifying and eliminating regulatory barriers, and encouraging the introduction of new state mandates and guidelines.

It is thus advisable to study residents' preferences for mitigation strategies. Willingness-to-pay (WTP) by permanent and secondary residents for flood protection provided to properties by Languedoc-Roussillon beaches (French Mediterranean coast) is investigated by a contingent valuation study. Results show that WTP is more influenced by risk perception variables than by socio-economic ones. The WTP is then extrapolated on the basis of different adaptation strategies (laissez-faire, managed retreat, denial etc.) which provided information about expected damage associated with sea level rise at the 2100 time horizon.	sea level rise; economic valuation; beaches; mitigation measures; climate change	2015	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761114	131	2018.14	Benefits of adapting to sea level rise: the importance of ecosystem services in the French Mediterranean sandy coastline	This article proposes an innovative approach to assess the benefits of adapting to sea level rise (SLR) in a coastal area on a regional scale. The valuation framework integrates coastal ecosystem services, together with urban and agricultural assets. We simulate the impacts of a progressive 1 m rise in sea level in the twenty-first century and an extreme flooding event in 2100 for four contrasted adaptation scenarios (Denial, ``Laissez-faire{''}, Protection and Retreat). The assessment involves coupling the results of hazard-modelling approaches with different economic valuation methods, including direct damage functions and methods used in environmental economics. The framework is applied to the French Mediterranean sandy coastline. SLR will result in major land-use changes at the 2100 time horizon: relocation or densification of urban areas, loss of agricultural land, increase in lagoon areas and modification of wetlands (losses, migration or extension of ecosystems). Total benefits of public adaptation options planned in advance could reach (sic)31.2 billion for the period 2010-2100, i.e. (sic)69,000 per inhabitant (in the study area) in 2010 or (sic)135 million/km of coastline. Our results highlight the importance of (i) raising awareness to ensure that public services and coastal managers can anticipate the consequences of SLR and (ii) incorporating coastal ecosystems into the assessment of the adaptation options. Our findings could provide a basis for participatory foresight approaches to build coastline adaptation pathways.	sea level rise; ecosystem services; adaptation options; climate change; economic valuation	2018	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

However, it has been questioned on the grounds on the model's sustainability and resilience to climate change-induced salinity intrusion along with economic and environmental constraints. This paper aims to explore perspectives of mangrove-shrimp farmers in the coastal province of Ben Tre of the VMD from their willingness to sustain the livelihood. We utilized a Motivation and Ability framework in combination with a sustainable livelihood framework to measure the perceived values and resilience of mangrove-shrimp farming systems, based on a broad interview with farmers, scientists, and experts. Farmer interviews presented a high ability of farmers in maintaining the mangrove-shrimp model, but low motivation for development. Water pollution and shrimp disease are the highest risks that would be exacerbated by extreme salinity intrusion. Resilience and sustainability of the mangrove-shrimp livelihoods are relatively low under the impact of extreme salinity intrusion. Also, interviews with scientists and experts revealed a poor perception of farmers in implementing laws in agricultural land and water management, their lack of cooperation with local authorities, and their roles to be less likely involved in project implementation processes which are not supportive for sustaining the mangrove-shrimp models. In the end, an evidence-based framework was proposed to improve the situation. This study sought to contribute meaningful and concrete recommendations to sustain this livelihood model not only for Vietnamese but also for those in coastal areas over the world.	climate change; land-use transformation; mangroveshrimp; mekong delta; socioecology; resilience	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761117	13758	2022.1906	Symposium review: Effective nutritional strategies to mitigate enteric methane in dairy cattle	Intensive research in the past decade has resulted in a better understanding of factors driving enteric methane (CH4) emissions in ruminants. Meta-analyses of large databases, developed through the GLOBAL NETWORK project, have identified successful strategies for mitigation of CH4 emissions. Methane inhibitors, alternative electron sinks, vegetable oils and oilseeds, and tanniferous forages are among the recommended strategies for mitigating CH4 emissions from dairy and beef cattle and small ruminants. These strategies were also effective in decreasing CH4 emissions yield and intensity. However, a higher inclusion rate of oils may negatively affect feed intake, rumen function, and animal performance, specifically milk components in dairy cows. In the case of nitrates (electron sinks), concerns with animal health may be impeding their adoption in practice, and potential emission trade-offs have to be considered. Tannins and tanniferous forages may have a negative effect on nutrient digestibility, and more research is needed to confirm their effects on overall animal performance in long-term experiments with high-producing animals. A meta-analysis of studies with dairy cows fed the CH4 inhibitor 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) at the Pennsylvania State University showed (1) a consistent 28 to 32\% decrease in daily CH4 emissions or emissions yield and intensity; (2) no effect on dry matter intake, milk production, body weight, or body weight change, and a slight increase in milk fat concentration and yield (0.19 percentage units and 90 g/d, respectively); 3-NOP also appears to increase milk urea nitrogen concentration; (3) an exponential decrease in the mitigation effect of the inhibitor with increasing its dose (from 40 to 200 mg/kg of feed dry matter, corresponding to 3-NOP intake of 1 to 4.8 g/ cow per day); and (4) a potential decrease in the efficacy of 3-NOP over time, which needs to be further investigated in long-term, full-lactation or multiple-lactation studies. The red macroalga Asparagopsis taxiformis has a strong CH4 mitigation effect, but studies are needed to determine its feasibility, long-term efficacy, and effects on animal production and health. We concluded that widespread adoption of mitigation strategies with proven effectiveness by the livestock industries will depend on cost, government policies and incentives, and willingness of consumers to pay a higher price for animal products with decreased carbon footprint.	asparagopsis taxiformis; enteric methane; mitigation; 3-nitrooxypropanol; dairy cow	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761123	1678	2012.78	Lagged social-ecological responses to climate and range shifts in fisheries	While previous research has documented marine fish and invertebrates shifting poleward in response to warming climates, less is known about the response of fisheries to these changes. By examining fisheries in the northeastern United States over the last four decades of warming temperatures, we show that northward shifts in species distributions were matched by corresponding northward shifts in fisheries. The proportion of warm-water species caught in most states also increased through time. Most importantly, however, fisheries shifted only 10-30 \% as much as their target species, and evidence suggested that economic and regulatory constraints played important roles in creating these lags. These lags may lead to overfishing and population declines if not accounted for in fisheries management and climate adaptation. In coupled natural-human systems such as fisheries, human actions play important roles in determining the sustainability of the system and, therefore, future conservation and climate mitigation planning will need to consider not only biophysical changes, but also human responses to these changes and the feedbacks that these responses have on ecosystems.

91761125	214603	2020.7057	Assessing natural capital value in the network of Italian marine protected areas: a comparative approach	Marine and coastal natural capital stocks provide a bundle of ecosystem services vital for human well-being. The biophysical and economic assessment of the value of natural capital stocks is much needed for achieving nature conservation goals, while ensuring the sustainable exploitation of marine resources. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are increasingly being established worldwide to protect and conserve natural capital stocks from anthropogenic threats. In this study, a biophysical and trophodynamic model based on the emergy accounting method was used to assess the value of natural capital for a set of Italian MPAs. In particular, the assessment focused on four main macro-habitats: 1) sciaphilic hard bottom (SHB), 2) photophilic hard bottom (PHB), 3) soft bottom (SB), and 4) Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds (PSB). The emergy method allowed the assessment of natural capital stocks in terms of direct and indirect solar energy flows invested by nature for their generation. The SHB habitat showed the highest emergy density value in most of the investigated MPAs, confirming the high convergence of input resource flows in the formation of this habitat. When considering extensive indicators, the contribution of the PSB habitat to the total value of natural capital was higher than other habitats in most MPAs. In addition, to facilitate the understanding of the results in socio-economic contexts, the biophysical values of natural capital stocks were converted into monetary units. The total value of natural capital in the investigated MPAs ranged from about 8 to 1163 M(sic). In conclusion, assessing the value of natural capital can support local managers and policy makers in charge for achieving nature conservation targets while ensuring the sustainable exploitation of natural resources.	environmental accounting; natural capital; marine ecosystems; marine protected areas	2020	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761136	21909	2016.1535	A Dark Hole in Our Understanding of Marine Ecosystems and Their Services: Perspectives from the Mesopelagic Community	In the face of increasing anthropogenic pressures acting on the Earth system, urgent actions are needed to guarantee efficient resource management and sustainable development for our growing human population. Our oceans-the largest underexplored component of the Earth system-are potentially home for a large number of new resources, which can directly impact upon food security and the wellbeing of humanity. However, the extraction of these resources has repercussions for biodiversity and the oceans ability to sequester green house gases and thereby climate. In the search for ``new resources{''} to unlock the economic potential of the global oceans, recent observations have identified a large unexploited biomass of mesopelagic fish living in the deep ocean. This biomass has recently been estimated to be 10 billion metric tons, 10 times larger than previous estimates however the real biomass is still in question. If we are able to exploit this community at sustainable levels without impacting upon biodiversity and compromising the oceans' ability to sequester carbon, we can produce more food and potentially many new nutraceutical products. However, to meet the needs of present generations without compromising the needs of future generations, we need to guarantee a sustainable exploitation of these resources. To do so requires a holistic assessment of the community and an understanding of the mechanisms controlling this biomass, its role in the preservation of biodiversity and its influence on climate as well as management tools able to weigh the costs and benefits of exploitation of this community.	mesopelagic community; food provision; climate regulation; biodiversity; benefits risks	2016	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761139	15911	2021.2066	A blue carbon ecosystems qualitative assessment applying the DPSIR framework: Local perspective of global benefits and contributions	Mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes or collectively known as blue carbon ecosystems are gaining salience because of their essential roles in reducing the risks and impacts of climate change through carbon sequestration and other beneficial services. Despite this, they are globally declining because of their vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Similar trends are also observed in Busuanga Island, Palawan province in the Philippines, where blue carbon ecosystems along with other coastal environments are perceived to be threatened by a number of factors. To better understand the state changes of blue carbon ecosystems, we collected the drivers and pressures and their impact on the whole coastal ecosystem as well as existing management responses by interviewing 26 stakeholders representing community organizations, non-government organizations, and municipal level government units from two municipalities (Busuanga and Coron) in the island. We used the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to analyze the information gathered from the interviews. The results of this study show that lack of institutional capacities (indirect driver) is the leading factor that hinders the progress or efficacy of the management. Most pronounced pressures caused by direct drivers to blue carbon ecosystems include overexploitation and coastal developments. The responses collected in the interviews can be grouped into policies and implementation, capacity building development, welfare and livelihood development, ecosystems management, and tourism measures. The information gathered in this study can be used to improve or change existing responses into more precise and contextualized measures in addressing specific impacts observed in the local areas.	blue carbon ecosystems; dpsir framework; thematic analysis; stakeholders; philippines	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761143	7450	2017.614	Market driven management of climate change impacts in the Spanish mussel sector	Mussel fanning is the largest aquaculture activity in Spain both in volume and value, being a key pillar for the development of the coastal areas in Galicia (NW Spain), where this production is concentrated. The available scientific knowledge suggests that in the long term the primary productivity of the Galician estuaries will be reduced due to climate change. Consequently, adaptive management will be required to face this challenge. The impact of the likely production decrease will depend, among other factors, on the availability of substitutes, being their identification the main object of this research. So, it was analysed whether this markets are integrated or not through cointegration tests, finding that only the French and the Spanish markets are partially integrated. This implies that since very little substitutes are available for the Galician fresh mussels, decreases in production will not necessarily affect producer's income, as prices increases will compensate the (eventual) reduction in volume. In terms of policy, this study suggests that market intelligence may contribute to an adaptive, pragmatic and flexible framework to face climate change impacts, avoiding too anticipated or blind responses that may result in economic, environmental and social costs.	climate change; mussel farming; cointegration; market intelligence	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761145	33155	2016.2157	Carbon stocks of mangroves and losses arising from their conversion to cattle pastures in the Pantanos de Centla, Mexico	The conservation of mangroves and other coastal ``blue carbon{'' ecosystems is receiving heightened attention because of recognition of their high ecosystem carbon stocks as well as vast areas undergoing land conversion. However, few studies have paired intact mangroves with degraded sites to determine carbon losses due to land conversion. To address this gap we quantified total ecosystem carbon stocks in mangroves and cattle pastures formed from mangroves in the large wetland complex of the Pantanos de Centla in SE Mexico. The mean total ecosystem carbon stocks of fringe and estuarine tall mangroves was 1358 Mg C/ha. In contrast the mean carbon stocks of cattle pastures was 458 Mg C/ha. Based upon a biomass equivalence of losses from the top 1 m of mangrove soils, the losses in carbon stocks from mangrove conversion are conservatively estimated at 1464 Mg CO(2)e/ha. These losses were 7-fold that of emissions from tropical dry forest to pasture conversion and 3-fold greater than emissions from Amazon forest to pasture conversion. However, we found that limiting ecosystem carbon stocks differences to the surface 1 m or even 2 m soil depth will miss losses that occurred from deeper horizons. Mangrove conversion to other land uses comes at a great cost in terms of greenhouse gas emissions as well losses of other important ecosystem services.	blue carbon; carbon stocks; carbon dynamics; cattle pastures; climate change mitigation; emissions; land use; mangroves	2016	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761146	47373	2020.4295	Pond Excavation Reduces Coastal Wetland Carbon Dioxide Assimilation	Coastal wetlands comprise important global carbon sinks; however, anthropogenic disturbance accompanied with accelerating sea level rise threaten their continued survival. In this study, we quantified habitat disturbance to salt marshes in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, resulting from the construction of ponds for mosquito control. Geographic object-based image analysis of high-resolution four-band aerial imagery revealed that over 7,000 ponds were constructed in the marsh complex with pond densities as high as 290 ponds per km(2). Physical disturbance from pond creation and sediment dispersal extended to over 17\% of the bay's tidal wetlands. By tracking recolonization of vegetation, we estimated that it took 5 years for 51\% vegetation recovery and 10 years for 69\% recovery, with complete recover (100\%) not expected for more than 50 years. This suggests that efforts to extend the lifespan of drowning coastal wetlands through sediment additions might disrupt carbon dioxide assimilation, as effects of disturbance persist. Focusing on greenhouse gas exchange, our work found that areas of marsh vegetation contribute to carbon assimilation (-42 g C . m(-2) . year(-1)), while ponds and areas of bare peat created by pond excavation were associated with carbon emissions (44 and 125 g C . m(-2) . year(-1), respectively). These results suggest that the conversion of wetlands to ponds-which is a significant driver of coastal wetland loss worldwide-may convert coastal wetlands from greenhouse gas sinks to sources. Additionally, quantifying the area of vegetation within a marsh (vs. bare ground or open water) is important for quantifying their greenhouse gas mitigation function. Plain Language Summary Coastal wetlands are important for our planet as they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Our goal was to determine how the construction of ponds in wetlands-which is common worldwide to support expanding aquaculture-affects the ability of marshes to take up carbon dioxide. We estimated the number and extent of ponds constructed for mosquito control in coastal wetlands in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey. Additionally, we measured greenhouse gas exchange from the ponds, surrounding intact marsh, and in bare areas at several sites across the growing season to estimate the total carbon uptake of the whole marsh. We found that over 7,000 ponds have been dug for mosquito control in New Jersey and that pond density is as high as 290 ponds per km(2). We also found that the ponds constructed in wetlands reduce the ability of wetlands to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.	pond construction; carbon dioxide; methane; mosquito; omwm; open marsh water management	2020	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761148	3631	2021.503	Aboveground biomass and its spatial distribution pattern of herbaceous marsh vegetation in China	Herbaceous marsh is the most widely distributed type of marsh wetland ecosystem, and has important ecological functions such as water conservation, climate regulation, carbon storage and fixation, and sheltering rare species. The carbon sequestration function of herbaceous marsh plays a key role in slowing climate warming and maintaining regional environmental stability. Vegetation biomass is an important index reflecting the carbon sequestration capacity of wetlands. Investigating the biomass of marsh vegetation can provide a scientific basis for estimating the carbon storage and carbon sequestration capacity of marshes. Based on field survey data of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation and the distribution data set of marsh in China, we analyzed the aboveground biomass and its spatial distribution pattern of herbaceous marsh on a national scale for the first time. The results showed that in China the total area of herbaceous marsh was 9.7x10(4) km(2), the average density of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation was 227.5 +/- 23.0 g C m(-2) (95\% confidence interval, the same below), and the total aboveground biomass was 22.2 +/- 2.2 Tg C (1 Tg=10(12) g). The aboveground biomass density of herbaceous marsh vegetation is generally low in Northeast China and the Tibetan Plateau, and high in central North China and coastal regions in China. In different marsh distribution regions of China, the average biomass density of herbaceous marsh vegetation from small to large was as follows: temperate humid and semi-humid marsh region (182.3 +/- 49.3 g C m(-2))<Tibetan Plateau marsh region (243.9 +/- 26.6 g C m(-2))<temperate arid and semi-arid marsh region (300.5 +/- 73.2 g C m(-2))<subtropical humid marsh region (348.4 +/- 59.0 g C m(-2))<coastal marsh region (675.4 +/- 73.8 g C m(-2)). Due to the different area of herbaceous marsh, the total above-ground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in different marsh distribution regions was the largest in the temperate humid and semi-humid marsh region (9.6 +/- 2.6 Tg C), and was the smallest in the coastal marsh region (1.1 +/- 0.1 Tg C). The spatial distribution of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in China has obvious non-zonality characteristics, but also presents certain zonality in some regions. The aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in the Tibetan Plateau decreased with the increase of altitude. With the aggravation of drought, the aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in temperate humid and semi-humid regions and temperate arid and semi-arid regions decreased first and then did not obviously change. The aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in temperate humid and semi-humid regions was relatively larger in the regions with higher average annual temperature. The results can provide scientific basis for accurately evaluating the adjustment action of wetland ecosystems on climate, and provide decision support for adaptive management of wetland ecosystems.	herbaceous marsh; wetland; vegetation; aboveground biomass; spatial distribution; china	2021	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761159	13495	2021.1843	Financing resilience efforts to confront future urban and sea-level rise flooding: Are coastal megacities in Association of Southeast Asian Nations doing enough?	Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to a rise in temperatures, accompanied by rising sea levels threatening low-lying coastal cities. This vulnerability is especially acute in developing countries' cities. This study reviews whether Bangkok, Manila, and Jakarta, less prepared emerging urban centers of developing countries, are investing in adaptation projects for resilience against sea-level rise and urban flooding. Sea-level rise and urban flooding resilience projects were identified in the selected cities through secondary research methods, data on multilateral climate funds, and other aggregated funding databases such as Aid Atlas, Cities Adaptation Action, and City Risk Index. Our findings show that even though these cities do have some adaptation projects to address coastal flooding and rising sea-level threats, the funding has been disparate and dispersed due to a lack of continuous, sizeable, and diverse financing options and does not come close to the requirement, given the risks, of covering potential disaster-related losses. Our findings further highlight the need to expand financing beyond multilateral funds and bilateral funding agreements and to include financial mechanisms that incentivize potential stakeholders to invest in projects that ordinarily are considered nonrevenue generating.	climate finance; cities; resilience; sea-level rise; adaptation; urban flooding	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761166	7121	2019.754	Personalized risk messaging can reduce climate concerns	One potential barrier to climate policy action is that individuals view climate change as a problem for people in other parts of the world or for future generations. As some scholars argue, risk messaging strategies that make climate change personally relevant may help overcome this barrier. In this article, we report a large-n survey experiment on San Francisco Bay Area residents to investigate how providing spatially-resolved risk information to individuals shapes their climate risk perceptions in the context of sea-level rise. Our results suggest that personalized risk messaging can sometimes reduce concern about sea-level rise. These experimental effects are limited to respondents who believe that climate change is happening. Further, we do not find an effect of providing local risk messages on an individual's willingness to pay for regional climate adaptation measures. Our results emphasize that local messaging strategies around sea-level rise risks may not have the clear impacts that some advocates and scholars presume.	risk perceptions; climate change adaptation; sea-level rise; communication	2019	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

We develop, test, and deploy a survey instrument that asks regional stakeholders to assess adaptation readiness and identify barriers to regional adaptation. Informed by the work of Ford and King (Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Chang 20:505-526, 2015) and Moser and Ekstrom (Proc Natl Acad Sci 107:22,026-22,031, 2010), this study operationalizes a conceptual framework for diagnosing barriers to adaptation readiness and applies it to the specific case of SLR adaptation in the Hampton Roads region of southeastern Virginia. In doing so, this work offers insights from three understudied aspects: (1) barriers to adaptation readiness, (2) a regional focus, and (3) a multi-sectoral perspective. Our survey results indicate that the key barriers to adapting to SLR occur during the planning phase of the adaptation process and the transition into the managing phase of the process. Almost 60 \% of survey respondents identified implementation as one of the three most challenging phases of regional adaptation. Fifty-one percent and 36 \% identified development of options and selection of options, respectively, as most challenging. Some barriers to implementation identified in the survey include conflicting mandates, lack of consensus, and lack of financial resources. We examine and discuss these barriers and how they can be overcome, allowing us to identify and characterize overarching factors essential for creating an enabling environment for adaptation. In proposing an integrated conceptual framework linking capacity, readiness, and barriers, our study thus provides an analytical and practical approach for determining adaptation readiness at the regional level, offering implications for regional governance and the practice of adaptation that spans multiple sectors.	adaptation readiness; regional governance; multi-sectoral governance; sea level rise; adaptation barriers	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761168	13589	2021.1854	Climate change mitigation on tropical peatlands: A triple burden for smallholder farmers in Indonesia	The agricultural use and conversion of tropical peatlands is considered a major source of land-based greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the protection and restoration of tropical peatlands has recently turned into an important strategy to mitigate global climate change. Little research exists that has investigated the impacts and dynamics that such climate mitigation efforts evoke in local communities living in and around peatlands. We present in-sights on this from Sumatra, Indonesia and use a climate justice lens to evaluate local outcomes. We show how an increasingly transnational network of state and non-state actors has become involved in developing new laws, policy programs and land-use agreements on Sumatra's coastal peatlands, aiming at supposedly win-win low-carbon development pathways. We argue that such efforts are open to much of the same criticism that has been raised regarding previous policies and projects aimed at reducing GHGE from deforestation and forest degradation. These projects disregard local perspectives on development, fail to deliver the promised benefits and, through a reconfiguration of local land-use rights, reduce the capabilities of smallholder farmers to benefit from their land. In sum, our analysis suggests that recent policies and projects aimed at mitigating GHGE from tropical peatlands contribute to a redistribution of the global climate mitigation burden onto smallholder farmers in Indonesia. This occurs through their threefold assignment to protect forests, prevent fires and help restore degraded peatlands.	climate change mitigation; climate justice; indonesia; peat fires; peatland restoration; redd plus	2021	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

91761175	275317	2011.504	Ecosystem Carbon Stocks of Micronesian Mangrove Forests	Among the least studied ecosystem services of mangroves is their value as global carbon (C) stocks. This is significant as mangroves are subject to rapid rates of deforestation and therefore could be significant sources of atmospheric emissions. Mangroves could be key ecosystems in strategies addressing the mitigation of climate change though reduced deforestation. We quantified ecosystem C stocks at the seaward, interior, and upland edges of mangroves in the Republic of Palau and Yap, Federated States of Micronesia. The relatively high aboveground biomass coupled with carbon-rich soils resulted in the presence of large ecosystem carbon stocks compared to other tropical forests. Ecosystem C storage at the Palau site ranged from 479Mg/ha in the seaward zone to 1,068Mg/ha in the landward zone; in the Yap site C storage ranged from 853 to 1,385 Mg/ha along this gradient. Soils contained ~70% of the ecosystem C stocks. The elevation range of mangroves was <146 cm, suggesting that projected sea-level rise can influence a large portion of existing stands. Declines in ecosystem carbon stocks will be pronounced if mangroves are replaced by communities adapted to greater inundation such as seagrass communities, where C pools were =7% of that of mangroves (48 Mg C/ha).

91761181	11328	2020.1388	Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) as instruments for promoting national development agendas? An analysis of small island developing states (SIDS)	The `bottom up' formulation of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement is an opportunity for countries to promote synergies between climate action and other development priorities. We hypothesize that countries will have prepared the NDCs strategically such that they reinforce national development agendas. This, we argue, makes sense for countries trying to tackle many social, economic and environmental challenges simultaneously and with limited resources. Examining seven Small Island Developing States (SIDS), we compare the priorities described in their NDCs with those in their national development plans. We find most NDC actions relate generally to themes in the respective national development plan, but the range of sectors they include as climate priorities is narrow and does not reflect the spread of national development agendas. Those sectors most emphasised by SIDS' development plans - governance and institutions, economic management, education, health, transport and land use planning - tend not to be included in NDCs at all. This is surprising for adaptation priorities, given the necessity of addressing not only climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, water and coastal zone management but of also tackling the contextual conditions that make communities vulnerable in the first place. We suggest these patterns may be the result of normative and/or material biases that shape thinking about which sectors are climate-relevant. This is limiting the positive reinforcement that NDCs might otherwise give to development agendas, and is a missed opportunity for policy coherence and greater resilience building. Key policy insights The NDCs provide an opportunity for countries to identify climate actions that also strengthen their sustainable development agendas, which would incentivize their implementation and strengthen the NDC concept going forward. The way adaptation priorities are being defined in the NDCs of SIDS appears limited to a narrow range of sectors that are sensitive to climate impacts. Broadening the way adaptation priorities are identified would, going forward, likely create stronger synergies between the NDCs and national development plans, and would also improve climate resilience outcomes.	ndcs; sustainable development; climate policy; adaptation	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761183	5444	2022.782	Contextualising coastal management and adaptation: Examining situated practices and path dependencies in Ireland and Germany	In the context of climate change, coastal areas around the world face multiple interrelated challenges. A range of `international best practice' approaches have been proposed to address these, including concepts such as inte-grated coastal zone management, ecosystem-based management and managed retreat. However, such supposedly mobile and transferable approaches often fail to properly account for the differences between local contexts, leading to implementation failures. In response, this paper mobilises the conceptual lenses of `situated practices' and `path dependencies' to demonstrate how the emergence and evolution of approaches to planning in coastal communities can generate policy trajectories that constrain the latitude for alternative options. The paper ex-plores the trajectories of coastal planning on the island of Sylt in Germany and Castlemaine Harbour in Ireland. It identifies important path dependencies associated with institutional inertia, collective memories of past hazards and management strategies, the legacies of previous coastal management measures and of coastal development, and the importance of property relations. Overall, the analysis highlights the importance of appreciating the local and historical distinctiveness of coastal areas and communities. It shows that critical attention to context and creating inclusive fora for debate is required to advance climate change adaptation measures that offer oppor-tunities to unlock historically anchored path dependencies which hamper flexibility and reduce resilience.	coastal management; climate change adaptation; germany; ireland	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761188	11348	2010.371	Ecosystem Services and Policy: A Review of Coastal Wetland Ecosystem Services and an Efficiency-Based Framework for Implementing the Ecosystem Approach	The Ecosystem Approach (EA) to environmental management aims to enhance human well-being within a linked social and ecological system, through protecting the delivery of benefits and services to society from ecosystems in the face of external pressures such as climate change. However, our lack of understanding of the linkages between the human and natural components of ecosystems inhibits the implementation of the EA for policy decision-making. Coastal wetland systems provide many benefits and ecosystem services to humans, including nutrient recycling, climate and water quality regulation, timber, fuel and fibre, but they are under considerable threat from population pressure and climate change. In this chapter, we review the ecosystem services provided by coastal wetlands, and the threats to these services. We then present a new integrative conceptual framework to underpin the EA. The framework is divided into three sub-systems: one relating to ecosystem functions, one to ecosystem services, and one to social development and well-being. The pathways linking these sub-systems represent transfers of state, for example, ecosystem functions being transferred into ecosystem services, or ecosystem services being transferred into benefits. The focus of our approach is on enhancing the magnitude and efficiency of these transfers, by introducing or making use of any existing catalysts and overcoming any constraints in the system. The framework represents a dynamic system for implementing the EA in which interventions can be planned and managed in an adaptive way.

Clay is one of the most dominant lithology in marine sediments, which has higher water adsorption capacity than sand. In this work, the formation of CO2 hydrate from clay bound water was experimentally investigated by using low-field NMR. The effects of mineral, water content and pressure on the capacity of CO2 storage were analyzed. With the increase of water content, there was a transition of CO2 storage from adsorption on the montmorillonite surface to hydrate formation. The strongly bound water competed with CO2 gas for the adsorption sites on the surface of montmorillonite when the water content was below 15%. Afterwards, CO2 hydrate formation started due to the availability of weakly bound water. The storage of CO2 in hydrate in illite increased continuously with the increase of water content in the range of 5% to 20% due to the low level of strongly bound water. During hydrate formation, the peak position of T2 distribution spectra of the wet clay shifted to the left, indicating an ordered conversion of weakly bound water to hydrate from the outer layer to the inner layer of diffuse double layer. The final amount of CO2 hydrate formed from weakly bound water increased with the elevated pressure due to the variation of activity of the bound water in diffuse double layer. These results will not only broaden the understanding of gas hydrate in clay bound water systems but also promote a new evaluation of the safety and potential of CO2 hydrate storage in clayey sediments.

By the 1980s, the frequency and scale of coastal erosion and land instability had reached a point whereby the local council realised that a change from the previous ad hoc repair and protection approach was needed to secure the long-term future of the town. An environmental improvements initiative was developed from then onwards to provide a strategic and integrated programme of coast protection and cliff stabilisation measures designed to mitigate the increasing threat of climate change, coastal erosion and landslides, while respecting the site's unique heritage and environmental interests. This paper outlines the background and principal phases of the project that have been successfully delivered over the period 1990-2015.	coastal engineering; environment; slopes - stabilisation	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The accumulation rates of organic C (C-org) during the last century varied between and within estuarine zones, ranging from 65 to 1073 g C(org)m(-2)yr(-1). The mean stocks of C-org and N for the top 1 m soils were 263 +/- 14 Mg C-org ha(-1)and 11.8 +/- 0.4 Mg N ha(-1), respectively. We found a less variable distribution pattern on C-org and N stocks throughout the salinity gradient than along the intertidal gradient, being significantly higher at the fringe mangroves than at the interior forest. We estimated that Brazil, one of the major reservoirs of mangroves (similar to 10\%) on the planet, has 207 +/- 34 Tg C-org in the upper meter of soils, which represents 3-8\% of the C stored in mangrove soils globally. Given that Brazil is a Blue Carbon hotspot, it is emphasized the urgent need for the establishment of better mangrove conservation practices and a comprehensive evaluation of their value in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies for reducing CO2 emissions.

91761218	2651	NA.44	Biomethane production kinetics during the anaerobic co-digestion of Sargassum spp. and food waste using batch and fed-batch systems in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic	Collecting Sargassum spp. biomass and using it for the generation of renewable energy is a sustainable approach to mitigate the costs associated to this weed management. The biomethanation of this algal biomass with other organic waste to produce biogas promotes the integrated sustainable management of these materials while generating gaseous fuel for the tourism industry. The purpose of this work is to determine the percentage Sargassum spp. biomass during the anaerobic co-digestion of this brown algae with food waste that results in the best biogas composition, methane yield, production kinetics, and digestate. The biomethanation was conducted in 1200 L fed-batch and bench scale batch biodigestors and the kinetic parameters were estimated using the modified Gompertz model. The methane yield of Sargassum spp. and food waste combinations in 0.58 OLR at fed batch and 15 g/L organic load at batch were comparable. The methane yield produced in the 100\% Sargassum spp. fed-batch anaerobic biodigester was 101.3 +/- 23.6 N. L CH4/kg, but up to 615.5 +/- 78.4 N. L CH4/kg in the 45\% Sargassum spp. / 55\% food waste biodigestor. The anaerobic co-digestion of Sargassum spp. and food waste in the batch system showed methane production rates as high as 14.6 +/- 0.3 N.L CH4/kg.day. Higher H2S were detected in the biogas of the biodigesters fed with larger percentages of the Sargassum spp. with more than 5000 ppm during mono-digestion. Our results suggest that 55\% Sargassum spp. and 45\% food waste are the most promising feed combination under the studied conditions for the anaerobic co-digestion of these feedstock at larger scale.	anaerobic digestion; seaweed; biodigester; methane production rate; digestate	NA	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The analyzed data were continuously observed for nearly 1 year in a semi-enclosed bay. Observed pCO2 tended to be higher than the linear regression in summer and fall, when false-positives would be more frequent. It is inferred that the difference in the air-sea equilibrium timescale between CO2 and O2 as well as high water temperature cause the higher pCO2 in fall while the higher pCO2 in summer is associated with hypoxic water. Continuous observations showed features of pCO2 and DO\% variations more clearly than multiyear sporadic observations. This study provides data on anomalies necessary for developing strategies for marine monitoring.	marine monitoring; pco2; dissolved oxygen; leakage; ccs	2021	Devi	Laurent	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Wind generation is crucial to meet the UK Renewable Obligation which requires certain percentage of renewable electricity in the UK electricity generation. This paper analyses implications of Renewable Obligation and climate change mitigation policy in regional electricity generation mix and regional renewable electricity trade in the UK low carbon scenarios. The newly developed 2 region UK MARKAL model has been used for the analysis. UK is divided into two regions: Scotland and rest of the UK Spatial off-shore wind resource data has been used for the modeling by quantifying the UK continental off-shore wind resources into several zones. Analysis shows that renewable electricity flow between Scotland and rest of the UK is heavily influenced by renewable obligations in the short-and medium-term while climate change policy influence in the long-term.	renewable obligation; uk; climate policy; markal	2010	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761231	268	2014.12	Climate Change Adaptation: Putting Principles into Practice	Carrying out wildlife conservation in a changing climate requires planning on long timescales at both a site and network level, while also having the flexibility to adapt actions at sites over short timescales in response to changing conditions and new information. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), a land-owning wildlife conservation charity in the UK, achieves this on its nature reserves through its system of management planning. This involves setting network-wide objectives which inform the 25-year vision and 5-year conservation objectives for each site. Progress toward achieving each site's conservation objectives is reviewed annually, to identify any adjustments which might be needed to the site's management. The conservation objectives and 25-year vision of each site are reviewed every 5 years. Significant long-term impacts of climate change most frequently identified at RSPB reserves are: loss of intertidal habitat through coastal squeeze, loss of low-lying islands due to higher sea levels and coastal erosion, loss of coastal freshwater and brackish wetlands due to increased coastal flooding, and changes in the hydrology of wetlands. The main types of adaptation measures in place on RSPB reserves to address climate change-related impacts are: re-creation of intertidal habitat, re-creation and restoration of freshwater wetlands away from vulnerable coastal areas, blocking artificial drainage on peatlands, and addressing pressures on freshwater supply for lowland wet grasslands in eastern and southeastern England. Developing partnerships between organizations has been crucial in delivering large-scale adaptation projects.	climate change adaptation; nature reserves; protected areas; management planning; adaptive management	2014	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761248	268185	2022.4792	CO2 capture by pumping surface acidity to the deep ocean	To remain below 2 Â°C of warming, most IPCC pathways call for active CO2 removal (CDR). On geological timescales, ocean uptake regulates atmospheric CO2 concentration, with two homeostats driving CO2 uptake: dissolution of deep ocean carbonate deposits (1 ka timescales) and terrestrial weathering of silicate rocks (100 ka timescales). Many current ocean-based CDR proposals effectively act to accelerate the latter. Here we present a method which relies purely on the redistribution and dilution of acidity from a thin layer of the surface ocean to a thicker layer of deep ocean, in order to reduce surface acidification and accelerate carbonate homeostasis. This downward transport could be seen analogous to the action of the natural biological carbon pump. The method offers advantages over other ocean alkalinity and CO2-stripping methods: the conveyance of mass is minimized (acidity is pumped in situ to depth), and expensive mining, grinding and distribution of alkaline material is eliminated. No dilute substance needs to be concentrated, reducing the quantity of seawater to be processed. Finally, no terrestrial material is added to the ocean, avoiding significant alteration of seawater ion concentrations or issues with heavy metal toxicity (encountered in mineral-based alkalinity schemes). The artificial transport of acidity accelerates the natural deep ocean compensation by calcium carbonate. It has been estimated that the total compensation capacity of the ocean is on the order of 1500 GtC. We show through simulation that pumping of ocean acidity could remove up to 150 GtC from the atmosphere by 2100 without excessive increase of local pH. The permanence of the CO2 storage depends on the depth of acid pumping. At >3000 m, âˆ¼85% is retained for at least 300 years, and >50% for at least 2000 years. Shallow pumping (<2000 m) offers more of a stop-gap deferral of emissions for a few hundred years. Uptake efficiency and residence time also vary with the location of acidity pumping. Requiring only local resources (ocean water and energy), this method could be uniquely suited to utilize otherwise-unusable open ocean energy sources at scale. We present a brief techno-economic estimate of 130-250$ per tCO2 at current prices and as low as 93$ per tCO2 under modest learning-curve assumptions.

Currently, coastal planners use historical data to estimate the frequency and magnitude of flooding and develop planning tools such as hazard lines. However, in the face of climate variability and change, such flood risk estimation methods and the resultant planning tools are inadequate. This article outlines the steps, assumptions, key complexities and uncertainties associated with developing and applying hazard lines that incorporate sea level change projections. A case study, involving Lake Macquarie City Council in New South Wales, Australia, highlights the advantages and limitations of the hazard line approach at the local council level. The key findings are that hazard lines using global or state-wide sea level change benchmarks typically result in overgeneralised and inconsistent risk assessments and that new methods of flood risk estimation, flood planning and flood mitigation are required. Alternatives recommended include a move away from definitive sea level projections based on state or countrywide approximations towards the development of regionally specific adaptation plans that utilise flexible approaches, such as the identification of critical thresholds and triggers, to manage potential flood risk and enable decision-making under uncertainty.	sea level rise; climate change; coastal zone management; planning; flooding; flood mapping	2014	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91761267	455	2022.66	Invited perspectives: Managed realignment as a solution to mitigate coastal flood risks - optimizing success through knowledge co-production	Nature-based solutions are increasingly suggested for mitigating coastal flood risks in the face of climate change. Managed realignment (MR), a coastal adaptation strategy that entails the landward realignment of coastal defences to restore coastal habitats (often salt marshes), plays a pivotal role in implementing nature-based solutions in the coastal zone. Across Europe, more than 130 sites have been implemented so far, often to harness their potential to mitigate coastal flood risks while restoring coastal habitats (ABPmer, 2021). However, local communities often oppose MR projects, not only because they are seen as returning hard-won land to the sea but also because their coastal protection function is less trusted than traditional hard engineering techniques. This scepticism has foundation. The proclaimed coastal protection function of MRs is based on a broad body of literature on the protective function of natural salt marshes. However, contrary to natural salt marshes, MRs are often semi-enclosed tidal basins with narrow breaches to the open sea/estuary. Recent studies indicate that MR-internal hydrodynamics may significantly reduce their coastal protection, depending on their engineering design. To successfully implement MR, a much-improved scientific knowledge base is needed, as well as a process for addressing community concerns and genuinely engaging stakeholders in decision-making beyond the usual obligatory consultancy approach. Here, we propose the co-production of scientific knowledge with local communities and stakeholders to optimize the success of coastal nature-based solutions and promote community acceptance.

91761276	7099	NA.101	Private sector climate change adaptation of accommodation suppliers in the small island of Koh Tao, Thailand	Small islands are often portrait as being among the most vulnerable tourism destinations to climate change, particularly to impacts from sea level rise. This raises the question of how, if at all, locally bound tourism stakeholders, such as accommodation suppliers, consider climate change risks and if they already invest in adaptation measures. The nature of the concepts of adaptation and adaptation finance, with a lack of universally accepted metrics for its monitoring, allow a theoretical inquiry if mobilized finance can be labeled being climate finance. Against this background, this study investigates to what extent accommodation owner-managers do recognize climate change in their strategic investment decisions. A survey with 112 respondents and in-depth interviews with 16 interviewees were conducted on Koh Tao, Thailand. The findings reveal that most businesses (private sector) already invest in adaptation, whereas it appears to be a rather reactive (unconscious) form of adaptation. This shows that the private sector has an interest in addressing business risks, including climate change. The accommodation suppliers themself, however, likely do not bother how actions that reduce their business risks in regard to natural hazards are being labeled. The findings also show that adaptation behavior of accommodation suppliers appears to be influenced by power dynamics on Koh Tao. There is a concentration of power among a few families. This can hinder a sustainable and climate risk-informed development pathway and investment decisions of individual accommodation businesses.	tourism; climate change; islands; adaptation; koh tao	NA	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761278	2112	2015.161	Resilience and shifts in agro-ecosystems facing increasing sea-level rise and salinity intrusion in Ben Tre Province, Mekong Delta	Coastal areas of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam are increasingly experiencing salinity intrusion in freshwater systems, in part due to climate change induced sea-level rise, compromising agricultural production and domestic water supply. In order to determine which development trajectories could result in resilient agro-ecosystems, a study area in Thanh Phu district, Ben Tre province was selected where the influence of salinity intrusion on agro-ecosystem can be studied along spatial and temporal salinity gradients. The district is divided in three sub-regions: sub-region 3, closest to the coastline, is principally dedicated to brackish-water shrimp farming; more inland, sub-region 2 has a mix of rice-shrimp farming; and further inland, sub-region 1, which is protected from salinity intrusion by a system of dykes, is dedicated principally to rice farming. Household and expert interviews, focus group discussions and a review of policy documents were used to capture historical salinity problems as well as shifts in farming systems. Agricultural activities have changed in the last decades, mainly driven by national-level policies. At present, the development of engineered infrastructures is favoured whereas complementary or alternative solutions to increase the resilience of social-ecological systems with respect to salinity intrusion exist. These include regeneration of coastal ecosystems, agronomic measures, upstream flow control and shifts in agro-ecosystems. The latter would increasingly enable farmers to work under the influence of both saline and freshwater systems allowing income diversification. National authorities have an opportunity to change the business as usual mode of tackling water-related problems including extreme events in the Mekong Delta through infrastructure development by looking at these alternative solutions.

91761283	6273	2018.656	Examining legal and regulatory barriers to climate change adaptation in the coastal zone of the United States	This paper presents an analysis of key legal and regulatory instruments in the United States that impact climate adaptation planning. The analysis is framed within a social-institutional context, meaning the legal-regulatory environment is viewed from the perspective of the practices and norms that are created through existing laws and policies. Those norms and practices are then compared to current best practices for coastal climate adaptation to determine if and where divergence between recommended best practices and existing policy structures occurs. The results of this analysis suggest key policy instruments cumulatively act as barriers to adopting climate change assessment recommendations in coastal regions. The main causes for this disconnect between information and action seem to be historical path dependence, clear counter-incentives favoring coastal development, and multiple narratives of climate change, all of which diminish a unified public demand for coastal adaptation. Enumerated lessons presented from this analysis can be used as conceptual starting points when thinking about translating assessments of climate change into public action. In particular, the social-institutional framework provides an analytical construct for gaining insight into how existing legal and regulatory instruments influence adoption of proposed adaptation strategies, including highlighting when divergence between existing and proposed policies occurs.	climate change; adaptation; climate policy; development; disaster risk management	2018	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Understanding these public responses and their drivers is important, as public support can influence new technology adoption and deployment. Here I review the literature on public perceptions of and responses to a wide range of new energy technologies. Unlike previous reviews that tend to focus on particular technologies or types of technologies, this Review covers both large-scale energy infrastructure projects, such as utility-scale wind and solar, fossil fuel extraction and marine renewables, as well as small-scale, â€˜consumer-facingâ€™ technologies such as electric vehicles, rooftop solar and smart meters. This approach reveals broad trends that may facilitate communication between policymakers, technologists and the public, and support the transition to a more sustainable energy system.

91761294	5238	2017.417	Envisioning robust climate change adaptation futures for coastal regions: a comparative evaluation of cases in three continents	The paper reports on a comparative study of three different cases on vision and strategy development for climate change adaptation planning in (i) The South African Breede-Overberg Catchment, (ii) The Mississippi Estuary-New Orleans region and (iii) The Dutch Rhine-Meuse Estuary. The objective of the paper is twofold: to develop a better understanding of such processes and to further develop the Backcasting-Adaptive Management (BCAM) methodology. A framework for case evaluation is developed using six dimensions: (i) inputs and resources, (ii) future vision, (iii) stakeholder engagement, (iv) methodological aspects, (v) pathway development and (vi) impact. Major conclusions based on a cross-case comparison and testing propositions are (i) participatory vision development is a strong tool for climate change adaptation planning in different governance contexts and shows considerable diversity in its application in these contexts; (ii) a single, shared future vision is not a prerequisite for vision and pathway development and endorsement; (iii) broad stakeholder engagement enriches strategy development, but the involvement of marginal groups requires additional efforts and capacity building; (iv) multiple pathways and robust elements are useful but require novel expertise; and (v) more institutional embeddedness and support for participatory processes lead to better implementation of the outcomes of these processes.	vision development; backcasting; climate adaptation; pathways	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

The article defines and estimates asset-based measures for community vulnerability, resilience, and adaptive capacity with respect to the environmental, economic, social, and cultural pillars of the coastal community under threat. The SD model simulates the annual multidimensional dynamic impacts of severe coastal storms and storm surges on the community pillars under alternative adaptation strategies. The calculation of the quantitative measures provides valuable information for decision makers for evaluating the alternative strategies. The adaptation strategies are designed model results illustrated for the specific context of the coastal community of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada. The dynamic trend of the measures and model sensitivity analyses for Charlottetown-facing increased frequency of severe storms, storm surges, and sea-level rise-provide impetus for enhanced community strategic planning for the changing coastal environment. This research is presented as part of the International Community-University Research Alliance C-Change project ``Managing Adaptation to Environmental Change in Coastal Communities: Canada and the Caribbean{''} sponsored by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the International Development Resource Centre.	canada; charlottetown; climate change adaptation; coastal community resilience; coastal community vulnerability; system dynamics model	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761316	13937	2016.1065	Planning adaptation to climate change in fast-warming marine regions with seafood-dependent coastal communities	Many coastal communities rely on living marine resources for livelihoods and food security. These resources are commonly under stress from overfishing, pollution, coastal development and habitat degradation. Climate change is an additional stressor beginning to impact coastal systems and communities, but may also lead to opportunities for some species and the people they sustain. We describe the research approach for a multi-country project, focused on the southern hemisphere, designed to contribute to improving fishing community adaptation efforts by characterizing, assessing and predicting the future of coastal-marine food resources, and co-developing adaptation options through the provision and sharing of knowledge across fast-warming marine regions (i.e. marine `hotspots'). These hotspots represent natural laboratories for observing change and concomitant human adaptive responses, and for developing adaptation options and management strategies. Focusing on adaptation options and strategies for enhancing coastal resilience at the local level will contribute to capacity building and local empowerment in order to minimise negative outcomes and take advantage of opportunities arising from climate change. However, developing comparative approaches across regions that differ in political institutions, socio-economic community demographics, resource dependency and research capacity is challenging. Here, we describe physical, biological, social and governance tools to allow hotspot comparisons, and several methods to evaluate and enhance interactions within a multi-nation research team. Strong partnerships within and between the focal regions are critical to scientific and political support for development of effective approaches to reduce future vulnerability. Comparing these hotspot regions will enhance local adaptation responses and generate outcomes applicable to other regions.	coastal marine resources; fisheries; food security; livelihoods; vulnerability; governance	2016	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
91761338	5227	2021.698	CLIMADA v1.4.1: towards a globally consistent adaptation options appraisal tool	Climate change is a fact; therefore, adaptation to a changing environment is a necessity. Adaptation is ultimately local, yet similar challenges pose themselves to decision-makers all across the globe and on all levels. The Economics of Climate Adaptation (ECA) methodology has established an economic framework to fully integrate risk and reward perspectives of different stakeholders, underpinned by the CLIMADA (CLIMateADAptation) impact modeling platform. We present an extension of the latter to appraise adaption options in a consistent fashion in order to provide decision-makers from the local to the global level with the necessary facts to identify the most effective instruments to meet the adaptation challenge. We apply the open-source Python implementation to a tropical cyclone impact case study in the Caribbean, using openly available data. This allows us to prioritize a small basket of adaptation options, namely green and gray infrastructure options as well as behavioral measures and risk transfer, and permits inter-island comparisons. In Anguilla, for example, mangroves avert simulated damages more than 4 times the cost estimated for mangrove restoration, whereas the enforcement of building codes is shown to be effective in the Turks and Caicos Islands in a moderate-climate-change scenario. For all islands, cost-effective measures reduce the cost of risk transfer, which covers the damage of high-impact events that cannot be cost-effectively prevented by other measures. This extended version of the CLIMADA platform has been designed to enable risk assessment and options appraisal in a modular form and occasionally bespoke fashion yet with the high reusability of common functionalities to foster the usage of the platform in interdisciplinary studies and international collaboration.

91761357	1794	2018.204	Adapting to change: Prioritising management for the future of the Marine Scalefish Fishery	Marine scalefish fisheries face multiple challenges including management and sustainability pressures. These are going to be amplified by climate change. This paper reports on a project that used the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and semi-structured interviews to assess how marine scalefish fishers in South Australia, prioritise management objectives with a view to incorporating those views into structural industry reform to build the fishery's capacity to adapt in the face of these challenges. The project found that fishers, despite differences in geographical scale, fishing practice and species harvested, prioritised governance objectives most highly, and that economic and environmental objectives were prioritised as key and equally important; one could not exist without the other. Fishers prioritised social objectives the least as they expect these to follow from the economic and environmental objectives. Fishers also felt stocks had declined and that reform was urgently needed. Most fishers agreed that reform should include a reduction in licences. All fishers felt that recreational fishing was under-regulated and compromised commercial fishing opportunities. The project revealed that the capacity of fishers to adapt within the current operating environment is limited and that they will need government and other support to implement reform. For policy makers, this highlights that reform is culturally palatable but that it must include incentives and compensation for fishers to leave or stay in the industry.	fisheries; management; governance; objectives; australia; ahp	2018	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761367	737	2022.104	A roadmap to integrating resilience into the practice of coral reef restoration	Recent warm temperatures driven by climate change have caused mass coral bleaching and mortality across the world, prompting managers, policymakers, and conservation practitioners to embrace restoration as a strategy to sustain coral reefs. Despite a proliferation of new coral reef restoration efforts globally and increasing scientific recognition and research on interventions aimed at supporting reef resilience to climate impacts, few restoration programs are currently incorporating climate change and resilience in project design. As climate change will continue to degrade coral reefs for decades to come, guidance is needed to support managers and restoration practitioners to conduct restoration that promotes resilience through enhanced coral reef recovery, resistance, and adaptation. Here, we address this critical implementation gap by providing recommendations that integrate resilience principles into restoration design and practice, including for project planning and design, coral selection, site selection, and broader ecosystem context. We also discuss future opportunities to improve restoration methods to support enhanced outcomes for coral reefs in response to climate change. As coral reefs are one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to climate change, interventions that enhance reef resilience will help to ensure restoration efforts have a greater chance of success in a warming world. They are also more likely to provide essential contributions to global targets to protect natural biodiversity and the human communities that rely on reefs.	climate change adaptation; coral bleaching; coral reefs; resilience; resilience-based management; restoration	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This paper examines rice farmers' vulnerability, adaptation strategies, and adaptation barriers to managing climate change impacts in the coastal region of Bangladesh. Survey data were collected from 220 randomly selected rice farmers located across two coastal districts of Bangladesh. A multinomial logit model was applied to analyze determinants of adaptation strategies of rice farmers. The results reveal that flood is the main risk to vulnerability, followed by cyclones and storms surges and saline intrusion. The main adaptation strategies are cultivating flood and salinity tolerant rice varieties, direct seeding of rice, supplementary irrigation, cultivation of non-rice crops that have shorter growth duration, and rearing of livestock, poultry, and duck. The econometric analysis shows that factors such as household head's education, household income, farm size, access to information, and extension services significantly influence the choice of adaptation strategies of the rice farmers. We recommend to increase investment in research, training of farmers, and targeted extension services to disseminate climate-smart technologies and information for minimising vulnerability of the farmers.	bangladesh; rice farmer; climate change; vulnerability; adaptation; coastal region	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

This study aimed at evaluating the potential impacts of climate change on two coastal communities on the northern coast of France by producing prospective maps of the coastline by 2065 and at assessing the local inhabitants' risk perception and preferred strategies for facing future coastal risks through a survey of 285 households. The solutions inhabitants considered the more appropriate to preserve their living environment while adapting to the potential impacts of climate change were analyzed. A vast majority of the inhabitants is aware of coastal risks in their municipality, but their feeling of exposure is spatially-influenced depending on the distance to the hazard source. Conversely, no relationship was found between preferred strategies for facing future coastal risks and proximity to the shoreline. In the municipality where only soft defense structures are present, more inhabitants opt for the ``hold the line{''} solution, while in the other municipality where a portion of the coast is protected by a seawall, a much larger proportion of the surveyed residents prefer the adaptation option.	climate change; coastal hazards; risk perception; adaptation strategies	2020	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Challenges related to climate vulnerability and tenure security are exacerbated in areas of rapid urbanisation and urban growth, with highly vulnerable informal settlements a common result. Drawing on research into vulnerable informal settlements in the Greater Suva Urban Area in Fiji, this research seeks to better understand perceptions of climate vulnerability, adaptive capacity, tenure security and options for resettlement. This research confirmed that there are important linkages at the settlement level between tenure security, perception of vulnerability, and people's ability to adapt. Two critical factors in any decision to resettle people are (i) providing tenure security for all people affected, and (ii) considering livelihood impacts as a result of resettlement. We conclude that vulnerability, tenure security and resettlement decisions are complex issues and specific to individual settlements, and to specific households within settlements.	informal settlement; vulnerability; tenure security; resettlement; disaster risk; climate change; adaptive capacity	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Proper steps must be taken to reduce the vulnerability of the farming communities living in coastal areas, especially in the developing countries. This chapter reviews the impact of climate change on the coastal agro-ecosystem, and practices to improve sustainability. We found that 27 countries are the most vulnerable due to accelerated sea level rise. In some coastal areas, up to 40\% biodiversity loss has already been observed. About 70\% income is generated from crop cultivation and the rest is from fisheries and other animal husbandry activities. Hence, climate resilient agriculture can secure the rural livelihood. Adaptation measures may include agro-forestry practices, establishment of orchards, nutrient recycling, salinity management and rational use of water. Techniques of climate resilient agriculture vary with techniques available, needs of the farming community, resources and infrastructure.	coastal ecosystem; climate resilient agriculture; climate change; sea level rise; cyclone	2018	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761410	689	2010.33	Understanding current and future vulnerability in coastal settings: community perceptions and preferences for adaptation in Zanzibar, Tanzania	Many developing countries are already affected by multiple stressors, which have increased their vulnerability to accelerated negative environmental change. Coastal erosion, deforestation and habitat fragmentation become even more serious problems in coastal locations when coupled with the projected impacts of climate change. However, anticipatory adaptation to such changes as increased coastal erosion and extreme events does not need to wait for specific climate scenarios, but is more reliant on the examination of current vulnerabilities and the range of possible no-regret strategies. These need to, however, accommodate multiple stakeholder preferences. This study therefore examines coastal communities' perceptions of environmental change in northeast Zanzibar, Tanzania and their preferences for adaptive strategies, while simultaneously examining physical change processes through change analysis. The study suggests coastal forest buffer zones as an anticipatory adaptation measure, which is based on soft measures such as vegetation planting, awareness raising and stakeholder cooperation.	climate change; vulnerability; coastal communities; coastal forest buffer zones; zanzibar	2010	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761440	12155	2014.661	Beyond the core: community governance for climate-change adaptation in peripheral parts of Pacific Island Countries	Pacific Island Countries are highly exposed to climate change. Most impact studies have focused on the most densely populated core areas where top-down governance is most effective. In contrast, this research looks at peripheral (rural/outer-island) communities where long-established systems of environmental governance exist that contrast markedly with those which governments and their donor partners in this region favour. Peripheral communities in the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, and Vanuatu were studied. Traditional systems of environmental governance are described, and three common barriers to effective and sustainable climate-change adaptation identified. The first is lack of awareness among key community decision makers about climate change and associated environmental sustainability that could be lessened by targeted awareness raising. The second is the inappropriateness of traditional decision-making structures for dealing with both the complexity and pace of climate-driven environmental changes. The third is the short-term views of resource management and sustainability held by many community decision makers. Despite 30 years of assistance, there has been negligible effective and sustainable adaptation for climate change in peripheral parts of Pacific Island Countries, something that is explicable by both the ineffectiveness of top-down approaches in such places as well as a lack of attention to the nature and the context of adaptation communications. It is timely for interventions to be made at community level where the greatest disconnect lies between the science and stakeholder awareness of climate change.	climate change; pacific islands; community governance; adaptation; sustainability; peripheral areas	2014	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Using design thinking techniques as a method of approach, this innovative idea builds a bridge between decision makers and stakeholders, promoting a shared vision of growth and innovation at the community level. The coastal zone is an extremely dynamic area in terms of human and natural activities. This is a particularly sensitive area to climate change, necessitating ongoing adaptation and mitigating action. This paper aims to introduce the application of the Living lab concept in the management of the coastal area of Constanta (Romania). The concept of the Living Lab means involving citizens along with public bodies and research structures. This new coastal management model will use the design thinking approach and will consider the pressures that exist between the activities that occur in the examined coastal zone. In the study, ``Multi-Criteria Analysis of the Mass Tourism Management Model Related to the Impact on the Local Community in Constan \& x21b;a (Romania){''}, published in MDPI Inventions on 28 June 2021, a coastal management model was built that took into consideration only the data given by the government. In this paper, the authors aim to expand their research by including data from independent sources, using the concept of a Living Lab.	living labs; design thinking; management model; coastal zone; integrated coastal zone management (iczm); constanta; black sea; sustainability	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761450	47578	1997.795	The costs and benefits of mitigation: A full-fuel-cycle examination of technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions	Comparison of options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions must take account of many different matters in a consistent manner. A method of full-fuel-cycle analysis has been developed with this aim in mind. In this method, technical options are compared using a measure made up from the `'private costs'' of owning and operating a power station together with the `'external costs'' representing its environmental impact. The method is tested on three types of power generation plant, each of which incorporates CO2 capture and sequestration technology - these include natural gas-fired and coal-fired power plant, as well as CO2 storage in a disused gas field, in the deep ocean or in an off-set forest. Emissions arising from all stages of the fuel cycle are estimated - from extraction of fossil fuel through to dispatch of power to the grid. All types of emission and their impact at local, regional and global level are assessed and valuation of these impacts is attempted. Previous work in this field has concentrated on local impacts, such as occupational health, and regional impacts, such as `'acid rain''.

91761454	3998	2019.436	Marine Social Science for the Peopled Seas	Coastal communities, indigenous peoples, and small-scale fishers rely on the ocean for livelihoods, for subsistence, for wellbeing and for cultural continuity. Thus, understanding the human dimensions of the world's peopled seas and coasts is fundamental to evidence-based decision-making across marine policy realms, including marine conservation, marine spatial planning, fisheries management, the blue economy and climate adaptation. This perspective article contends that the marine social sciences must inform the pursuit of sustainable oceans. To this end, the article introduces this burgeoning field and briefly reviews the insights that social science can offer to guide ocean and coastal policy and management. The upcoming United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) provides a tremendous opportunity to build on the current interest, need for and momentum in the marine social sciences. We will be missing the boat if the marine social sciences do not form an integral and substantial part of the mandate and investments of this global ocean science for sustainability initiative.	marine social science; sustainability; blue economy; fisheries management; marine conservation; ocean governance; marine policy; un decade of ocean science	2019	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761456	6527	2020.803	Adaptation of Fishing Communities to Climate-Driven Shifts in Target Species	Climate change is causing shifts in marine species' distributions, disrupting fishers and fishing communities and threatening food security. These changes affect all fishing activities, from small-scale to industrial fishing, and have implications for livelihoods, economies, and society along the entire seafood supply chain. Understanding fisheries as social-ecological systems (SESs) that include dynamic responses and feedbacks for the targeted stocks, the fishers, and the fishing industry provides an essential standpoint for thinking about fisheries' adaptation to climate change. In this Perspective, we briefly summarize the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of target species' distribution shifts. We propose using a resilience perspective where fishery SESs can respond to climate changes by maintaining, coping, adapting, and/or transforming the system. In this context, we identify what specific actions by individuals, groups, and institutions allow the fishery system to respond in these ways and discuss policy solutions to allow for adaptation and transformation to shifting species distributions.

91761478	7252	2022.1014	Investigating the potential for saltpan restoration for the provision of multiple ecosystem services	Saltpans are increasingly being abandoned around the world, leading to the loss of ecosystem services provided by these unique semi-natural wetlands. The desertion of a saltpan at the Swartkops Estuary, South Africa has left behind a large area of desiccated hypersaline sediment and a sharp decrease in waterbird abundance and diversity. Here, we explore the potential for restoring this saltpan's wetland function using stormwater inflow to support multiple ecosystem services and improve estuary health. Stormwater will be able to flow into the saltpan as a passive restoration approach that can maintain the site as a wetland habitat. This will contribute to improving the health of a nationally important, yet highly degraded, estuary by retaining 758 ML of stormwater to achieve full capacity, containing an estimated 2908 kg of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and 68 kg of dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Additional ecosystem services such as biodiversity maintenance, carbon storage and societal values can be expected. However, this would create a novel hypersaline stormwater wetland and a strategic adaptive management approach will be required. Management must be guided by monitoring, which should comprise collection of basic environmental data to establish a baseline condition, and against which, long term changes and responses resulting from stochastic events can be assessed and mitigated through the use of achievable ecological restoration targets.	din; dip; ecological restoration; hypersaline environments; stormwater management; waterbird conservation; water quality	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761495	303059	2020.2021	Ecosystem Carbon Stock of Selected Mangrove Forests of Vypin - Cochin Region, Southwest Coast of India	In a tropical coastal environment, mangrove ecosystems store large amount of atmospheric carbon in biomass and soil. West coast of India host 29% of the mangrove ecosystems of the country. Putting aside the few scientific studies about the Indian mangroves system, there exist gaps in our scientific knowledge of Blue Carbon domain. This study aims to quantify the ecosystem carbon stocks potential and community structure of mangrove vegetation/ ecosystem species of Vypinâ€“ Cochin, a coastal region of the Southwest coast of India. The information on species-specific carbon storage will benefit to choose best species in the afforestation and conservation initiatives. Distribution, community structure and carbon pools of above and below ground biomass of the study area were assessed. From the analysis, it is evident that the amount of carbon stored in mangroves varies according to species, functional attributes (basal area, DBH, mean height etc.) and region. Avicennia officinalis, Rhizophora mucronata, Acanthus ilicifolius, Acrostichum aureum, Bruguiera cylindrica and Sonneratia caseolaris are the mangrove species observed from the study area. As per the community structure assessment, A. officinalis showed large number, frequency, density, and evenness. While considering biomass, R.mucronata species possess high value. The mean overall above ground biomass of the region was 69.55 Â± 80.38Â tÂ haâˆ’1. Ecosystem carbon stock of the area ranges from 17.7â€“138.8 with an average of 54.3 Â± 36Â tÂ haâˆ’1. Therefore, the findings described will serve as a baseline on carbon stock and mangrove stand structure of the region and their role in Blue Carbon dynamics of the Southwest Coast of India.

In this article, an optimization method for the control and operation of the offshore wind farm as an integrated system considering its operational, economic and environmental impacts is proposed. The state of the offshore wind farm development, and the challenges faced by the offshore wind farms, including the challenges of economic costs, operational reliability, and environmental impacts are reviewed and summarized. A systematic methodology is proposed to optimize the costs of an offshore wind farm system based on a framework that extends from the supervisory level dispatch strategies to individual pitch control for load reduction and fatigue mitigation. This holistic approach is able to improve the efficiency and economic performance of a wind farm through overall system optimization, while explicitly operating each wind turbine using a formally designed control framework leading to an extension of their service lifespan. This work provides thorough introduction and innovative solutions for many economic and environmental issues in offshore wind farm development and has strong application potential.

91761506	47719	2022.4822	How to Incorporate Blue Carbon into the China Certified Emission Reductions Scheme: Legal and Policy Perspectives	Blue carbon, the carbon sequestered in vegetated coastal ecosystems, is a potential and practical approach to combating climate change. Many countries have committed to integrating blue carbon into the climate change law and policy framework. As a significant carbon-emitting country, China has abundant blue carbon resources but suffers a significant loss of coastal habitats. Therefore, blue carbon should become a primary focus in China's climate change law and policy. Given the successful experience in terrestrial biosequestration projects, the inclusion of blue carbon into China's carbon trading market can be an essential move and is the primary purpose of this paper. The China Certified Emission Reductions (CCER) scheme is an effective supplementary mechanism to the national carbon trading market. To incorporate blue carbon into the CCER scheme, this article first analyzes the legislative framework underpinning the CCER scheme and indicates some critical factors, including methodology, project boundaries, legal rights, additionality, project period, and crediting period. Subsequently, the article discusses these critical factors in depth to identify legal issues that may emerge and provides several feasible solutions. (i) Dedicated methodologies need to be developed for blue carbon projects, which include a broader definition for carbon abatement activities. (ii) The new national marine functional zoning should delineate zones for the purpose of developing blue carbon projects. (iii) The current authorization system for the right to use sea areas could be used to secure a legal right to develop blue carbon projects. (iv) Additionality requirements should be appropriately adjusted. (v) Extended project periods and crediting periods would be needed. This article offers novel pathways for including blue carbon in China's climate change law and policy framework, thus contributing to achieving its 2060 carbon neutrality goal.	blue carbon; ccer scheme; carbon neutrality	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91761521	2582	NA.40	Ecosystem-Based Disaster Management Planning for the Eastern Coast of India	The coastal zone of India is endowed with abundant coastal and marine ecosystems. India is also highly prone to natural calamities, especially floods, droughts, cyclones, and landslides. This study aims to highlight the importance of the ecosystem services along the east coast of India and incorporate the value of these resources at the planning stage of disaster management at all levels. A survey was conducted with experts at the national level who have an understanding of the existing disaster management plans along the coast of Tamil Nadu state. To understand the importance of ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction at the decision-making and planning level, further analysis was carried out in monetization of ecosystem services. The total value of ecosystem services was obtained as the product of landuse area and the value of ecosystem services. From the overall critical analysis and the initial online survey, it was inferred that ecosystem-based approaches to disaster risk reduction and managing climate change hold much promise and that investing in healthy ecosystems provides a viable route for sustainable development. There needs to be a shift from relying on structural engineering solutions to increased acceptance of social engineering approaches through consensus building with disaster-affected communities. Despite the structural and nonstructural measures being implemented in lieu of disaster management, there is still a lacuna in effective implementation, as inferred from the study. Robust actions are needed at the planning stage, for which the adoption of ecosystem-based approaches with localised resources and knowledge would be an inclusive approach.	biomass; disaster risk reduction; ecosystem services; monetization; vulnerability risk assessment	NA	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761527	937	2020.124	Managed retreat for climate change adaptation in coastal megacities: A comparison of policy and practice in Manila and Vancouver	`Managed retreat' is gaining considerable attention as part of megacities' climate change adaptation and resilience enhancement toolkits, and as a policy option for disaster risk reduction in coastal regions. The overarching objective of managed retreat is to reduce the exposure of people and assets to flooding, storm surges and sea level rise by retreating from these threats in a planned fashion. Managed retreat is one of four main options covered in the TARA' (protect/accommodate/retreat/avoid) framework explained in this paper, which can be used to enhance resilience in coastal megacities. In this paper, qualitative research methods were used to collect primary data on the feasibility of using managed retreat for two case study coastal megacities: Manila, Philippines, and Vancouver, Canada. Both case studies review the risk context of each city, local climate change adaptation/disaster risk reduction (CCA/DRR) policies linked to managed retreat, examples of managed retreat practice, and barriers to managed retreat identified through primary or secondary data analysis. Comparisons between the two cases are then carried out, and similarities and differences are highlighted. The paper concludes by suggesting possible means by which barriers to managed retreat might be overcome.	managed retreat; climate change adaptation; disaster risk reduction; coastal; megacity; resilience; manila; vancouver	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761528	6269	2000.120	Evaluating the progress of engineered tidal wetlands	New terminology is needed for the assessment of wetland restoration projects, focusing on progress towards ecological goals rather than the yes/no alternative of success versus failure. Mitigation projects should be evaluated based on `compliance' of specific mitigation criteria. Peer-reviewed assessments of wetland restoration projects have focused on appropriate parameters (topographic, hydrologic, soil, vegetation, and animal components); however, for the most part, they have evaluated small, newly restored wetlands over the short-term with little repeated sampling. Future assessments should focus on understanding problems at a particular site by identifying cause-effect mechanisms. We review a case study from San Diego Bay where detailed assessments led to the identification of problems and subsequent management alternatives. We also recommend the use of two novel approaches: experimentation and the evaluation of ecosystem resiliency to unplanned disturbances. These assessments will provide a better understanding of ecosystem functioning and enhance current comparisons of natural and restored systems. A stronger science base for wetland restoration and adaptive management do not guarantee that restoration targets will be reached; however, these approaches will identify the causes of problems and allow us to predict whether or not restoration targets can be leached in a timely manner.

Offshore energy sources, such as offshore wind turbines, are promising alternatives. However, the abnormal climate is a potential threat to the safety of offshore structures because construction guidelines cannot embrace climate outliers. A cosine similarity-based maintenance strategy may be a possible solution for managing and mitigating these risks. However, a study reporting its application to an actual field structure has not yet been reported. Thus, as an initial study, this study investigated whether the technique is applicable or whether it has limitations in the real field using an actual example, the Gageocho Ocean Research Station. Consequently, it was found that damage can only be detected correctly if the damage states are very similar to the comparison target database. Therefore, the high accuracy of natural frequencies, including environmental effects, should be ensured. Specifically, damage scenarios must be carefully designed, and an alternative is to devise more efficient techniques that can compensate for the present procedure.	damage detection; cosine similarity; structural health monitoring; gageocho ocean research station; structural integrity assessment	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761539	13630	2019.1434	Insights from Testing a Modified Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways Approach for Spatial Planning at the Municipal Level	The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach has successfully been used to manage uncertainties in large infrastructure projects. However, the viability of the DAPP approach for spatial planning in smaller municipal settings is not clear. This paper examines opportunities and constraints of using adaptive pathways approaches to help small municipalities plan for future sea-level rise. The methodology was based on developing a simplified DAPP-approach, which was tested in a multiple experimental case study of spatial planning projects in three municipalities in Sweden. The results show that the approach promoted vulnerability-based thinking among the end-users and generated new ideas on how to manage the uncertain long-term impacts of future sea-level rise. However, the increased understanding of uncertainties was used to justify static, rather than adaptive, solutions. This somewhat surprising outcome can be explained by perceived legal constraints, lack of experience of adaptive pathways, and unwillingness to prescribe actions that could prove difficult to enforce in the future. More research is needed to further understand at what planning phases dynamic policy pathway approaches work best and how current barriers in legislation, practices, mind-set, organization, and resources can be overcome.	pathways; adaptation; uncertainty; sea-level rise	2019	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91761567	11915	2022.1642	Attributes of climate resilience in fisheries: From theory to practice	In a changing climate, there is an imperative to build coupled social-ecological systems-including fisheries-that can withstand or adapt to climate stressors. Although resilience theory identifies system attributes that supposedly confer resilience, these attributes have rarely been clearly defined, mechanistically explained, nor tested and applied to inform fisheries governance. Here, we develop and apply a comprehensive resilience framework to examine fishery systems across (a) ecological, (b) socio-economic and (c) governance dimensions using five resilience domains: assets, flexibility, organization, learning and agency. We distil and define 38 attributes that confer climate resilience from a coupled literature- and expert-driven approach, describe how they apply to fisheries and provide illustrative examples of resilience attributes in action. Our synthesis highlights that the directionality and mechanism of these attributes depend on the specific context, capacities, and scale of the focal fishery system and associated stressors, and we find evidence of interdependencies among attributes. Overall, however, we find few studies that test resilience attributes in fisheries across all parts of the system, with most examples focussing on the ecological dimension. As such, meaningful quantification of the attributes' contributions to resilience remains a challenge. Our synthesis and holistic framework represent a starting point for critical application of resilience concepts to fisheries social-ecological systems.	adaptive capacity; coastal communities; fisheries management; global change; social-ecological systems; synthesis science	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
91761571	5491	2016.432	Socio-economic Impacts-Coastal Protection	All North Sea countries are confronted by climate change impacts such as accelerated sea-level rise, increasing storm intensities resulting in as well higher set-up of storm surges as growing wave energy and a follow-up of morphological changes. Thus it is necessary to question the effectiveness of existing coastal protection strategies and to examine alternative strategies for coastal protection under a range of scenarios considered possible. Scenarios of accelerating sea-level rise leading to changes in sea level of up to 1 m or more by 2100 and higher set-up of storm surges with increasing wave energy have been used for planning purposes. Adaptation strategies for future coastal protection have been established in all North Sea countries with vulnerable coasts, observing two propositions: (1) structures are economic to construct in the short term and their dimensions easily adapted in the future to ensure flexibility in responding to the as yet undeterminable climate change impacts and (2) implementation of soft measures being temporarily effective and preventing counteraction to natural trends. The coastal protection strategies differ widely from country to country, not only in respect of distinct geographical boundary conditions but also in terms of the length of the planning period and the amount of regulations. Their further development is indispensable and emphasis must more and more be laid on strategies considering the effects of long-term development of coastal processes for future coastal protection. Filling gaps in knowledge is essential for developing sustainable adaptation strategies.

Policy guidance to support community resilience has emerged to mitigate trauma to populations facing disaster and climate change risk, but the guidance itself may be met with mistrust due to historic and recurrent government failures to support traumatized, hurricane-affected communities. The aim of the Community Resilience Learning Collaborative and Research Network study is to address trauma and improve community resilience in response to disaster and climate change-related events in South Louisiana. Key informant interviews from 47 community-based organizations across New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Coastal Louisiana were analyzed and compared with the Key Messages of the 4th National Climate Assessment to determine efficient strategies for building resilience. Community-based organization interviewees emphasized the importance of organizing community-led coalitions and partnerships, implementing trauma-informed care in schools and health care settings, providing infrastructures and educational resources to navigate housing and financial barriers, and creating dialogue to better understand and accept climate change. The strategies revealed in the key informant interviews will be used to design the agency-level coalition-building interventions of Community Resilience Learning Collaborative and Research Network.	community resilience; community-based organizations; disaster preparedness; trauma	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

This paper proposes a method to prioritize locations for stormwater infrastructure. Compared to prior work, it considers both green and grey infrastructure and enables detailed spatial analysis of a community. It uses quantitative measures and includes the multiple potential benefits of green versus grey infrastructure. The method is applied to the coastal county of Chatham County, GA, USA. Results show how the methodology is used to select green or grey infrastructure solutions and highlight locations that should be prioritized for infrastructure investment. Analyses accounting for uncertainties in future climate projections and population estimates are also conducted. The method includes local community characteristics, results in clear placement locations, and with decision-maker input, enables solutions to be adapted as stakeholder priorities evolve to increase community flood resilience.	flood infrastructure; decision-making; infrastructure investment; gis; green infrastructure; grey infrastructure; climate change; community resilience	2023	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761583	6256	2011.259	Assisted Colonization: A Question of Focal Units and Recipient Localities	Assisted colonization as an adaptation strategy to conserve or restore biodiversity in the face of climate change deservedly evokes controversy. Assisted colonization is perceived by some as a last option for conserving endangered species and by others as a risky and unwise management effort due to current gaps of knowledge. Based on the pros and cons of the recent debate, we show that the current discussion mainly focuses on the assisted colonization of rare and endangered species beyond their natural range of distribution. We suggest that a more useful approach for the conservation of endangered species could occur by focusing on the relevant foundation or keystone species, which ensure ecosystem integrity for a multitude of dependent species by governing the habitat structure and microclimate of the site. Examples of foundation species include dominant tree species in forests or dominant corals in coral reefs. For a given conservation or restoration need (e.g. conservation of rare species), we recommend the assisted colonization of pre-adapted ecotypes of the relevant foundation species from climates similar to future expectations for the target site. This approach could lead to climate-safe habitats for endangered species with minimal adverse effects on recipient ecosystems.	adaptation strategy; assisted migration; core species; ecosystem engineers; managed relocation; managed translocation; species conservation	2011	Devi	Laurent	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761585	11350	2022.1566	Exploring the Multiple Benefits of Ecosystem-Based Adaptation in Tourism for Climate Risks and Destination Well-Being	Tourism is strongly interlinked with the natural and social environment, in particular in destinations around the Pacific. These environments are vulnerable to climate change which impacts on the social-ecological system of destinations. Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) uses ecosystems to manage the risks of climate change. However, a gap remains in understanding how the tourism sector can use EbA to create destination-wide benefits. The destination EbA framework presented here aims to address this gap by focusing on well-being and climate risk reduction. The framework is applied to a Pacific case study site, Tanna Island in Vanuatu, by drawing on primary qualitative data. Results highlight that EbA offers an approach for the tourism sector to create holistic benefits to destinations. Several constraints to successful implementation, and how these may be overcome, are identified. The article contributes by providing a framework for other destinations which aim to create benefits through tourism.	ecosystem-based adaptation; tourist destinations; climate change; well-being; social-ecological systems; vanuatu; tanna island	2022	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1

This is the first rigorous, engineering-based, nationwide evaluation of the effectiveness of mangrove habitats as natural defenses. By comparing flood damages for scenarios with and without mangroves, the study estimates the socioeconomic benefits for protecting people and property, to inform conservation and disaster risk reduction policies. Without mangroves, flooding and damages to people, property and infrastructure in the Philippines would increase annually around 25\%. These habitats reduce flooding to 613,500 people/year, 23\% of whom live below the poverty line. They also avert damages to 1 billion US\$/year in residential and industrial property. If mangroves were restored to their 1950 distribution, there would be additional benefits to 267,000 people annually, including 61,500 people below poverty and an additional 453 mill. US\$ in avoided damages. Currently, mangroves prevent more than 1.7 billion US\$ in damages for extreme events (1-in-50-year). Ultimately, rigorous economic estimates of critical ecosystem services like this will help the national government to integrate the value of mangroves to people, into their national accounting systems.	mangroves; the philippines; protection services; expected annual damage; flooding; property damaged	2018	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Their sustainable management in the rapidly changing Arctic is thus a key priority. Fisheries management in complex systems such as the Arctic would benefit from integrative approaches that explicitly seek to build resilience. Yet, resilience is rarely articulated as an explicit goal of Arctic fisheries management. Here, we first describe how marine and anadromous fisheries management throughout the North has used the notion of resilience through a literature review of 72 peer-reviewed articles. Second, we make a conceptual contribution in the form of steps to implement adaptive co-management that aim to foster resilience. Building on resilience-based insights from the literature review and foundational research on adaptive co-management and resilience, the steps we propose are to initiate and carry out (1) dialogue through a discussion forum, (2) place-based social-ecological participatory research, (3) resilience-building management actions, (4) collaborative monitoring, and (5) joint process evaluation. Additionally, we propose action items associated with the steps to put adaptive co-management into practice. Third, we assess two case studies, Cambridge Bay and Pangnirtung Arctic Char commercial fisheries, to explore how the five steps can help reinforce resilience through adaptive co-management. Overall, we propose novel guidelines for implementing adaptive co-management that actively seeks to build resilience within fishery social-ecological systems in times of rapid, uncertain, and complex environmental change.	resilience; learning; inuit; arctic char; fisheries; social-ecological systems; adaptive management	2022	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

On one hand, some of the most severe impacts of climate change are being recorded at the coast - especially through erosion and flooding - whilst on the other hand, these areas represent complex land-sea planning and policy interfaces. This paper analyses the coherency of policies along Ireland's coast from a climate adaptation perspective. Results suggest that many policies are developed in an ad-hoc fashion around the needs of single sectors. Improved policy coherence at all levels of governance is required to address this.	maritime spatial planning; climate adaptation; coasts; policy coherence; ireland	2022	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

Demak Regency that is severely affected by coastal erosion. The coastal erosion in the Timbulsloko Village is mainly caused by the removal of mangrove areas. which has eliminated the function of the natural breakwater for the coast of the Timbulsloko Village. This study aimed to mitigate the coastal erosion in the form of structural and non-structural protection. Structurally (physically), mitigation is conducted by protecting the coastal area with the application of environmentally friendly coastal protection technology in the form of a Permeable breakwater with a Hybrid Engineering structure. Furthermore, the effectiveness of two different structure segments in damping waves from September 2020 - March 2021 will be measured. In contrast, non-structurally, mitigation is conducted in a non-physical way by analyzing the Coastal Vulnerability Index of Timbulsloko Village based on the parameters of Coastal Typology. Average Tidal Range. Significant Wave Height, Coastal Slope, Coastal Geomorphology, Sea Level Rises, and Shoreline Displacement using the CVI method. The effectiveness of the permeable structure's wave damping is determined by the initial wave height and transmission wave height measured by the ultrasonic sensor. On the basis of segment differences, the Permeable Breakwater Segment 2 with a distance between bamboo of 0.25 in has better effectiveness than a Permeable Breakwater Segment 1 with a distance between bamboo of 0.5 m. The results of the Coastal Vulnerability Analysis show that the Timbulsloko Village is vulnerable to coastal disasters. especially coastal erosion.	wave damping; permeable breakwater; coastal erosion; timbulsloko village; coastal vulnerability analysis; coastal vulnerable index	2022	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91761612	6761	2023.141	Interrogating private property rights and path dependencies for coastal retreat	For too long, implicit acceptance of and assumptions about colonial property rights have directed the flow of adaptation policy pathways. Though there is increasing recognition of the challenges that flow from private property rights for effective, long term adaptation planning, there is yet to be sustained and systematic attention to how property rights act as a mechanism that entrenches maladaptive tendencies by further embedding path dependency. This is complicated by law, which on the one hand is thought of as a vehicle to help institutionalise adaptative capacity, but on the other embodies and amplifies property rights. Property discourses are embedding a dominant property rights path dependency for coastal climate adaptation. This path dependency entrenches an incremental approach to coastal governance, with normative ideas on private property rights and the path de-pendencies they create, underpinning managed retreat theory and action. Lessons from case studies in coastal locations in Australia provide important insights into future behaviours of property owners. These insights are useful as coastal management strategies seek to embrace climate change adaptation, and as the financial sector reassesses climate risk exposure.	managed retreat; property rights; path dependencies; climate change adaptation; planned retreat	2023	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91761614	5430	2020.658	A conceptual model-based approach to explore community livelihood adaptation under uncertainty for adaptive delta management	Delta communities worldwide are facing a multitude of challenges in their life and livelihood. In many developing countries, improving the quality of life and livelihood is a key challenge. While development is a central goal of delta planning in such countries, the effectiveness of planning is challenged by uncertain changes in climate and socio-economy. Bangladesh (one of the countries) is moving towards the adaptive delta management approach to deal with such uncertainties. Historical examples illustrate that Community Livelihood Adaptation (CLA) can critically influence the effectiveness of a policy strategy. Therefore, there is a clear need to explore CLA under uncertainty. For that purpose, this paper develops and applies a conceptual model-based approach combining the mental model and scenarios techniques. Our approach starts by using a participatory process to elicit mental models a farmers' community uses when considering adaptation decisions; we capture these in the form of a cognitive map, and this map can serve as a conceptual model for analyzing livelihood adaptation decision-making in a future-oriented scenario analysis. To illustrate the approach, a case study of cropping decision-making of farmers community at a polder location under the saline condition in the southwest of Bangladesh has been elaborated. Results show that the approach is useful in structuring the cognitive and qualitative nature of complex decision-making process, and helps in understanding the dynamic interactions of farmers' adaptation decisions with other actors, their environmental attributes, and market traits. It can help policymakers anticipate the adaptation direction of policy strategies.	uncertainty; community; livelihood; adaptation; adaptive delta management (adm); bangladesh	2020	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

The schema, based on learning gained from the experience of researchers, regulators and industry from the 1990s, is described and assessed by application to 742 saline formation and hydrocarbon field sites, offshore the UK, Norway and The Netherlands. The framework is flexible to accommodate national differences in procedures and practise and the unique character of each site. It is applicable regardless of the timescale of appraisal or scale of assessment. The framework is consistent with and extends the industry commercial project development classification to include categories for sites with a lesser level of data and evaluation. Application to the phases of appraisal of three sites illustrates that investigations may advance understanding by different pathways and rates. The standardised framework enables comparison of the experience of permitting and planning activities completed within different jurisdictions, the level of investment and the duration required to achieve permitted or permit-ready sites. It is intended that the framework of SRLs should be widely applied.	storage readiness levels; co2 storage site maturity	2021	Jean-Pierre	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

It is a phenomenon, however, from which there are few examples to learn. This paper examines relocation processes underway in three low-lying coastal villages in Fiji, each affected by coastal erosion and flooding. Drawing on the concept of ``everyday agency,{'' it considers how environmental changes and planned relocation initiatives are resisted, accommodated, or shaped through daily activities and decision-making. For residents of these three villages, climate change adaptation is not only a matter of adapting to environmental changes, but a process of actively steering a way through unfolding dimensions of planned relocation. The findings respond to increasingly audible calls to recognise the agency of people living in climate-vulnerable places, and to highlight everyday responses to climate impacts and adaptation initiatives.	climate adaptation; fiji; qualitative; relocation; sea-level rise; social navigation	2019	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761634	251970	2022.95	Embedding the value of coastal ecosystem services into climate change adaptation planning	Coastal habitats, such as salt marshes and dune systems, can protect communities from hazards by reducing coastline exposure. However, these critical habitats and their diverse ecosystem services are threatened by coastal development and the impacts from a changing climate. Ever increasing pressure on coastal habitats calls for coastal climate adaptation efforts that mitigate or adapt to these pressures in ways that maintain the integrity of coastal landscapes. An important challenge for decisionmakers is determining the best mitigation and adaptation strategies that not only protect human lives and property, but also safeguard the ability of coastal habitats to provide a broad suite of benefits. Here, we present a potential pathway for local-scale climate change adaptation planning through the identification and mapping of natural habitats that provide the greatest benefits to coastal communities. The methodology coupled a coastal vulnerability model with a climate adaptation policy assessment in an effort to identify priority locations for nature-based solutions that reduce vulnerability of critical assets using feasible land-use policy methods. Our results demonstrate the critical role of natural habitats in providing the ecosystem service of coastal protection in California. We found that specific dune habitats play a key role in reducing erosion and inundation of the coastline and that several wetland areas help to absorb energy from storms and provide a protective service for the coast of Marin county, California, USA. Climate change and adaptation planning are globally relevant issues in which the scalability and transferability of solutions must be considered. This work outlines an iterative approach for climate adaptation planning at a local-scale, with opportunity to consider the scalability of an iterative science-policy engagement approach to regional, national, and international levels.

However, climate change presents significant challenges for Australia's fishing industries, now and into the future. With greater use of targeted information, the fishing industry will be better placed to minimise the negative impacts and take advantage of opportunities associated with the effects of climate change. The future of the fishing industry-specifically wild capture fisheries-will depend on its ability and capacity to apply appropriate adaptation strategies for its viability and sustainability in the long-term. Knowledge regarding expected long-term changes in species distributions, improved weather and seasonal climate forecasts and their influence on target species, and better understanding of species tolerances, can inform adaptation responses. This paper provides a review of recent advances in research addressing Australia's priorities in relation to commercial marine fisheries' responses to current and anticipated future climate change impacts, and considers barriers and adaptation options for fisheries management over the near-term planning horizon of 5-7 years.

91761655	5790	2018.602	Adaptation privilege and Voluntary Buyouts: Perspectives on ethnocentrism in sea level rise relocation and retreat policies in the US	The coast is a highly populated environment that is under increasing risk because of sea level rise (SLR) and climate change. Social science predicts that social and political systems will habitually privilege certain communities and disadvantage others under conditions of risk and disaster. This paper tests that supposition on a particular disaster policy in the United States. Voluntary buyouts are a policy tool in the US that has the potential to help communities adapt to SLR. While buyouts have been resisted in the past, there is some indication that they are becoming more politically popular. Despite increased popularity, communities in Alaska who need to relocate because of repetitive flooding and sea level rise do not meet the basic requirements of the buyout program in a way that makes this policy applicable to their situation. We find that notions of the market, property, and individualism are ideological assumptions inherent to the buyout policies, which ultimately serve to disadvantage tribal communities as they attempt to relocate as an adaptation strategy to climate change. This analysis suggests that adaptation policies to climate change themselves, can limit the inventory of possibilities that some communities have to choose from, and re-entrench inequity in the face of risk.	voluntary buyouts; adaptation; sea level rise; indigenous communities; white privilege	2018	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91761679	7629	2019.822	Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Resilience (Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction) in the Pacific: Opportunities and Challenges in Climate Change Education	Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction in the Pacific led to a high number of informal capacity building workshops where community members were trained on different aspects of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. However, as there were no assessments at the end of the workshops, participants could not build on these certificates to continue to develop their capacities. The European Union Pacific Technical and Vocational Education and Training (EU-PacTVET) project partnered with Fiji Higher Education Commission to develop a process to recognize prior learning acquired during informal workshops. The project focused on how to assess the acquired skills and credit the learners to then complete a resilience qualification. Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) creates opportunities for people who acquired skills during informal workshops or through their personal experience and provides them with credits for a qualification. As a result, it increases their employability, assists in the diversification of their source of income and supports the professionalization of the resilience sector in the Pacific. One major challenge for RPL is the need to build the trust of practitioners and potential employers for the process. Another challenge is to develop fair and robust assessment practices for resilience which is a broad, cross-cutting sector, where skills cannot be directly demonstrated during an assessment session.	technical and vocational training; recognition of prior learning; pacific islands; climate change; resilience	2019	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Further, anthropogenic activities in the coastal zones are accentuating environmental degradation causing widespread suffering. Cyclones and tornadoes in particular damage infrastructures and crops every year affecting the economy of the country negatively. Some naturally adapted plants as well as landscapes usually reduce the speed of cyclones and tornadoes and thus, protect the coastal zones. However, human activities have destroyed many of the forests and landscapes. Sundarbans and Chokoria Sundarbans mangrove forests of Bangladesh are under a great threat of extinction due to illicit logging and agricultural expansion. At least 34 plant species of tropical forest are on the verge of extinction. Many animals e.g., cats, bears, porcupines, wild boars, pythons and anteaters are in the process of being wiped out from the coastal areas. Among the marine and coastal species, Red crabs, jelly-fish, sharks, and dolphins are also rare but these were the major species prior to 1980s. This study revealed that during the recent decades there has been massive plantations and construction of embankment and polderization but these and other measures have been found to be impractical and ineffective in reducing disasters in coastal areas. There is a need for integration of traditional coping practices and wisdoms with modern approaches. Available knowledge on some of these traditional practices has been documented for establishing a sustainable policy for management of coastal zones of Bangladesh. By combining traditional and scientific management of coastal ecosystem with mangroves and other plants following triple-tier mechanism and habitat, it is possible to reduce the effects of natural and climate change-induced disasters. Under such a management system, the entire coastal zone can be made more productive and sustainable. (C). 2015 The Authors.

91761686	13952	2021.1894	Sea Level Rise and Coastal Impacts: Innovation and Improvement of the Local Urban Plan for a Climate-Proof Adaptation Strategy	In recent years, the territorial impacts connected to sea level rise have prompted a reflection on the responsibilities of policy makers in transposing these issues into urban agendas. The need also emerged to both broaden and update the skills of urban planners and to improve territorial governance tools, with the aim of developing feasible regeneration and resilience strategies to face climate change. In this paper, a methodology for the production of Flood Risk Maps is presented, as applied to the Municipality of Ravenna, Italy, by only considering the static component of inundation hazard, i.e., the projected Mean Sea Level Rise, as a first step towards increased preparedness. The resulting Flood Risk Maps represent, in fact, an innovation with respect to the current cognitive framework that supports local urban planning, by providing information on a potential risk that has so far been overlooked. The method combines sea level rise projections under the pessimistic RCP8.5 scenario with georeferenced territorial data, aiming to identify the physical consistency of the urban-structure components which are potentially at risk. For successive time horizons (2030, 2050 and 2100), our results show the progressive impairment and potential degradation of extensive urban areas that are disregarded in the urban planning regulations currently in force. This preliminary evaluation phase is aimed at prompting and supporting the necessary updating of the planning tools and regulations adopted by the public bodies responsible for territorial governance, by identifying priority areas for intervention, and helping define mitigation and adaptation actions.	climate change; sea level rise; coastal flooding; risk; slr projections; urban planning; urban resilience; local urban plan; local adaptation strategy; sustainability	2021	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

However, offshore wind power is not yet competitive with traditional electricity generation technologies, so its sustained development depends on national support policies. Employing a DCF model, this paper scrutinizes how national regulations and geographic conditions of designated national offshore wind development areas affect profitability. The focus of the analysis is on a set of hypothetical offshore wind park scenarios from five countries (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, and the UK). The inclusion of geographic conditions is significant, since water depth and distance to shore influence costs and because available wind resources determine the amount of electricity produced. The paper's findings are threefold: Firstly, profitability results indicate that currently relevant scenarios in the UK and Germany are most attractive, but that the upcoming UK Round III projects have low attractiveness. Belgium, France, and Denmark follow in the rankings successively. Secondly, there is high variation among scenarios with respect to capital costs-differences amount up to +61%. Lastly, a future scenario assuming technology improvements and learning effects suggests that remuneration levels could be lowered by ~25% by 2020.

To prepare for this threat, the Government of Palau is reviewing its marine protected area network to increase the resilience of the reefs by integrating connectivity into the network design. To support their effort, we used high throughput sequencing of microsatellites to create genotypes of colonies of the coral Acropora hyacinthus to characterize population genetic structure and dispersal patterns that led to the recovery of Palau's reefs from a 1998 bleaching event. We found no evidence of a founder effect or refugium where colonies may have survived to recolonize the reef. Instead, we found significant pairwise F'(ST) values, indicating population structure and low connectivity among most of the 25 sites around Palau. We used kinship to measure genetic differences at the individual level among sites and found that differences were best explained by the degree of exposure to the ocean {[}F-1,F-20 = 3.015, Pr(>F) = 0.01], but with little of the total variation explained. A permutation test of the pairwise kinship coefficients revealed that there was self-seeding within sites. Overall, the data point to the population of A. hyacinthus in Palau recovering from a handful of surviving colonies with population growth primarily from self-seeding and little exchange among sites. This finding has significant implications for the management strategies for the reefs of Palau, and we recommend increasing the number and distribution of management areas around Palau to capture the genetic architecture and increase the chances of protecting potential refuges in the future.	microsatellites; connectivity; oceanographic modeling; genetic architecture	2017	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761718	255675	2018.1660	Inter- and intraspecific variation in mangrove carbon fraction and wood specific gravity in Gazi Bay, Kenya	The tropical mangrove ecosystem harbors great potential for carbon offsetting schemes because of their exceptionally high carbon sequestration potential. These cannot only generate an income for local communities by financially compensating for the non-exploitation of protected or replanted stands, but also simultaneously reduce emissions due to forest degradation and deforestation, thereby helping to counteract the global threat on these forests. As carbon is directly monetized through offsetting carbon emissions, accurate species-specific estimation of carbon content in trees is essential and reduces the propagation of errors generated by accounting uncertainties. Accordingly, this study assessed variation in both carbon fraction and wood specific gravity among and within the 10 mangrove species occurring in Gazi Bay, Kenya. Significant interspecific differences were found with values ranging from 45.8% (Avicennia marina) to 49.8% (Ceriops tagal) for carbon fraction and from 0.58 (Sonneratia alba) to 0.93 (Pemphis acidula) for wood specific gravity. The influence of environmental factors (soil salinity, stand density, and elevation a.s.l. as a proxy for multiple interrelated conditions) was investigated, but only elevation a.s.l. appeared to have a species-specific though moderate influence only on carbon fraction. Significant differences in carbon fraction and wood specific gravity were found between stem, aerial roots, and branches of Rhizophora mucronata. In contrast, no significant differences in carbon fraction were found among different stem tissues of A.Â marina, C.Â tagal and R.Â mucronata, the Bay's most abundant species. These results provide insight in carbon content variation, confirming the importance of considering species-specific or even site-specific values of carbon fraction and wood specific gravity, thereby rendering future carbon accounting more accurate.

The sediment stake method was used to measure the elevation changes, whereas the sediment trap method was used to determine sediment accretion and total organic carbon accumulation. Three locations were selected, namely at upstream, middle and downstream the mangrove communities, with each location installed up to 500 m perpendicular to the riverbank. The elevation changes based on sediment stakes were 8.4â€“12.3 mm year-1. Sediment accretion based on sediment traps was 18.5â€“25.4 mm year-1 or 1.88â€“2.98 g cm-2 year-1, while the mean total organic carbon accumulation was 736.8 Â±169 g m-2 year-1. The results are higher than those of similar studies in other regions, but they are consistent with other studies in Papua New Guinea. This study found that higher sediment accretion occurred at the riverbank compared with the interior area, while the elevation changes were greater in the upstream area. Higher relative density and higher basal area had a negative correlation with sediment accretion, but the number of roots had a positive correlation with sedimentation. The high sedimentation in the Kamora Estuary is resulting in the expansion of the mangrove forest at a rate of 3% year-1. Assisted mangrove colonization can be applied to expand the mangrove forest, especially considering the use of Rhizophora species, which this study found to be more effective at trapping sediment Â© 2021, Journal of Ecological Engineering.

91761756	1344	2018.153	Unnatural hypoxic regimes	Coastal hypoxia is increasing worldwide in response to human-caused changes in global climate and biogeochemical cycles. In this paper, we view anthropogenic trends in coastal hypoxia through the lens of disturbance ecology and complexity theory. Complexity theory provides a framework for describing how estuaries and other coastal aquatic ecosystems respond to hypoxia by understanding feedback loops. Can it also be valuable in understanding how these ecosystems behave under shifting (i.e., unnatural) disturbance regimes? When viewed as a disturbance regime, shifts in the spatial (areal extent and fragmentation) and temporal (frequency and duration of events) characteristics of coastal hypoxia can be used to track changes into a non-stationary future. Here, we consider options for increasing the resilience of coastal aquatic ecosystems to future, unnatural hypoxic regimes. To start, we define desirable states as ecosystems with long trophic chains and slow nutrient and carbon dynamics that produce many ecosystem services. We then work backward to describe circumstances dominated by positive feedbacks that can lead ecosystems toward an undesirable state (i.e., depauperate communities and chemically reduced sediments). Processes of degradation and recovery can be understood in the context of island biogeography whereby species diversity in habitats fragmented by hypoxia is determined by the balance between rapid local extinction, slow recolonization from the edges of hypoxic patches, and opportunities for ecological succession during between disturbance events. We review potential future changes associated with changing global climate and highlight ways to enhance coastal resilience. In addition to efforts to slow climate change, potential interventions include reduced nutrient and carbon loadings from rivers, restoration of aquatic vegetation, and managing for key species, including those that promote sediment oxygenation, that enhance water clarity, or that promote grazing on epiphytic algae through top-down control.	acidification, positive feedbacks; aquatic vegetation, trophic cascade; climate change disturbance; hypoxia; regime shift; resilience; thresholds; tipping points	2018	Jean-Pierre	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761762	13696	2011.594	Policy solutions in the U.S.	The paper focuses on relocation, retreat, zoning, insurance, and subsidy as major dimensions of coastal hazard mitigation measures that have resurfaced as potent forces for combating coastal inundation and climate change. It reviews the issues surrounding the practice of these measures and discusses compatibilities of policies, engineering measures, and natural defense. Property rights, development interest, and distorted financial incentives pose as main barriers to coastal relocation and retreat policies in hazard-prone areas. To understand and propose coastal adaptation solutions, the paper recommends place-based studies of local coastal adaptation strategies. Place-based studies offer an in-depth knowledge of local conditions specifically regarding the level of implementation of hazard mitigation policies, and shed light on important trade-offs and synergies of various hazard policies. In addition, coupling existing hazard mitigation policies with coastal management and community management can better inform long-term and comprehensive planning of coastal adaptation.

91761768	13512	2022.1873	A review of adaptation options in fisheries management to support resilience and transition under socio-ecological change	Social-ecological systems dependent on fisheries must be resilient or adapt to remain viable in the face of change. Here, we identified possible interventions (termed ``adaptation options{''}) from published literature, aimed at supporting social or ecological resilience and/or aiding adaptation to changes induced by environmental or social stressors. Our searches centered on nations/regions across North America, Europe, and the South Pacific, encompassing fisheries literature with and without a climate change focus, to compare how, when, and by whom interventions are currently or potentially implemented. We expected that adaptation options within a climate change context would have a greater focus on enhancing social resilience due to a connection with climate change adaptation assessment methodology. Instead, we found a greater focus on ecological resilience, likely indicating a focus on management adaptation. This pattern, along with the more extensive use of social adaptation options responsively and outside the context of climate change, along with an importance in bottom-up influences in implementing them, suggests a general lack of centralized planning and organization with regards to adaptation of stakeholders. Determining how adaptation options are created, chosen, and implemented is a crucial step within or external to ecosystem-based management, especially if planned stakeholder adaption is the goal.	adaptation; adaptation option; climate change; fisheries governance; fisheries management; integrated assessment; planned adaptation	2022	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761772	2078	2021.295	Incorporating putatively neutral and adaptive genomic data into marine conservation planning	The availability of genomic data for an increasing number of species makes it possible to incorporate evolutionary processes into conservation plans. Recent studies show how genetic data can inform spatial conservation prioritization (SCP), but they focus on metrics of diversity and distinctness derived primarily from neutral genetic data sets. Identifying adaptive genetic markers can provide important information regarding the capacity for populations to adapt to environmental change. Yet, the effect of including metrics based on adaptive genomic data into SCP in comparison to more widely used neutral genetic metrics has not been explored. We used existing genomic data on a commercially exploited species, the giant California sea cucumber (Parastichopus californicus), to perform SCP for the coastal region of British Columbia (BC), Canada. Using a RAD-seq data set for 717P. californicusindividuals across 24 sampling locations, we identified putatively adaptive (i.e., candidate) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on genotype-environment associations with seafloor temperature. We calculated various metrics for both neutral and candidate SNPs and compared SCP outcomes with independent metrics and combinations of metrics. Priority areas varied depending on whether neutral or candidate SNPs were used and on the specific metric used. For example, targeting sites with a high frequency of warm-temperature-associated alleles to support persistence under future warming prioritized areas in the southern coastal region. In contrast, targeting sites with high expected heterozygosity at candidate loci to support persistence under future environmental uncertainty prioritized areas in the north. When combining metrics, all scenarios generated intermediate solutions, protecting sites that span latitudinal and thermal gradients. Our results demonstrate that distinguishing between neutral and adaptive markers can affect conservation solutions and emphasize the importance of defining objectives when choosing among various genomic metrics for SCP.	adaptive genetic variation; climate change; conservation genetics; marine protected area; spatial conservation prioritization; area marina protegida; cambio climatico; genetica de la conservacion; priorizacion de la conservacion espacial; variacion genetica adaptativa	2021	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

These changes pose serious threats to the millions of people that live by the coast. Thus, the objective of the present review is to discuss how climate change is altering (and will continue to alter) atmospheric and oceanic processes, what are the main implications of these alterations along the coastline, and which are the ecosystem-based management (EBM) strategies that have been proposed and applied to address these issues. While ocean warming, ocean acidification and increasing sea level have been more extensively studied, investigations on the effects of climate change to wind and wave climates are less frequent. Coastal ecosystems and their respective natural resources will respond differently according to location, environmental drivers and coastal processes. EBM strategies have mostly concentrated on improving ecosystem services, which can be used to assist in mitigating climate change effects. The main challenge for developing nations regards gaps in information and scarcity of resources. Thus, for effective management and adaptive EBM strategies to be developed worldwide, information at a local level is greatly needed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

91761782	738	2010.35	Climate change effects: the intersection of science, policy, and resource management in the USA	Perhaps no subject is more intriguing and complex than climate change and its effects on ecosystems and their biological communities. Changes in precipitation and snowmelt patterns, sea level rise, increased intensity of storms and wet-weather events, thawing permafrost, changes in vegetation and wildlife composition and distribution, and other effects present significant policy and land management challenges. Scientific modeling and analyses demonstrate that the effects of a changing climate are complex, with high variability over time, space, and species, including effects on benthic organisms. The variable effects of a changing climate complicate decision making, rendering scenario planning, adaptive management, and other management learning tools increasingly important. The very complexity of effects presents particularly difficult challenges for policy makers and resource managers because the available science often is highly uncertain. Thus, other decision support tools are needed to help managers anticipate and respond to local and regional conditions. Effective policy and management require relevant science to inform decision making. Key needs include more assessments of ecosystem and species trends and their possible linkage to climate change and a better understanding of the interplay of multiple variables, how different management regimes might affect ecosystems and species survival, and how to apply risk management tools and adaptive management to resource issues.	climate change; climate adaptation; resource management	2010	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

While much research has been published on disaster response and recovery for specific climate-related hazards in the region, such as cyclones, floods and droughts, there is a growing need for insight into how communities respond, recover and adapt to the multiple, intersecting risks posed by environmental, societal and economic change. This chapter frames the body of new research presented in this book from the perspective of multi-risk environments, paying particular attention to concepts central to the disaster response and recovery cycle, and rejecting the notion of a distinct boundary between climate and society. Further, this introductory chapter foregrounds the importance of cultural values, power relations, Indigenous knowledge systems, local networks and community-based adaptive capacities when considering resilience, recovery and adaptation to climate-induced disasters at the community and household level. Overviews of the research presented in this book demonstrate a diverse range of responses and adaptive strategies at the local level in case studies from Solomon Islands, Fiji, Cambodia and Samoa, as well as implications for policy, planning and management.	disaster; hazard; climate change adaptation; resilience; southeast asia; pacific islands	2021	Jean-Pierre	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

The primary technical challenge of artificial upwelling is devising site-specific strategies to retain as much of the nutrients contained in deep ocean water at higher concentrations than the background for as long as possible in the photic zone. Recent experiments and analyses have helped to move the concept forward, but substantial work remains to be undertaken.

Yet, as sea levels are projected to rise, relocating is an inevitable response for vulnerable coastal communities worldwide. In fact, some Fijian villages are facing such severe coastal erosion that they have already begun the process of shifting to higher ground, and many more villages throughout the islands have been slated for relocation. This case study is based on the planned relocation efforts of Narikoso village on Ono Island in Kadavu, Fiji. In Narikoso, regional NGOs, INGOs, and local and national government are working with the community to relocate the village inland. The process of moving the community began in 2012 when Prime Minister Bainimarama sent the Fiji military to Ono Island to clear land for the new village. It came to an abrupt stop due to a lack of funding and ecological degradation caused by the preparation for the new village site. Since the relocation process began, a myriad of issues have arisen ranging from concerns regarding community engagement, availability of financial resources, and resistance to moving inland.

91761794	5616	2022.807	The Promise of Blue Carbon Climate Solutions: Where the Science Supports Ocean-Climate Policy	The ocean is gaining prominence in climate change policy circles as a tool for addressing the climate crisis. Blue carbon, the carbon captured and stored by marine and coastal ecosystems and species, offers potential as a ``nature-based solution{''} to climate change. The protection and restoration of specific ocean ecosystems can form part of a climate response within climate mitigation policies such as Nationally Determined Contributions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. For mitigation policies that seek to implement management actions that drawdown carbon, ecosystem sequestration and emissions must be measurable across temporal and spatial scales, and management must be practical leading to improved sequestration and avoided emissions. However, some blue carbon interventions may not be suitable as a climate mitigation response and better suited for other policy instruments such as those targeted toward biodiversity conservation. This paper gives context to numerous blue carbon sequestration pathways, quantifying their potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere, and comparing these sequestration pathways to point-source emissions reductions. The applicability of blue carbon is then discussed in terms of multiple international policy frameworks, to help individuals and institutions utilize the appropriate framework to reach ocean conservation and climate mitigation goals.	blue carbon; climate change; coastal wetlands; mitigation; nature-based solution; carbon sequestration; additionality	2022	Jean-Pierre	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Yet fine-scale estimates of seagrass carbon stocks, fluxes from anthropogenic disturbances, and potential gains in sedimentary carbon from seagrass restoration are lacking for most of the Western Hemisphere. To begin to fill this knowledge gap in the subtropics and tropics, we quantified organic carbon (Corg) stocks, losses, and gains from restorations at 8 previously-disturbed seagrass sites around the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) (nÂ =Â 128 cores). Mean natural seagrass Corg stocks were 25.7Â Â±Â 6.7Â MgÂ CorgÂ haâˆ’Â 1 around the GoM, while mean Corg stocks at adjacent barren sites that had previously hosted seagrass were 17.8Â MgÂ CorgÂ haâˆ’Â 1. Restored seagrass beds contained a mean of 38.7Â Â±Â 13.1Â MgÂ CorgÂ haâˆ’Â 1. Mean Corg losses differed by anthropogenic impact type, but averaged 20.98Â Â±Â 7.14Â MgÂ CorgÂ haâˆ’Â 1. Corg gains from seagrass restoration averaged 20.96Â Â±Â 8.59Â MgÂ haâˆ’Â 1. These results, when combined with the similarity between natural and restored Corg content, highlight the potential of seagrass restoration for mitigating seagrass Corg losses from prior impact events. Our GoM basin-wide estimates of natural Corg totaled ~Â 36.4Â Tg for the 947,327Â ha for the USA-GoM. Including Mexico, the total basin contained an estimated 37.2â€“37.5Â Tg Corg. Regional US-GoM losses totaled 21.69Â Tg Corg. Corg losses differed significantly among anthropogenic impacts. Yet, seagrass restoration appears to be an important climate change mitigation strategy that could be implemented elsewhere throughout the tropics and subtropics.

91761800	7220	2021.933	Large-scale shift in the structure of a kelp forest ecosystem co-occurs with an epizootic and marine heatwave	Climate change is responsible for increased frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme events, such as marine heatwaves (MHWs). Within eastern boundary current systems, MHWs have profound impacts on temperature-nutrient dynamics that drive primary productivity. Bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana) forests, a vital nearshore habitat, experienced unprecedented losses along 350km of coastline in northern California beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2019. These losses have had devastating consequences to northern California communities, economies, and fisheries. Using a suite of in situ and satellite-derived data, we demonstrate that the abrupt ecosystem shift initiated by a multi-year MHW was preceded by declines in keystone predator population densities. We show strong evidence that northern California kelp forests, while temporally dynamic, were historically resilient to fluctuating environmental conditions, even in the absence of key top predators, but that a series of coupled environmental and biological shifts between 2014 and 2016 resulted in the formation of a persistent, altered ecosystem state with low primary productivity. Based on our findings, we recommend the implementation of ecosystem-based and adaptive management strategies, such as (1) monitoring the status of key ecosystem attributes: kelp distribution and abundance, and densities of sea urchins and their predators, (2) developing management responses to threshold levels of these attributes, and (3) creating quantitative restoration suitability indices for informing kelp restoration efforts. Meredith McPherson et al. use a 34-year time series of satellite and in situ derived data to study bull kelp forests of northern California and demonstrate the ecosystem shifts following a marine heatwave event between 2014 and 2016. The results show that increased herbivory by sea urchins due to the loss of a predator reduced bull kelp forest resistance to fluctuating environmental conditions and point to the importance of ecosystem-based and adaptive management strategies.

Sea-level rise is expected to exacerbate coastal erosion. Adaptation measures in response to this in SIDS have the potential to reduce some of the adverse impacts, yet they have limitations. This article addresses the degree to which households on the island of Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), are affected by coastal erosion, the autonomous adaptation measures they have implemented, the limitations thereof, and the loss and damage incurred as a result. This analysis is based on quantitative and qualitative data. We found that 70\% of the 363 households we interviewed experienced adverse effects of coastal erosion. Of those suffering from impacts, 60\% carried out adaptation measures. Yet, 92\% of those respondents who carried out adaptation measures indicated that these measures were insufficient, resulting in loss and damage to livelihoods, housing and culture. This empirical case study contributes to the critical debate on the impacts of climate change beyond adaptation.	loss and damage; climate change; limits to adaptation; slow-onset changes; kosrae; micronesia; pacific ocean; coastal erosion; vulnerability; small-island developing states; sids	2013	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761809	1914	2020.250	The Blue Fix: What's driving blue growth?	This article explores the politics behind the promise of `blue growth'. Reframing it as a `blue fix', we argue that the blue growth discourse facilitates new opportunities for capital accumulation, while claiming that this accumulation is compatible with social and ecological aims as well. The blue fix is made up of three underlying sub-fixes. First of all, the conservation fix quenches the social thirst for action in the face of climate change. Here we see how protecting marine areas can be an important part of mitigating climate change, but in practice, gains at the national level are overshadowed by the ongoing expansion of offshore drilling for oil and gas. Second, the protein fix satisfies the growing global demand for healthy food and nutrition through the expansion of capital-intensive large-scale aquaculture, while ignoring the negative socio-ecological impacts, which effectively squeeze small-scale capture fishing out, while industrial capture fishing remains well positioned to expand into as well as supply industrial aquaculture with fish feed from pelagic fish. And third, an energy fix offers a burst of wind energy and a splash of new deep-sea minerals without disturbing the familiar and persistent foundation of oil and gas. This dimension of the blue fix emphasizes the transition to wind and solar energy, but meanwhile the deep sea mining for minerals required by these new technologies launches us into unknown ecological territories with little understood consequences. The synergy of these three elements brought together in a reframing of ocean politics manifests as a balancing act to frame blue growth as `sustainable' and in everyone's interest, which we critically analyze and discuss in this article.	blue growth; blue economy; marine protected areas; aquaculture; oil and gas; deep sea mining	2020	Devi	NA	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1

It was estimated, in this respect, that global average sea level rose, during the 20th Century, by at least 10 cm. This trend is expected to continue and most likely accelerated during the 21st Century due to human-induced global warming. Global average sea level is expected to rise, by the year 2100, due to global warming between 0.18 and 0.59 cm. Such a rise in sea-level will significantly impact coastal areas due to the high concentration of natural and socioeconomic activities and assets located along the coast. The northern coastal zone of the Nile Delta is generally low land, and is consequently vulnerable to direct and indirect impacts of sea level rise (SLR) due to climate changes, particularly inundation. Despite the uncertainty associated with developed scenarios for climate change and expected SLR, there is a need, according to precautionary approach, to assess and analyze the impacts of SLR. Such an assessment, on one hand, can assist in formulating effective adaptation options to specific, sometimes localized, impacts of SLR. On the other hand, such an analysis can contribute significantly to the development of integrated approach to deal with the impacts of SLR. The objective of this paper is to assess and spatially analyze the risks of expected sea level rise (SLR), in particular inundation, and its implications up to the year 2100 in Kafr El Sheikh Governorate, Egypt, using GIS techniques. For that purpose, a GIS was developed for the study area and then utilized to identify the spatial extent of those areas that would be vulnerable to inundation by SLR. Moreover, various land uses/land covers susceptible to such inundation were identified. Results indicate that more than 22.59 \% and 24.50 \% of the total area of Kafr El Sheikh Governorate would be vulnerable to inundation under B1 and A1FI (IPCC most optimistic and pessimistic scenarios), respectively. No significant difference was noticed between the two scenarios in terms of spatial extent of SLR impacts. It was also found that a significant proportion of these areas were found to be currently either undeveloped or wetlands. Moreover, it was found that about 90.13 \% of the vulnerable areas are actually less exposed to the risks of SLR due to the existence of a number of man-made features, not intended as protection measures, e.g. International Coastal Highway, that can be used to limit the areas vulnerable to inundations by SLR.	inundation; sea level rise; gis	2013	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761812	2565	2018.270	The Wadden Sea: A natural landscape outside the dikes	The Wadden Sea of today is largely a natural landscape, one of the last of its kind in Western Europe. This is the case because natural forces in the Wadden Sea are so strong that the area could not be transformed into a cultural landscape before the protection of nature became an important asset for our society about 4o years ago. Consequently, the guiding principle for the protection of the entire Wadden Sea area, which was decided upon by the three Wadden Sea countries as early as 1991, is `to achieve, as far as possible, a natural and sustainable ecosystem in which natural processes proceed in an undisturbed way'. The protection of the Wadden Sea is strongly linked to this guiding principle, and this is also what the inscription of the Wadden Sea as a World Heritage Site in 2009 is based upon. There is a rather clear spatial segregation between the natural landscape and the cultural landscape by the dikes, the cultural landscape usually being on the landward side. However, some of the cultural landscapes, e.g. old grasslands, are also very rich in natural values. Moreover, important cultural values can also be found within the natural landscape of the Wadden Sea. The author calls for a focus on better cooperation between the sectors of nature and culture, as both face important challenges. These include the protection of old grasslands and, in particular, climate change. The latter entails the necessity to implement renewable energy production in a way that allows natural and cultural values to remain protected and to develop measures for climate adaptation to allow the Wadden Sea to grow with the sea level. The author argues that more flexibility in finding new ways to deal with water would help to better adapt to the coming sea level rise in the cultural landscape. `rhe extension of the Wadden Sea biosphere reserves with transition areas, as is being discussed and partly implemented in Germany, could be a good approach to improve the protection of cultural values in the Wadden Sea region.	wadden sea; conservation; natural landscape; cultural landscape; climate adaptation	2018	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761817	13236	2015.897	Joint effects of storm surge and sea-level rise on US Coasts: new economic estimates of impacts, adaptation, and benefits of mitigation policy	Recent literature, the US Global Change Research Program's National Climate Assessment, and recent events, such as Hurricane Sandy, highlight the need to take better account of both storm surge and sea-level rise (SLR) in assessing coastal risks of climate change. This study combines three models-a tropical cyclone simulation model; a storm surge model; and a model for economic impact and adaptation-to estimate the joint effects of storm surge and SLR for the US coast through 2100. The model is tested using multiple SLR scenarios, including those incorporating estimates of dynamic ice-sheet melting, two global greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policy scenarios, and multiple general circulation model climate sensitivities. The results illustrate that a large area of coastal land and property is at risk of damage from storm surge today; that land area and economic value at risk expands over time as seas rise and as storms become more intense; that adaptation is a cost-effective response to this risk, but residual impacts remain after adaptation measures are in place; that incorporating site-specific episodic storm surge increases national damage estimates by a factor of two relative to SLR-only estimates, with greater impact on the East and Gulf coasts; and that mitigation of GHGs contributes to significant lessening of damages. For a mid-range climate-sensitivity scenario that incorporates dynamic ice sheet melting, the approach yields national estimates of the impacts of storm surge and SLR of \$990 billion through 2100 (net of adaptation, cumulative undiscounted 2005\$); GHG mitigation policy reduces the impacts of the mid-range climate-sensitivity estimates by \$84 to \$100 billion.

91761818	185770	2010.5855	THE ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF TEMPERATE MANGROVES	Previous reviews of mangrove biology focused on the more extensive and diverse tropical examples, with those of temperate regions generally relegated to a footnote. Temperate mangroves are distinctive in several ways, most obviously by the lower diversity of tree species. Their occurrence in relatively developed countries has created different issues for mangrove management from those in the tropics. Mangroves in several temperate areas are currently expanding, due to changes in river catchments, in contrast to their worldwide decline. Information derived from the greater body of research from tropical regions has sometimes been applied uncritically to the management of temperate mangroves. The growing body of information on the ecology of temperate mangroves is reviewed, with emphasis on productivity, response to anthropogenically enhanced rates of sediment accumulation, and potential effects of climate change. There is no unique marine or estuarine fauna in temperate mangroves, but the poorly known terrestrial fauna includes mangrove-dependent species. Although productivity generally declines with increasing latitude, there is overlap in the range of reported values between temperate and tropical regions and considerable within-region variation. This, and variation in other ecologically important factors, makes it advisable to consider management of temperate mangroves on a case-by-case basis, for example, when responding to expansion of mangroves at a particular location.

91761826	546	2013.38	Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change: A New Zealand story.	The requirement for using a participatory approach to consider options for adapting to climate change is well documented, but there are some key challenges of engaging with communities, especially over the complexities of projected climate change impacts and possible adaptation options. Here we describe the development of a two-stage method aimed to overcome these challenges, and the testing of this method in a coastal community in Whitianga on the Coromandel Peninsula, North Island of New Zealand. First, at an Open Day we used projections of sea-level rise driven changes to coastal inundation, erosion and habitat change and mapped them on large aerial-photo maps to use as the basis for a participatory mapping exercise. The purpose of the Open Day was to elicit input on valued aspects of the Whitianga community that might be at threat from climate change. Second, at a follow-up Workshop we worked with the community to explore the potential for adaptation options to provide `solutions' to these issues, exploring who the winners and losers would be for each option, and what would be required to enable the options to be actioned. The maps were a key tool in this engagement case-study, and we reflect on them in our discussion of their development and usefulness. Finally we summarise the lessons learned in this case study and describe four key inputs to successful community engagement: the right team, the right data, the right support, and the right resources.	participatory mapping; climate change impacts; sea-level rise; adaptation	2013	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761832	2656	2016.214	Scaling up bioethanol production from the farmed brown macroalga Macrocystis pyrifera in Chile	Interest in third-generation biomass such as macroalgae has increased due to their high biomass yield, absence of lignin in their tissues, lower competition for land and fresh water, no fertilization requirements, and efficient CO2 capture in coastal ecosystems. However, several challenges still exist in the development of cost-effective technologies for processing large amounts of macroalgae. Recently, genetically modified micro-organisms able to convert brown macroalgae carbohydrates into bioethanol were developed, but still no attempt to scale up production has been proposed. Based on a giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) farming and bioethanol production program carried out in Chile, we were able to test and adapt this technology as a first attempt to scale up this process using a 75 L fermentation of genetically modified Escherichia coli. Laboratory fermentation tests results showed that although biomass growth and yield are not greatly affected by the alginate:mannitol ratio, ethanol yield showed a clear maximum around a 5:8 alginate:mannitol ratio. In M. pyrifera, a much greater proportion of alginate and lower mannitol abundance is found. In order to make the most of the carbohydrates available for fermentation, we developed a four-stage process model for scaling up, including acid leaching, depolymerization, saccharification, and fermentation steps. Using this process, we obtained 0.213 Kg ethanol Kg(-1) dry macroalgae, equivalent to 9.6 m(3) of ethanol hectare(-1) year(-1), reaching 64\% of the maximum theoretical ethanol yield. We propose strategies to increase this yield, including synthetic biology pathway engineering approaches and process optimization targets.

The sustainable development and food security of islands in the Asia-Pacific region is severely compromised by climate change, sea level rise and compounding socio-economic issues. To achieve a step-change in food production and climate adaptation, livelihoods must rapidly transform. Food security programs continue to apply the ``pipeline{'' model of scaling-out technological innovations, but do not account for the social-ecological complexity of islands. We tested the feasibility of scaling-out adaptation strategies in two provinces in the region: Nusa Tenggara Barat in Indonesia, and West New Britain in Papua New Guinea. Guided by a sub-district typology of resource use, we trialled a participatory, systems-based livelihood adaptation pathways approach in sub-district case studies. The process aimed to mainstream social learning and future uncertainty into community development decision-making, yielding `no regrets' adaptation strategies to transform livelihoods. We tested two assumptions: first, that because the contexts of all villages were homogenous, strategies were sufficiently similar to enable scaling-out across the provinces; second, that the sub-district typologies would assist scaling-out within each type. The results showed that the first assumption was untenable: there was very little similarity amongst villages' strategies; only sustainable fisheries management was scalable amongst coastal villages. The second was marginally tenable, because there were strong similarities amongst villages in an off-shore island type. When pooled into classes of adaptation strategy, most related to practice and behaviour change, and addressed systemic social issues; very few were technological. Our results suggest that scaling-out livelihood and food system innovations is not feasible due to the complex social-ecological contexts within islands, caused by steep climate gradients, natural resource and cultural diversity. We discuss the limitations of a resource use typology that aimed to mitigate this complexity and guide scaling-out. Instead we argue that appropriate social learning approaches akin to livelihood adaptation pathways must be mainstreamed into existing community development decision cycles, thereby ``scaling-up{''} and ``scaling-deep{''} to tackle institutional, political and cultural barriers to transformation. We discuss the implications of our recommendations for government and donor support for food security programs in islands of the Asia-Pacific region, and future research priorities.	adaptation pathways; food security; indonesia; islands; livelihoods; papua new guinea; scaling-deep; scaling-up	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761836	5293	2016.415	Methodology to assess coastal infrastructure resilience to climate change	The section of railway which runs along the coastline of south Devon in United Kingdom, from Exeter to Newton Abbot, is one of the most photographed sections of railway in the world. It was opened in 1846 with embankments and seawalls protecting and supporting the railway, providing the route of an atmospheric railway. Despite regular maintenance however, there has been a history of storm damage, one of the most severe occurring in February 2014. This resulted in the collapse of the line, interruption of all rail traffic into and out of the far SouthWest of the United Kingdom (affecting parts of Devon and the whole of Cornwall) and significant damage to the region's economy. In order to improve the resilience of the line, several options have been considered to evaluate and reduce climate change impacts to the railway. This paper describes the methodological approach developed to evaluate the risks of flooding for a range of scenarios in the estuary and open coast reaches of the line. Components to derive the present day and future climate change coastal conditions including some possible adaptation measures are also presented together with the results of the hindcasting analysis to assess the performance of the modelling system. An overview of the modelling results obtained to support the development of a long-term Resilience Strategy for asset management is also discussed.

91761842	2231	2021.320	Summer Is Coming! Tackling Ocean Warming in Atlantic Salmon Cage Farming	Simple Summary Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) has become a commodity worldwide. The culture of Atlantic salmon is by far the most well-developed branch of marine finfish aquaculture, with this species ranking among the top ten most highly produced in global aquaculture. While Atlantic salmon has been commonly farmed in sea cages located in colder waters (e.g., in Norway, Chile and Tasmania), these regions can experience the negative impacts of heat waves that push seawater temperature above values tolerated by this species. These climate-change-driven shifts in water temperature can be associated with mass mortality events and urgent actions are needed to cope with a changing ocean. This paper reviews the thermal limits of adult Atlantic salmon and lists the negative effects driven by heat stress. We highlight how biotechnology and the genetic diversity of wild populations may help producers to tackle this challenge. Selective breeding programs and other more advanced biotechnological solutions (e.g., gene editing) may play a key role in this quest to produce new strains of Atlantic salmon that more readily tolerate higher water temperatures, without compromising productivity and profitability. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) cage farming has traditionally been located at higher latitudes where cold seawater temperatures favor this practice. However, these regions can be impacted by ocean warming and heat waves that push seawater temperature beyond the thermo-tolerance limits of this species. As more mass mortality events are reported every year due to abnormal sea temperatures, the Atlantic salmon cage aquaculture industry acknowledges the need to adapt to a changing ocean. This paper reviews adult Atlantic salmon thermal tolerance limits, as well as the deleterious eco-physiological consequences of heat stress, with emphasis on how it negatively affects sea cage aquaculture production cycles. Biotechnological solutions targeting the phenotypic plasticity of Atlantic salmon and its genetic diversity, particularly that of its southernmost populations at the limit of its natural zoogeographic distribution, are discussed. Some of these solutions include selective breeding programs, which may play a key role in this quest for a more thermo-tolerant strain of Atlantic salmon that may help the cage aquaculture industry to adapt to climate uncertainties more rapidly, without compromising profitability. Omics technologies and precision breeding, along with cryopreservation breakthroughs, are also part of the available toolbox that includes other solutions that can allow cage farmers to continue to produce Atlantic salmon in the warmer waters of the oceans of tomorrow.	climate change; heat stress; phenotypic plasticity; salmo salar; thermal tolerance	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
91761849	6294	2015.421	Addressing fisheries bycatch in a changing world	Fisheries bycatch is a threat to species of marine megafauna across the world's oceans. Work over the past several decades has greatly advanced our understanding of the species affected, the magnitude and the spatial extent of bycatch. In the same time period, there have been substantial advances in the development of mitigation strategies and best practices to reduce bycatch. In this paper, we take stock of bycatch knowledge and science to address the critical question ``Where do we go from here?{'' First, we review the current state of global bycatch science, including bycatch rate estimation and biological effects of bycatch, and bycatch mitigation practices and gear. We then identify knowledge gaps as well as socio-cultural constraints that hamper effective knowledge transfer or implementation, and discuss emerging transdisciplinary approaches to address these issues. Finally, we discuss the need to consider bycatch in a changing ocean and socio-cultural context where species, ecosystems, and people are responding to multiple stressors and dynamic conditions. As the field of bycatch research moves into the twenty-first century, a new perspective is needed to develop responsive strategies that effectively address the shifting ecological, social, cultural, and economic contexts of the global bycatch seascape.	marine megafauna; bycatch; social-ecological systems; marine conservation; sustainable fisheries; global change	2015	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
91761852	299285	2021.2228	Microgrid and Fleet to Grid Operation of a Hybrid Electric Ferry	The onboard renewable energy based hybrid electric ferry, which is an isolated marine microgrid can be an alternative for the conventional fossil fuel based marine microgrid in reducing greenhouse gas emission. The onboard energy storage of a marine microgrid can be utilized as FCAS (frequency control ancillary service) by regulating system voltage and frequency of shore side local grid. Like V2G (vehicle to grid), F2G (ferry to grid) can also support the local grid by feeding electricity from storage devices during peak demand when the electric ferry or vessel is at berth. In this paper, two simulated models are designed using MATLABÂ®/SIMULINKÂ® for analyzing the system parameters like voltage, current and power at different sections of marine microgrid as well as for grid interactive F2G operation. In simulated model of hybrid ZED (zonal electrical distribution), the AC and DC loads of 28.32 kW and 775.7 W respectively consume electricity mainly from lithium-ion battery of 100 Ah, 300V, Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) of 50 kW, 625 V and 1-kW PV solar system whereas 5 kVA diesel generator acts as backup source. In simulated model of F2G operation, the coordinated charging of 4 MW BESSs (Battery Energy Storage Systems) of 40 electric vessels at berth provides FCAS. The maximum electricity consumption by 13 MW load (BESS and residential and industrial load) matches with the maximum electricity generation by steam turbine generator, wind park and solar PV farm of 15 MW, 4.5 MW and 8 MW respectively of SSP (shore side power) at that instant. The simulation results give an overview of applicability of hybrid marine microgrid with F2G operation of electric vessel.

In this study, we investigated how stakeholders from important Blue Economy sectors along the German North Sea coast perceive the impacts of climate change on their daily work life and the growth of the Blue Economy. In a two-stage approach we first conducted two stakeholder workshops with representatives from the regional sea food sector, science, NGOs and local authorities, in order to identify important issues linked to climate change affecting environment, society, economy and policy. In the second stage, we conducted semi-structured interviews with key knowledge holders from the Blue Economy, to evaluate and validate the most important issues identified during the first stage, and the impacts on the respective sectors. The workshop participants identified perceptible effects of climate change on their marine environment. Early career scientists showed that they possess a clear focus on measures for climate change adaptation, transdisciplinary approaches and knowledge transfer. The interviews revealed that the climate change effects could be perceived as both negative and positive, depending on the sector. Other issues, especially political decisions and developments are perceived to have a greater immediate impact on the Blue Economy than the slow progress of climate change effects. Additionally, increased human activities, in the form of new or intensified uses like marine renewable energy generation, have a greater influence and lead to conflicts between the Blue Economy sectors. Our study showed that economic and societal stakeholders in Germanys North Sea region are aware of climate change and already perceive its effects on their businesses. Synergies and conflicts between the sectors and political decisions might influence sustainable growth of the Blue Economy in highly contested regions, such as the North Sea basin, much stronger than the effects of climate change. This calls for a more flexible and adaptive approach to policymaking, taking into account the changing environmental, social and economic realities.	adaptation; fisheries; tourism; north sea; aquaculture; blue growth; saefood	2020	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761872	326472	2022.274	Convergence of emerging technologies: Development of a risk-based paradigm for marine mammal monitoring for offshore wind energy operations	The ability to gather real-time and near real-time data on marine mammal distribution, movement, and habitat use has advanced significantly over the past two decades. These advances have outpaced their adoption into a meaningful, risk-based assessment framework so critically needed to support society's growing demands for a transition to increased reliance on renewable energy. Marine acoustics have the capacity to detect, identify, and locate vocalizations over broad areas. Photogrammetric and image processing increases the ability to visually detect animals from surface or aerial platforms. Ecological models based on long-term observational data coupled with static and remotely sensed oceanographic data are able to predict daily and seasonal habitat suitability. Extensive monitoring around anthropogenic activities, combined with controlled experiments of exposure parameters (i.e., sound), supports better informed decisions on reducing effects. Population models and potential consequence modeling provide the ability to estimate the significance of individual and population exposure. The collective capacities of these emerging technical approaches support a risk ranking and risk management approach to monitoring and mitigating effects on marine mammals related to development activities. The monitoring paradigm related to many offshore energy-related activities, however, has long been spatially limited, situationally myopic, and operationally uncertain. A case evaluation process is used to define and demonstrate the changing paradigm of effective monitoring aimed at protecting living resources and concurrently providing increased certainty that essential activities can proceed efficiently. Recent advances in both technologies and operational approaches are examined to delineate a risk-based paradigm, driven by a diversity of regional data inputs, that is capable of meeting the imperative for timely development of offshore wind energy.

91761880	306363	2019.463	Building the Knowledge-to-Action Pipeline in North America: Connecting Ocean Acidification Research and Actionable Decision Support	Ocean acidification (OA) describes the progressive decrease in the pH of seawater and other cascading chemical changes resulting from oceanic uptake of atmospheric carbon. These changes can have important implications for marine ecosystems, creating risk for commercial industries, subsistence communities, cultural practices, and recreation. Characterizing the extent of acidification and predicting the ramifications for marine and freshwater resources and ecosystem services are critical to national and international climate mitigation discussions and to local communities that rely on these resources. Based on critical grassroots connections between scientists, stakeholders and decision makers, "Knowledge-to-Action" networks for ocean acidification issues have formed at local, regional and international scales to take action. Here, we review three examples of North American groups elevating the issue of ocean acidification at these three levels. They each focus on developing practicable, implementable steps to mitigate causes, to adapt to unavoidable change, and to build resilience to changing ocean conditions in the marine environment and coastal communities. While these first steps represent critical efforts in protecting ecosystems and economies from the risks posed by ocean acidification, some challenges remain. Sensitivity and risk to OA varies by region, species and ecosystems; priorities for action can vary between multiple and conflicting partners; evidence-based strategies for OA risk mitigation are still in the early stages; and gaps remain between scientific research and actionable decision-maker support products. However, the scaled networks profiled here have proven to be adept at identifying and addressing these barriers to action. In the future, it will be critical to expand funding for food web impact studies and development of decision support tools, and to maintain the connections between scientists and marine resource users to build resilience to ocean acidification impacts.

Such a situation would lead to a form of statelessness never experienced before in history and would raise serious concerns about migration as well as important legal questions. Although often mentioned in the media by NGOs and other international bodies, this issue has rarely been addressed by legal scholars or by social scientists specialized in migration studies. This chapter examines the available literature on the topic and presents basic geographic data to assess the validity of the danger. We then discuss the legal frameworks and policies that could be developed to mitigate the threat of climate change related statelessness, a concept that remains in need of clarification under both international law and human rights law. This chapter seeks to explore legal means to deal with populations displaced by the adverse impacts of climate change, that are consistent with a state's existing international legal obligations. The ongoing debate about this challenge aims to identify normative measures to secure a legal status for forced migrants, who risk becoming stateless when their state disappears.	disappearing states; environmental related statelessness; adaptation measures; migration strategies; human rights	2016	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

The lack of iron in seawater can cause barren grounds where algae cannot grow. To improve the barren grounds of the sea, a supply of iron to the seawater is necessary. This study focused on bacteria interacting with ISS and promoting iron elution in seawater. Sulfitobacter sp. (TO1A) and Pseudomonas sp. (TO1B) were isolated from Tokyo Bay and Sagami Bay. The co-culture of both bacteria promoted more iron elution than individual cultures. After the incubation of both bacteria with ISS, quartz and vaterite appeared on the surface of the ISS. To maintain continuous iron elution from the ISS in the seawater, we also isolated Pseudoalteromonas sp. (TO7) that formed a yellow biofilm on the ISS. Iron was eluted by TO1A and TO1B, and biofilm was synthesized by TO7 continuously in the seawater. The present research is expected to contribute to the improvement of ISS usage as a material for the construction of seaweed forests.	bacterial complex; biofilm; iron and steel slag; iron elution	2021	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

For this paper we evaluated over 200 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents published since 2012. We found that climate change in Central and South America during the 21st century may increase the risk to severe levels for the following topical risk clusters: (a) Food insecurity; (b) Floods and landslides; (c) Water scarcity; (d) Epidemics of vector-borne diseases; (e) Amazon Forest biome shift; (f). Coral bleaching; (g) Coastal risks of sea level rise, storm surges and erosion; (h) Systemic failure due to cascading impacts of hazards and epidemics. Our synthesis also identified feasible adaptation measures for each risk. The impacts of the risks will be heterogeneous throughout the region, with rural communities, Indigenous peoples, Afro-Latin Americans, women, disabled people, and migrants identified as being the most severely affected. We refer to a number of adaptation options for each risk. However, unabated climate change together with low adaptive capacity will strictly limit adaptation options. Immediate strengthening of policies for building adaptive capacity and increase of research on the risk-adaptation nexus in Central and South America are paramount. Our findings might contribute to guide the adjustment and emphasis of adaptation policies and climate risk management strategies from local to national level.	central and south america; climate projection; climate change impacts; adaptation; risks	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1

One of the ecological services of a mangrove ecosystem is carbon storage. Mangrove forests can store carbon four times higher than the world's tropical rainforest. This study aimed to assess the amount of carbon stored in mangrove stands in the Bagek Kembar mangrove ecotourism area, Sekotong West Lombok. This study uses a random sampling method, which is the placement of random plots in each mangrove zoning. The mangrove zoning is divided based on the distance from the sea and the river starting from 50 meters, 100 meters, 150 meters, 200 meters, 250 meters, and 300 meters. In addition, the mangrove area was divided into two mangrove statuses, which are natural mangrove succession and rehabilitation, and 10\% of the 5x5 meter observation plot sample was taken. So that there were 286 observation plots obtained. Calculation of mangrove biomass using allometric equations. The results of the estimation study of carbon deposits on mangrove stand biomass in the Bagek Kembar Mangrove Ecotourism area of a average of 6 zonings amounted to 10,738.49 kg/ha(2).

91761932	6284	2020.767	A review on coastal erosion and flooding risks and best management practices in West Africa: what has been done and should be done	The West African coast is vulnerable to natural hazards and human interventions. Although various measures have been taken at different scales, mostly at the local level, there is a need to improve management at the regional level. We examine these actions and possible solutions from different perspectives and provide conclusions and recommendations on the integration of solutions to improve coastal management. From North West Mauritania to across the Gulf of Guinea a system of coastal zoning that can be managed holistically is encouraged. The development of holistic planning is seen as a sustainable approach to management that seeks to link users/processes together rather than focus on a single particular issue and solution. Strengthening, monitoring, promoting the observation network and generalising open data centralisation and exchange for a better understanding of coastal dynamics and pressures is encouraged. There is a need for capacity building, expertise and federative actions. Furthermore, the need to identify and involve not only stakeholders, but also communities and scientists with multilevel inputs. All must agree on coordinated plans to achieve stakeholder objectives, using an approach adapted to the multi-spatial scale (e.g at the scale of sediment cells, integrating from the sources of sediment in river basins to their redistribution along the coast, perturbed by climate changes and anthropic stresses), so that only regional solutions are appropriate and will be effective.

A plan that considers changes in coastal systems and anticipates impacts and adapts plans accordingly will be key.	west africa; ecosystem-based management; coastal hazards; coastal vulnerability; coastal defence	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761938	251342	2012.42	Adaptation to climate change: the coastal zone of Barbados	Unsustainable development in the Caribbean has reduced the effectiveness of coastal ecosystems as ecological buffers against climate variability, climate change, extreme weather events, and sea level rise. Using Barbados as a case study, the research conducted first examined ecosystem degradation. Second, an analysis of adaptation options for climate change and rising sea levels was undertaken. Based on the study conducted, conclusions were drawn on the implementation challenges of adaptation measures and approaches, and areas for future research. The research found that hard engineering is highly prioritised because of the vulnerability of settlements, infrastructure, and beaches to erosion. Beach protection in particular receives significant attention because beach tourism is economically significant. Additionally, beach nourishment is popular in alleviating erosion. A major finding is that reactive and standalone protective efforts are less effective, so that hard and soft engineering measures, though economically costly, are combined responses. On the other hand, retreat and relocation are controversial given limited space, and are economically and politically costly.	beaches;  coastal engineering;  coastal zones;  cost engineering;  ecosystems;  erosion;  sea level;  shore protection, adaptation to climate changes;  beach nourishment;  climate variability;  coastal ecosystems;  ecosystem degradation;  extreme weather events;  infrastructure planning;  unsustainable development, climate change, beach nourishment;  climate change;  coastal engineering;  coastal protection;  coastal zone;  finance;  infrastructure planning;  sea level change, barbados	2012	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1

The paper focuses on several predictors including subjective flood risk perception, trust in government officials, sociodemographic characteristics, and experience with flood damage. Using binary logistic regression, the results show that the likelihood of having flood insurance coverage is associated with past flood damage and socioeconomic status. Older people (over age 65) are more likely to have flood insurance than younger residents. Race, gender, trust, and perceived flood risk are not statistically significant predictors of flood insurance. We connect our findings to the paradoxes and conflictual dynamics of flood insurance, a major risk mitigation measure. As we point out, in flood-prone cities like New Orleans, flood insurance operates as a double whammy: uninsured or underinsured homes face pervasive risk of both flooding and rising insurance premiums under the conditions of global climate change.	flood hazard; flood insurance; global climate change; coastal cities; social trust	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761949	5201	NA.78	Urban adaptation pathways at the edge of the anthropocene: lessons from the Blue Pacific Continent	Pacific Island cities exhibit high levels of informality. In these spaces, traditional cultural practices and production converge with the periphery of global financial markets and systems of trade and production. These hybrid, nonconforming urban systems fall between regional policy agendas, requiring practitioners to embed urban considerations within broader regional platforms such as climate change. This paper demonstrates how these ``covert{''} processes are used to advance urban justice at a settlement scale, both within and in resistance to city-level resilience frameworks and governance. In addition to a wider review of secondary data and Pacific urban literature the authors - non-Indigenous Pacific urban experts - draw upon empirical evidence from climate resilient development initiatives across the region. This includes case studies from the two Vanuatu municipalities of Luganville and Port Vila, and Honiara, the capital of Solomon Islands. Approaches for negotiating divergences between these functional systems of traditional and state justice within the urban domain are proposed, particularly in relation to disaster response and climate resilient development. Adaptation pathways are also presented, that draw upon decolonized visions of Pacific cities. These build upon observations of endogenous resilience in Pacific informal settlements; imaginaries centered upon quasi-customary urban governance, social structures, and ecosystem services.	urban planning; climate adaptation; informal settlements; pacific islands; sustainable development	NA	Devi	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

Mesoscale iron-enrichment to the HNLC subarctic Pacific induced a massive diatom bloom and led to a large decrease in pCO2. In response to the diatom bloom, the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Gyrodinium sp. increased and phagotrophically fed on the diatoms up to 12 times their length.Mathematical simulations show the carbon fixed by diatoms is mostly respired by Gyrodinium sp. in the sea surface. The emergence of initially rare species and their key biogeochemical roles were unexpected due to our limited understanding of food-web components. This indicates that the prediction of ecosystem responses to natural or anthropogenic perturbation remains a challenging issue. Effective carbon sequestration as a geoengineering technique may not be accomplished by purposeful ironenrichment, at least in the western subarctic Pacific where rapid-growth diatom grazers stand by.

91761954	6113	2020.740	Damage of extreme water levels and the adaptation cost of dikes in the Pearl River Delta	Many of the world's largest coastal cities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to extreme events due to their growing populations and infrastructure, the changing climate, and subsidence. This paper assessed the economic impacts of extreme climatic events including sea-level rise and storm surge risk and the benefits of the adaptation strategies in the Pearl River Delta, a lowing-lying area located in southern China. An economic benefit-cost model was established for the estimation of the impacts and benefits. The damage of the extreme events was calculated using the damage rate modeled from the historic disaster database, and then the difference between the damage and the cost of heightening dikes was investigated under different scenarios. The results showed that the damage rate and storm surge level were positively related. The adaptation strategies benefited when the dike was heightened by 1.43-12.67 m, with the optimum reached at 5.15 m, and the dike did not exceed 12.67 m. The maximum benefits were obtained when the dike was designed to defend a 20-year return period storm surge in 2100, and the minimum when the dike is heightened to defend a 100-year return period storm surge in 2100.	adaptation cost; extreme events; pearl river delta; sea-level rise; storm surge	2020	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761955	1226	2015.110	Evaluation of Networks of Plans and Vulnerability to Hazards and Climate Change	Problem, research strategy, and findings: Land use planning is key to mitigating natural hazards and the effects of climate change. Communities adopt multiple plans that directly and indirectly address hazard mitigation; the integration of local plans can significantly affect future community vulnerability to hazards. We develop a resilience scorecard to assess the degree to which the network of local plans targets areas most prone to hazards and then evaluate the coordination of local plans and test it in Washington (NC), a community vulnerable to coastal floods and projected sea-level rise. We find that local plans are not fully consistent and do not always address the areas in a community most vulnerable to floods or sea level risks; moreover, some plans actually increase physical and social vulnerability to hazards. While these results indicate the validity of a resiliency scorecard, we were forced to use a narrow range of vulnerability indicators; better data would improve the process.Takeaway for practice: Planners can assume a crucial role in improving planning for hazards by using the scorecard to identify conflicts among local plans, assessing whether local plans target areas most vulnerable to specific hazards. Planners can inform the public and decision makers about missed opportunities to improve local hazard mitigation planning. To support such important efforts, the U.S. Federal -Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies should consider developing additional databases that are widely applicable and available.	disaster resiliency; mitigation; land use planning; community vulnerability; network of plans; climate change	2015	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

This shift will require an adaptive response on the part of policy makers and fishery managers. In the U.S., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) established, in its fisheries agency (NOAA Fisheries), a set of social indicators of fishing community vulnerability and resilience to evaluate the impacts of changes in fishery management regimes. These indicators enhance the analytical capabilities within NOAA Fisheries for conducting fisheries social impact assessments and informing ecosystem-based fishery management. Building on the existing Community Social Vulnerability Indicators (CSVIs), new measures of climate change vulnerability are defined for the U.S. Eastern and Gulf coasts. These new indicators are used to assess the impact of sea level rise on critical commercial fishing infrastructure and the dependence of communities on species identified as vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Examples are provided in this article to demonstrate the utility of these new indicators to policy makers and the NOAA strategic goal for building resilient coastal communities that are environmentally and economically sustainable. Integration of CSVIs and the new climate change vulnerability indices highlight community needs for unique solutions in order to adapt to environmental and social changes and maintain their well-being.

91761958	12399	2022.1721	Contribution of longshore sand exchanges to mesoscale barrier-island behavior: Insights from the Virginia Barrier Islands, US East Coast	The development of coastal adaptation pathways along sandy barrier-island coasts requires an understanding of multi-decadal barrier morphodynamics in response to forcings such as sea-level rise, sediment fluxes, and storminess. Long-and cross-shore sand exchanges among barrier-system compartments (shorefaces, beaches, dunes, tidal inlets, backbarrier lagoons) and between adjacent barrier islands can play a fundamental role in barrier-system morphology and resilience to sea-level rise. We explore these dynamics through investigation of historical areal changes within the 13 largely undeveloped Virginia Barrier Islands of the United States Mid Atlantic Coast. We pair subaerial island areas mapped from historical surveys and modern aerial and satellite imagery with representative island thicknesses determined from stratigraphic and lidar-derived elevation data to estimate volumetric changes through time. Overall, the Virginia Barrier Islands lost-3.4\% (16 x 106 m3) of their 1887 C.E. volume between 1887 and 2017 C.E. The loss from three central islands (Parramore, Hog, and Cobb)- historically characterized by rotational behavior-was 43\% (79 x 106 m3). In particular, Parramore Island continuously decreased in volume over the 20th and 21st centuries. In contrast, growth of Assateague and northern Wallops islands (located at the northern, updrift end of the island chain) from 1887 to 2017 C.E. resulted in a volume increase of-59 x 106 m3. Whereas the Virginia Barrier Islands as a whole modestly decreased in size (and thus volume) directly in response to storm impacts and accelerating relative sea-level rise since the mid-1800s, the differential behavior of islands south of Assateague suggests more regional controls on coastal geomorphic behavior. Specifically, we identify the roles of antecedent substrate, sand trapping and changing wave-refraction patterns associated with the growth of Assateague Island, and inter-island sand exchanges in response to changing updrift barrier-scale behaviors. These findings help to better understand the underlying mechanisms behind state changes of barrier islands; in particular, the mechanisms by which geomorphic change along one barrier island influences those located several to tens of kilometers downdrift. This highlights the need to consider coastal beach and sand management over long reaches, even in systems which are largely unaffected by development, nourishment, and shoreline hardening. <comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment	barrier island; sediment flux; coastal change; sea-level rise; longshore transport	2022	Devi	Fred	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91761959	4637	2019.492	``Adapted mangrove on hybrid platform{''} - Coupling of ecological and engineering principles against coastal hazards	Mangrove forests are expected to act as green infrastructure against coastal hazards. However, mangroves cannot grow along urban coasts where the water is too deep and the wave is too high. This paper conceptualizes a new disaster countermeasure, coined as ``adaptive mangrove hybrid platform,{''} which provides a solution to achieve ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) in urban areas; particularly, those in developing countries. The proposed concept is a hybrid solution, starting from a landfill to level the seabed. A mangrove plantation is then established on the surface. The front part of the landfill is intentionally raised to form a shore-protection mound to reduce wave run-up that may wash away mangrove seedlings. Improvised technology such as wood piles and small stones can also be utilized to protect the landfill from erosion. The platform will inevitably sink owing to self-weight consolidation, land subsidence, and sea-level rise, while sediment deposition trapped by the developed mangrove forest may be the reliable avenue to raise the ground. Hence, the initial geometry of the landfill needs to be appropriately designed in order to achieve an equilibrium state whereby the ground surface is adaptively in balance with the relative sea-level rise. In this paper, many challenges as well as advantages are addressed, with the objective of promoting research to facilitate the exploration of adaptive mangrove hybrid platforms.	mangrove; coastal hazards; urban areas; land subsidence; sea-level rise; eco-drr; green infrastructure	2019	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761960	14033	2020.1739	``Like the plains people losing the buffalo{''}: perceptions of climate change impacts, fisheries management, and adaptation actions by Indigenous peoples in coastal British Columbia, Canada	Rapidly developing and complex climate change impacts have profound implications for coastal communities, demanding adaptation actions for both social and ecological systems. Along the coast of British Columbia, Canada, Indigenous peoples developed a tightly coupled social-ecological system that was interrupted by the arrival of settler colonialism in the 1800s. Although both climate change adaptation and the impacts of colonization have been well studied, little research has examined how these themes interact, and the conditions that may support or prevent people's ability to adapt to the social-ecological changes that emerge. Through a collaborative partnership with four First Nations and their umbrella organization for technical support, we examined people's perceptions of social and ecological aspects of adaptation to climate change. Using semistructured interviews (n = 50), four key strategies emerged as critical for climate change adaptation: (1) strengthening Indigenous governance autonomy and authority, (2) promoting knowledge sharing for adaptation practices within and among communities, (3) promoting adaptive comanagement among governance scales, and (4) developing learning platforms for climate impacts and adaptive strategies. Actions typically proposed by non-Indigenous government, including marine protected areas and ecosystem-based management were not prioritized. We found diverse attitudes toward climate change impacts, indicating that people's perceptions of adaptation strategies are strongly influenced by exposure to observable impacts, the social-ecological context in which they live, and perceptions of governance and self-determination. Our study suggests that supporting Indigenous peoples' ability to adapt to climate change will require transforming the current governance model into one that acknowledges Indigenous social, cultural, and food needs and how these relate to marine resources and territorial management rights.	adaptation; climate change; fisheries; food security; governance; indigenous stewardship; transformation	2020	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91761965	24756	2021.2791	Millennial-Scale Carbon Storage in Natural Pine Forests of the North Carolina Lower Coastal Plain: Effects of Artificial Drainage in a Time of Rapid Sea Level Rise	Coastal forested wetlands provide important ecosystem services along the southeastern region of the United States, but are threatened by anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Here, we examined the species composition, mortality, aboveground biomass, and carbon content of vegetation and soils in natural pine forests of the lower coastal plain in eastern North Carolina, USA. We compared a forest clearly in decline (termed ``ghost forest{''}) adjacent to a roadside canal that had been installed as drainage for a road next to an adjacent forest subject to ``natural{''} hydrology, unaltered by human modification (termed ``healthy forest{''}). We also assessed how soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation changed over time using C-14 radiocarbon dating of wood sampled at different depths within the peat profile. Our results showed that the ghost forest had a higher tree density at 687 trees ha(-1), and was dominated by swamp bays (Persea palustric), compared to the healthy forest, which had 265 trees ha(-1) dominated by pond pine (Pinus serotina Michx). Overstory tree mortality of the ghost forest was nearly ten times greater than the healthy forest (p < 0.05), which actually contributed to higher total aboveground biomass (55.9 +/- 12.6 Mg C ha(-1) vs. 27.9 +/- 8.7 Mg ha(-1) in healthy forest), as the dead standing tree biomass (snags) added to that of an encroaching woody shrub layer during ecosystem transition. Therefore, the total aboveground C content of the ghost forest, 33.98 +/- 14.8 Mg C ha(-1), was higher than the healthy forest, 24.7 +/- 5.2 Mg C ha(-1) (p < 0.05). The total SOC stock down to a 2.3 m depth in the ghost forest was 824.1 +/- 46.2 Mg C ha(-1), while that of the healthy forest was 749.0 +/- 170.5 Mg C ha(-1) (p > 0.05). Carbon dating of organic sediments indicated that, as the sample age approaches modern times (surface layer year 2015), the organic soil accumulation rate (1.11 to 1.13 mm year(-1)) is unable to keep pace with the estimated rate of recent sea level rise (2.1 to 2.4 mm year(-1)), suggesting a causative relationship with the ecosystem transition occurring at the site. Increasing hydrologic stress over recent decades appears to have been a major driver of ecosystem transition, that is, ghost forest formation and woody shrub encroachment, as indicated by the far higher overstory tree mortality adjacent to the drainage ditch, which allows the inland propagation of hydrologic/salinity forcing due to SLR and extreme storms. Our study documents C accumulation in a coastal wetland over the past two millennia, which is now threatened due to the recent increase in the rate of SLR exceeding the natural peat accumulation rate, causing an ecosystem transition with unknown consequences for the stored C; however, much of it will eventually be returned to the atmosphere. More studies are needed to determine the causes and consequences of coastal ecosystem transition to inform the modeling of future coastal wetland responses to environmental change and the estimation of regional terrestrial C stocks and flux.	ghost forest; forested wetland; aboveground biomass; soil carbon; carbon dating	2021	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761974	306013	2019.1388	Dimensions of Blue Carbon and emerging perspectives	Blue Carbon is a term coined in 2009 to draw attention to the degradation of marine and coastal ecosystems and the need to conserve and restore them to mitigate climate change and for the other ecosystem services they provide. Blue Carbon has multiple meanings, which we aim to clarify here, which reflect the original descriptions of the concept including (1) all organic matter captured by marine organisms, and (2) how marine ecosystems could be managed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thereby contribute to climate change mitigation and conservation. The multifaceted nature of the Blue Carbon concept has led to unprecedented collaboration across disciplines, where scientists, conservationists and policy makers have interacted intensely to advance shared goals. Some coastal ecosystems (mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass) are established Blue Carbon ecosystems as they often have high carbon stocks, support long-term carbon storage, offer the potential to manage greenhouse gas emissions and support other adaptation policies. Some marine ecosystems do not meet key criteria for inclusion within the Blue Carbon framework (e.g. fish, bivalves and coral reefs). Others have gaps in scientific understanding of carbon stocks or greenhouse gas fluxes, or currently there is limited potential for management or accounting for carbon sequestration (macroalgae and phytoplankton), but may be considered Blue Carbon ecosystems in the future, once these gaps are addressed.

91761976	803	2022.114	Resilience and coastal governance: knowledge and navigation between stability and transformation	Several intergovernmental agreements highlight the need for resilience in the face of environmental and societal challenges. Coastal systems are particularly complex and susceptible to global climate change, and building human resilience to future changes is of high priority. While the concept of resilience has historically been associated with stability to perturbations, the notion of transformation within the social-ecological resilience (SER) approach has recently gained importance in ecosystem management. In order to operationalize resilience in the context of coastal governance in a changing climate, a better understanding of the concept is required. This paper provides an overview of different approaches to resilience, including stability and transformation, in order to understand resilience as a concept in a coastal governance context. Subsequently, we propose five steps and three types of knowledge (system, target, transformative) with which to embed SER in coastal governance. In addition, we consider scale and system boundaries; identify (un)desirable system characteristics and the role of normative goals and common visions in resilience management. Finally, we highlight the central role that local actors and information services play in fostering a two-way exchange between science and society and tailoring solutions for establishing or enhancing SER to the needs of local actors. We conclude that the navigation between stability and transformation within the concept of resilience is central to finding sustainable future pathways in the face of climate change.	climate change; ecosystem management; information services; knowledge co-production; social-ecological systems; sustainability	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91761977	1142	2022.160	Anthropogenic Mixing in Seasonally Stratified Shelf Seas by Offshore Wind Farm Infrastructure	The offshore wind energy sector has rapidly expanded over the past two decades, providing a renewable energy solution for coastal nations. Sector development has been led in Europe, but is growing globally. Most developments to date have been in well-mixed, i.e., unstratified, shallow-waters near to shore. Sector growth is, for the first time, pushing developments to deep water, into a brand new environment: seasonally stratified shelf seas. Seasonally stratified shelf seas, where water density varies with depth, have a disproportionately key role in primary production, marine ecosystem and biogeochemical cycling. Infrastructure will directly mix stratified shelf seas. The magnitude of this mixing, additional to natural background processes, has yet to be fully quantified. If large enough it may erode shelf sea stratification. Therefore, offshore wind growth may destabilize and fundamentally change shelf sea systems. However, enhanced mixing may also positively impact some marine ecosystems. This paper sets the scene for sector development into this new environment, reviews the potential physical and environmental benefits and impacts of large scale industrialization of seasonally stratified shelf seas and identifies areas where research is required to best utilize, manage, and mitigate environmental change.	offshore wind energy; shelf seas; marine biogeochemistry; stratification; turbulent mixing	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91761980	24390	2017.1795	Imaging the Aquistore reservoir after 36 kilotonnes of CO2 injection using distributed acoustic sensing	Aquistore is a geologic CO2 storage project that is using a deep saline formation as a storage reservoir. From April 2015 to February 2016, approximately 36 kilotonnes of CO2 were injected into the reservoir at a depth of 3130-3350 m. We have developed an analysis of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) 3D vertical seismic profiling data acquired in February 2016, marking the first seismic survey since injection began. The VSP data were processed in parallel with baseline preinjection data from a November 2013 survey, with the objective of detecting and characterizing the subsurface CO2 plume and evaluating the repeatability of DAS in a reservoir monitoring project. A single processing sequence was devised that (1) accurately imaged the reservoir for the baseline and monitor data and (2) attained adequate repeatability to observe time-lapse differences related to the presence of CO2. Repeatability was somewhat compromised by the less advanced noise cancellation methodology of the DAS system used for the baseline survey. In the final cross-equalized migrated data volumes, normalized root-mean-square (nrms) difference values of < 0.4 were attained at the reservoir level indicating good repeatability compared with most surface seismic studies. An injection-related amplitude anomaly with maximum nrms values of approximately 0.7 is apparent in the Deadwood Formation of the reservoir, whereas no significant nrms anomalies were observed near the injection and monitoring wells in the Black Island Member or above the reservoir.

Given the complex pathways that lead to SWI, coastal urban areas with poorly monitored aquifers are in need of probabilistic-based decision support tools that can assist in better understanding and predicting SWI, while exploring effective means for sustainable aquifer management. In this study, we develop a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) to account for the complex interactions of climatic and anthropogenic processes leading to SWI, while relating the severity of SWI to associated socioeconomic impacts and possible adaptation strategies. The BBN is further expanded into a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to assess the temporal progression of SWI and account for the compounding uncertainties over time. The proposed DBN is then tested at a pilot coastal aquifer underlying a highly urbanized water-stressed metropolitan area along the Eastern Mediterranean coastline (Beirut, Lebanon). The results show that the future impacts of climate change are largely secondary when compared to the persistent water deficits. While both supply and demand management could halt the progression of salinity, the potential for reducing or reversing SWI is not evident. The indirect socioeconomic burden associated with aquifer salinity was observed to improve, albeit heterogeneously, with the application of various adaptation strategies; however, this was at a cost associated with the implementation and operation of these strategies. The proposed DBN acts as an effective decision support tool that can promote sustainable aquifer management in coastal regions through its robust representation of the main drivers of SWI and linking them to expected socioeconomic burdens and management options.

91762009	260789	2017.1073	Review of GHG emissions in Pakistan compared to SAARC countries	Fossil fuel consumption, luxurious lifestyles, population and economic growths are drivers of climate change. Rampant rise in Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions drives the big wheel of climate change which affects human societies, animal habitats and woodlands by flash floods, glacial melts, acidic rains, droughts, famines, wildfires, epidemics, heat and cold waves. South Asia is one of the most severely affected regions on the planet due to its demographics. The per capita impact of climate change on the millions of Pakistanis is very high compared to their diminutive per capita share of global GHG emissions. Environmental issues of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries include deforestation, air pollution, desertification, glacial melts, sea level rise, water contamination and loss of biodiversity. Pakistan is among the top ten countries worst hit by climate change, where native populations of lions, leopards, dolphins, tortoise and vultures face extinction threat. Acacia and rosewood tree forests in Sindh, Punjab and Pak-Afghan precincts have already dried by dieback disease during 1998â€“2005. Hundreds of people succumb to death annually by heat waves in South during summer and cold waves in North during winter. Climate change is a global phenomenon; nevertheless, higher GHG emissions first affect local and regional territories and later impact worldwide. Pakistan's CO2 emissions are greater than least developed SAARC countries but much lower than the nearby Himalayan slope countries. This paper reports impact of CO2 emissions on society, forests, crops and wildlife in Pakistan recounting adaptation and mitigation strategies in SAARC countries. We present simulation results for a future super smart grid connecting Central Asian States (CAS) to SAARC countries for bilateral electricity trade, progress in carbon capture and storage technologies in SAARC countries, and original research on utilizing CO2 (R744) for water heating in extremely cold regions.

Since 2008 pilot customer vessels have been operating propulsion kites in order to reduce fuel costs and emissions. In this contribution the SkySails towing kite technology is introduced and an overview over its core components kite, control pod, towing rope, and launch and retrieval system is provided. Subsequently the principles of force generation and propulsion are summarized. In the following part the system's application to airborne wind energy generation is presented, where the kite forces are used to pull the towing rope off a drum, powering a generator in the process. When the maximum tether length is reached, the kite is reeled back to the starting point using the generator as a motor. A functional model was constructed and successfully tested to prove the positive energy balance of this so-called pumping mode energy generation experimentally. An evaluation of the technology's market potential, particularly for offshore wind farms, concludes the contribution.

91762015	13970	2020.1732	Salt farmer's adaptation strategy facing climate change (case study in Pati Regency)	Climates change impact on salt productions in Pati Regency. The salt farmer usually only shifts to aquaculture in the rainy season. Thus, while the climate becomes unpredictable, they adapted to extreme weather conditions. However, changes in weather such as dryer summers, rain in summer, more extended summer season, longer rainy season, and high tides. It made the salt production decrease. Salt farmer have their adaptation strategies during climate change. This research aims to analyze reasons for adaptation strategies regarding climate change. The research conducted in Pati Regency from 2011 to 2016. Pati Regency is the 3rd most significant salt production area in Indonesia. We interviewed the respondents, as well as confirmed the data to other farmers, extension officers, and agency officers in the district. The data used in this paper are the salt farmer perception is regarding climate change and their adaptation strategies. We also used content analysis to strengthen our data based on literature and other founding. We found that Salt farmers use their strategy to fasten production, such as using canvas, black stone, LDPE (Low-Density Poly Ethylene), and HDPE (High-Density Poly Ethylene). LDPE and HDPE were introduced by Ministry Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) in 2013 and turned out to be very helpful for the farmers. The technology introduced by MMAF increased production by 14\% and price by 144\% than before while working loads become lighter, especially in the harvesting process. Several adaptation strategies have implemented in other Regencies, such as MMAF technology. However, it still needs continuous persuasion because not all farmers wanted to apply it.

91763599	22491	2013.1089	Offshore CCS in the northern Gulf of Mexico and the significance of regional structural compartmentalization	Many countries foresee the ability of offshore geologic settings to meet anticipated long-term national CO2 storage needs. Although the costs of operating offshore are significant, they may be offset by reduced issues of risk, property ownership and long-term liability. Continued interest in offshore CCS (e. g., EU, Australia, Japan, and U. S. A.) has focused on aspects familiar to onshore work: storage capacity, risk, monitoring, and containment assurance. Over the last decade, the Gulf Coast Carbon Center at the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology conducted numerous studies of storage potential along the eastern seaboard of the U. S. and the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Much of the work focused on regional geologic characterization, capacity assessment, and identification of potential risks and migration pathways. In general, capacity estimates indicate that the offshore storage resource has been under-appreciated as a national resource in the United States, but is receiving more attention. Current research efforts focus on the offshore northwestern GOM where the bulk of potential storage capacity resides. The work has also focused attention on the significant role of regional structural compartmentalization on storage capacity, pressure evolution, potential migration pathways, and long-term containment.

91763619	284558	2022.4730	Unravelling the ecological impacts of large-scale offshore wind farms in the Mediterranean Sea	The need for alternative energy systems like offshore wind power to move towards the Green Deal objectives is undeniable. However, it is also increasingly clear that biodiversity loss and climate change are interconnected issues that must be tackled in unison. In this paper we highlight that offshore wind farms (OWF) in the Mediterranean Sea (MS) pose serious environmental risks to the seabed and the biodiversity of many areas due to the particular ecological and socioeconomic characteristics and vulnerability of this semi-enclosed sea. The MS hosts a high diversity of species and habitats, many of which are threatened. Furthermore, valuable species, habitats, and seascapes for citizens' health and well-being coexist with compounding effects of other economic activities (cruises, maritime transport, tourism activities, fisheries and aquaculture) in a busy space on a narrower continental shelf than in other European seas. We argue that simply importing the OWF models from the northern European seas, which are mostly based on large scale projects, to other seas like the Mediterranean is not straightforward. The risks of implementing these wind farms in the MS have not yet been well evaluated and, considering the Precautionary Principle incorporated into the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, they should not be ignored. We propose that OWF development in the MS should be excluded from high biodiversity areas containing sensitive and threatened species and habitats, particularly those situated inside or in the vicinity of Marine Protected Areas or areas with valuable seascapes. In the absence of a clearer and comprehensive EU planning of wind farms in the MS, the trade-off between the benefits (climate goals) and risks (environmental and socioeconomic impacts) of OWF could be unbalanced in favor of the risks.

91763634	386973	2021.19161	Development and assessment of a solar driven trigeneration system with storage for electricity, ammonia and fresh water production	This research paper designs and analyzes a novel integrated solar-driven system for ammonia synthesis, freshwater production and power generation. The trigeneration system contains a solar thermal subsystem, a thermal energy storage system where the molten salt is used as a heat transfer fluid and storage medium, a solar energy-driven Rankine cycle, a multistage flash distillation, a proton exchange membrane electrolyser array, and an ammonia synthesis unit. The proposed integrated system uses solar energy to charge the molten salt, which flows through a heat exchanger and generates steam for the topping cycle. The exhaust stream of the steam turbine provides heat for the multistage flash distillation (MFD) process. A 20 stage MFD unit is proposed where the seawater is utilized as the feedwater in this study. A portion of the produced freshwater is sent to the PEM electroylzer array for hydrogen production, which is used for ammonia production via the Haber-Bosch process. The thermodynamic analysis of the solar driven multigeneration system is analyzed through the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) and Aspen Plus software packages. The novelty of this study relies on the development of a new solar energy-based integrated system and its application for a selected community with over 10,000 residents to meet all of their needs to be self-sufficient and sustainable. Ammonia (for multiple purposes, such as fuel, energy carrier and feedstock), freshwater and electricity are the useful outputs as targeted in this paper. The study incorporates the phase change materials into the system for thermal energy storage purposes. The performance assessments based on energy and exergy efficiencies are carried out for the overall system and its components. Furthermore, the power, freshwater and ammonia production capacities are studied for better demand coverage. The overall exergy efficiency of the system is determined as 12.1 %, where the ammonia synthesis, power generation, and freshwater production capacities are 0.85 kg/s, 17.6 MW, and 143.97 kg/h respectively. Moreover, the study investigates the energy and exergy efficiencies with and without the presence of an air separation unit. The study results show that the air separation unit has less than 0.3% effect on the overall energy and exergy efficiencies.

Blue carbon ecosystem functionality is one component of coastal nature-based or green-gray infrastructure multifunctionality, which includes contributions by nature to disaster risk reduction, infrastructure resilience, erosion control, land formation, and other ecosystem services. Here we review how green infrastructure and nature-based solutions in coastal and shallow nearshore areas can contribute to blue climate change mitigation and adaptation. We then summarize available coastal infrastructure types (green, gray, and green-gray hybrid) in terms of their inherent functions and potential co-benefits. We discuss technologies for integrating gray and green infrastructure and producing hybrid infrastructure to promote implementation of measures for both climate change and infrastructure development, although the best infrastructure type is dependent on the risks of a given time and locality. Collaboration among engineers, scientists, and economists who are interested in climate change or infrastructure and in emerging fields such as blue carbon and green infrastructure are needed to further enhance the implementation of multifunctional infrastructure, but the multifunctionality benefits should be quantified and monetized.	blue carbon ecosystem; nature-based solution; living shoreline; building with nature; blue economy	2021	Fred	NA	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763654	260954	2017.2820	The Energy Capture Efficiency Increased by Choosing the Optimal Layout of Turbines in Tidal Power Farm	In recent years, with the development of global economy, many environmental issues, such as energy shortage and global warming are becoming more and more serious all over the world, and more attention was paid on the better use of marine renewable energy. Among all the variety of marine renewable energy, tidal power generation technology is relatively mature. In order to gain more tidal energy for the purpose of commercial application, one of the best ways is to make turbine arrays in tidal power farm. Because of the wake effects on tidal steam turbines in tidal power farm, the performance of the flow field around the turbines was changed and has impact on the capture efficiency of electric power. Therefore, study on the interaction effects on tidal stream turbines and the optimization of the layout of the tidal stream turbine array becomes one of the key problems in the construction of tidal power farm, which directly influences the economic benefits of tidal power farm. There are many parameters that have impact on turbines in tidal farms, such as the distance between turbines, the longitudinal and lateral layout, the rotation direction of rotors, and so on. In this paper, different approaches (such as numerical calculating and simulation, model test, etc.) to study on the optimizing the layout of the horizontal axis tidal steam turbines in tidal power farm were introduced. These research works will provide theoretical basis for the construction of tidal power farms in the future. Optimized layout of turbines in tidal power farm can increase the capture efficiency of tidal turbines, and it has great sense to relieve energy shortage and global warming problem by obtaining more marine renewable energy.

As a result, there is increased interest in sustainable and adaptable methods of coastal protection. Dynamic cobble berm revetments consist of a gravel berm installed close to the high tide shoreline on a sand beach and are designed to mimic naturally occurring composite beaches (dissipative sandy beaches with a gravel berm around the high tide shoreline). Existing approaches to predict wave runup on sand or pure gravel beaches have very poor skill for composite beaches and this restricts the ability of coastal engineers to assess flood risks at existing sites or design new protection structures. This paper presents high-resolution measurements of wave runup from five field and large-scale laboratory experiments investigating composite beaches and dynamic cobble berm revetments. These data demonstrated that as the swash zone transitions from the fronting sand beach to the gravel berm, the short-wave component of significant swash height rapidly increases and can dominate over the infragravity component. When the berm toe is submerged at high tide, it was found that wave runup is strongly controlled by the water depth at the toe of the gravel berm. This is due to the decoupling of the significant wave height at the berm toe from the offshore wave conditions due to the dissipative nature of the fronting sand beach. This insight, combined with new methods to predict wave setup and infragravity wave dissipation on composite beaches is used to develop the first composite beach/dynamic revetment-specific methodologies for predicting wave runup.	wave runup; swash; dynamic cobble berm revetment; dynamic revetment; composite beach; wave reflection	2022	Fred	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Protection and restoration of these habitats therefore have the potential to deliver climate change mitigation and co-benefits. Here we present the existing knowledge on Nordic BC habitats in terms of habitat area, C-stocks and sequestration rates, co-benefits, policies and management status to inspire a coherent Nordic BC roadmap. The area extent of BC habitats in the region is incompletely assessed, but available information sums up to 1,440 km(2) salt marshes, 1,861 (potentially 2,735) km(2) seagrass meadows, and 16,532 km(2) (potentially 130,735 km(2), including coarse Greenland estimates) brown macroalgae, yielding a total of 19,833 (potentially 134,910) km(2). Saltmarshes and seagrass meadows have experienced major declines over the past century, while macroalgal trends are more diverse. Based on limited salt marsh data, sediment C-stocks average 3,311 g C-org m(-2) (top 40-100 cm) and sequestration rates average 142 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1). Eelgrass C-stocks average 2,414 g C-org m(-2) (top 25 cm) and initial data for sequestration rates range 5-33 g C-org m(-2), quantified for one Greenland site and one short term restoration. For Nordic brown macroalgae, peer-reviewed estimates of sediment C-stock and sequestration are lacking. Overall, the review reveals substantial Nordic BC-stocks, but highlights that evidence is still insufficient to provide a robust estimate of all Nordic BC-stocks and sequestration rates. Needed are better quantification of habitat area, C-stocks and fluxes, particularly for macroalgae, as well as identification of target areas for BC management. The review also points to directives and regulations protecting Nordic marine vegetation, and local restoration initiatives with potential to increase C-sequestration but underlines that increased coordination at national and Nordic scales and across sectors is needed. We propose a Nordic BC roadmap for science and management to maximize the potential of BC habitats to mitigate climate change and support coastal protection, biodiversity and additional ecosystem functions.	eelgrass; salt marsh; macroalgae; area distribution; carbon stock; carbon sequestration; ecosystem services; management	2022	Fred	Devi	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763693	240167	2007.2296	Sandy barriers, climate change and long-term planning of strategic coastal infrastructures, Iles-de-la-Madeleine, Gulf of St. Lawrence (Quebec, Canada)	The case study of Iles-de-la-Madeleine is presented to illustrate one aspect of the challenge facing coastal communities with regard to relative sea-level rise and climate change, namely the management of strategic infrastructures located within the coastal zone. GIS mapping has been carried out in two sites where the main road system of this archipelago, Highway 199, is located on sandy barriers and where the road has been threatened by chronic erosion problems for several decades. Our results confirm the dynamic nature of the barriers components (habitats, inlets and tidal deltas) and document the impacts of road-related modifications to the coastal system. These alterations have resulted in significant changes to coastal habitats, including loss due to coastal squeeze between the retreating shoreline and the coastal protection structures. Resort to riprap structures also impacted the evolution of the coastline and further coast hardening might jeopardize the morpho-sedimentary equilibrium of the barriers. To ensure the sustainability of coastal resources and secure Highway 199, it appears that a change is required, from an ad hoc type of management of coastal erosion towards the inclusion of the management of the road system within a long-term and integrated planning of the coastal zone.

Amsterdam is located in-between water bodies and bogs. If the people of Amsterdam needed habitable land, they had to create it themselves. In 1996 the municipality decided to embark on a new land reclamation project, a group of islands called IJburg. Several major issues had to be overcome. The project site has extremely weak subsoil. In order to create a stable island, the pancake method was used. An inventive solution to prevent silt from dispersing using silt curtains is currently being tested for application during the construction of IJburg phase II. IJburg was designed with a system of internal waterways to manage the groundwater levels of the islands. IJburg also has a system of sluices, dykes and embankments in order to protect IJburg from the IJmeer and rising sea levels. Environmental aspects are very important. IJburg is located next to a severely polluted former dumping ground for chemical waste, which had to be rehabilitated. Furthermore, several nature development projects (man-made mussel beds and dams to create sheltered waters) are being realized. Upon completion, IJburg will offer housing for approximately 45 000 inhabitants and jobs for 12 000 people.

91763705	267750	2022.3421	A feasibility assessment for co-locating and powering offshore aquaculture with wave energy in the United States	Offshore aquaculture and marine renewable energy (energy from waves, tides, currents, and ocean gradients) are two developing ocean-based industries. Aquaculture, an industry that has typically relied on diesel for power, is expected to grow globally, presenting an opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable sources as it expands. As the aquaculture industry moves further offshore and is situated in more energetic environments, the prospect to co-locate offshore aquaculture with wave energy increases. To improve understanding of this potential, a feasibility assessment was completed to estimate the energy needs and wave resource required to power offshore finfish aquaculture operations. The study found it is possible to power offshore aquaculture operations entirely with wave energy. A spatial analysis was then performed to assess the suitability of co-locating offshore finfish aquaculture and wave energy off California and Hawaii. Suitable locations were identified offshore of O'ahu, Hawaii, and northern California. Southern California was also assessed, using a lower wave resource, based on study areas evaluated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to identify Aquaculture Opportunity Areas, and while limited there are suitable locations that may warrant further evaluation. This study presents an analysis into the potential to pair wave energy with offshore aquaculture, and how various factors can help determine suitable areas for co-location. The methods developed in this study will support future identification of potential sites for development and decision-making to optimize the success of co-locating wave energy resources and offshore finfish aquaculture.

These phenomena could have catastrophic impacts on coastal communities and result in the destruction of critical infrastructure, disruption of economic activities and salt water contamination of the water supply. The objective of the study presented in this paper was to identify various impacts of sea level rise on civil infrastructures in coastal areas and examine the adaptation measures suggested in the existing literature. To this end, a systemic review of the existing literature was conducted in order to identify a repository of studies addressing sea level rise impacts and adaptation measures in the context of infrastructure systems. The study focused on three infrastructure sectors: water and wastewater, energy, and road transportation. The collected information was then analyzed in order to identify different categories of sea level rise impacts and corresponding adaptation measures. The findings of the study are threefold: (1) the major categories of sea level rise impacts on different infrastructure systems; (2) measures for protection, accommodation, and retreat in response to sea level rise impacts; and (3) challenges related to implementing adaptation measures.	sea level rise; infrastructure systems; coastal areas; impacts; adaptation measures; implementation challenges; energy; water and wastewater; transportation	2016	Fred	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763722	10271	2022.1418	Social-ecological vulnerability of fishing communities to climate change: A US West Coast case study	Climate change is already impacting coastal communities, and ongoing and future shifts in fisheries species productivity from climate change have implications for the livelihoods and cultures of coastal communities. Harvested marine species in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem support U.S. West Coast communities economically, socially, and culturally. Ecological vulnerability assessments exist for individual species in the California Current but ecological and human vulnerability are linked and vulnerability is expected to vary by community. Here, we present automatable, reproducible methods for assessing the vulnerability of U.S. West Coast fishing dependent communities to climate change within a social-ecological vulnerability framework. We first assessed the ecological risk of marine resources, on which fishing communities rely, to 50 years of climate change projections. We then combined this with the adaptive capacity of fishing communities, based on social indicators, to assess the potential ability of communities to cope with future changes. Specific communities (particularly in Washington state) were determined to be at risk to climate change mainly due to economic reliance on at risk marine fisheries species, like salmon, hake, or sea urchins. But, due to higher social adaptive capacity, these communities were often not found to be the most vulnerable overall. Conversely, certain communities that were not the most at risk, ecologically and economically, ranked in the category of highly vulnerable communities due to low adaptive capacity based on social indicators (particularly in Southern California). Certain communities were both ecologically at risk due to catch composition and socially vulnerable (low adaptive capacity) leading to the highest tier of vulnerability. The integration of climatic, ecological, economic, and societal data reveals that factors underlying vulnerability are variable across fishing communities on the U.S West Coast, and suggests the need to develop a variety of well-aligned strategies to adapt to the ecological impacts of climate change.

91763726	13991	2022.1941	Strengthening climate-resilient development and transformation in Viet Nam	Climate change is presenting an ongoing and eminent threat to various regions, communities and infrastructure worldwide. In this study, the current and future climate impacts faced by Viet Nam due to Tropical Cyclones (TCs), specifically wind and surge, are evaluated, and different adaptation measures to manage this risk are appraised. The level of wind and storm surge risk was assessed focusing on three categories of assets: residential houses, agriculture, and people. The expected damage to these assets was then evaluated based on their exposure to the hazard under current and future climate scenarios. Physical adaptation measures such as mangroves, sea dykes, and gabions, and financial adaptation measures such as risk transfer via insurance were applied to the expected future risk and evaluated based on a socio-economic cost-benefit analysis. The output will give decision-makers the ability to make more informed decisions, prioritize the most cost-effective adaptation measures and increase physical and financial resilience. The results indicated significant TC exposure in future climate scenarios due to economic development and climate change that almost doubles the current expected damage. Surge-related damage was found to be many times higher than wind damage, and houses had more exposure (value in total) than agriculture on a national scale. The physical adaptation measures are successful in significantly reducing the future wind and especially surge risk and would form a resilient strategy along with risk transfer for managing TC risks in the region.	climate resilience; coastal protection; tropical cyclones; cost-benefit; insurance; nature-based solutions	2022	Fred	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763736	251323	2013.643	Development and Application of a Geo-temporal Atlas for Climate Change Adaptation in Bay of Fundy Dykelands	Globally, dykelands (former marsh areas protected by dykes) are of strategic importance for climate change adaptation. Many were originally designed to protect agricultural land, yet now protect valuable infrastructure. The purpose of this project was to develop a comprehensive digital atlas incorporating historical plans, shore protection, coastal geomorphology and LiDAR to serve as a basis for climate change adaptation planning in the Bay of Fundy. 110 paper plans were scanned, geo-referenced and features such as current and historical dykes, aboiteaux (tide gates), armouring, ditches, creeks, property boundaries, foreshore marsh, and geodetic elevations were digitized using ArcGIS. Attributes included age of structure, material, dimensions, and ownership. Dyke elevations were surveyed using an RTK GPS, and individual sections were identified as being vulnerable to storm surge and sea level rise. Erosion rates and width of foreshore marsh were calculated per dyke segment. At present, 55% of dykes within Nova Scotia are within 0.5 m of critical elevations established in the 1960s, 2% are more than 0.5 m below critical and all are below the predicted rates of SLR by 2055. There is also a strong relationship between the placement of armouring along the dyke toe and foreshore erosion. Conversely, timely placement of armouring along the foreshore marsh decreased rates of erosion. This was most effective in areas with the largest fetch; less effective where erosion was driven by tidal currents. All data were integrated into ArcReader for use by Agriculture personnel and have been essential for cost effective climate change adaptation planning including dyke topping, hazard mitigation and education.

91763737	13406	2016.1035	Fisheries management approaches as platforms for climate change adaptation: Comparing theory and practice in Australian fisheries	This study examines the extent to which the choice of management approach is a critical factor in enabling climate change adaptation in marine fisheries. Climate change is expected to compound many pressing issues affecting fisheries management. Good governance of fisheries, which is critical to building their adaptive capacity and social-ecological resilience, is seen as ever more important in the context of climate change. A range of fisheries management approaches have been developed and, to varying degrees, applied. Each has been described in the literature as a promising way to manage marine resources. Through literature reviews and a survey of practitioners, this study explores how theoretical properties of selected major management approaches (i.e., ecosystem-based management, adaptive management, co-management, adaptive co-management, and active adaptive management) enable climate change adaptation, and how such properties are perceived by practitioners to manifest in practice using an Australian marine fisheries context. Overall, the selected management approaches have the potential to enable climate change adaptation to varying degrees. Ecosystem-based management, in combination with adaptive management and co-management as nested management approaches, possesses the full array of adaptation capacities and attributes required for adaptation in fisheries. Distinctions between theory and practice observed in this study highlight the importance of practitioner perceptions and enabling institutional arrangements in adapting management to climate change.

91763746	5247	2011.201	Coastal flood protection: What perspective in a changing climate? The THESEUS approach	Coastal areas are vital economic hubs in terms of settlement, industry, agriculture, trade and tourism to mention some key sectors. There are already many coastal problems including erosion, flood risk and long-term habitat deterioration. As economies continue to develop the asset base at risk will grow, while accelerating climate change will increase the likelihood of damaging extreme events, as well as accelerate habitat decline. Existing coastal management and defence approaches are not well tuned to these challenges as they assume a static situation. THESEUS project is developing a systematic approach to delivering both a low-risk coast for human use and healthy habitats for evolving coastal zones subject to multiple change factors. The project examines innovative mitigation and adaptation technologies and integrate the best of these technical measures in a strategic policy context through over-arching guidelines. THESEUS activities are carried out within a multidisciplinary framework using 8 study sites across Europe, with specific attention to the most vulnerable coastal environments such as deltas, estuaries and wetlands, where many large cities and industrial areas are located. This paper describes THESEUS approach, and specifically: the Source-Pathway-Receptor-Consquence model for coastal risk assessment; the engineering, social, economic and ecological mitigation measures under analysis; the participatory approach with end users and coastal authorities for the selection and identification of the appropriate defence strategy to be planned in sudy sites.

91763761	509	2021.58	The Comparative Study of Adaptation Measure to Sea Level Rise in Thailand	In the 21st century, global sea level rise associated with climate change will affect beach areas, which provide a number of benefits that include benefits to the recreational sector of the economy. In Thailand, the adoption of structural measures in order to slow down beach erosion and handle the impact of sea level rise is commonly implemented. However, structural measures often bring about negative effects on nearby coastal areas. For this reason, suitable adaptation measures should be determined, in order to protect beach areas and to sustain the tourism carrying capacity of the beach. This study analyzed historical shoreline changes using satellite images, and assessed beach value with the hedonic pricing method. We used a benefit-cost ratio analysis to evaluate the economic valuation assessment of Pattaya beach and Chalatat beach. The results showed that the beach values of Pattaya beach and Chalatat beach were 1,072,250 and 92,092 USD, respectively. The benefit-cost ratio analysis proposed that it is worth implementing beach nourishment for the adaptation measure to address all climate change scenarios. In response to climate change, recommendations could be applied to support beach tourism.	climate change; tidal correction; beach erosion; beach nourishment; seawall; coastal setback; pattaya beach; chalatat beach	2021	Fred	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763778	331934	2016.10830	Co-location of passive gear fisheries in offshore wind farms in the German EEZ of the North Sea: A first socio-economic scoping	Worldwide the renewable energy sector is expanding at sea to address increasing demands. Recently the race for space in heavily used areas such as the North Sea triggered the proposal of co-locating other activities such as aquaculture or fisheries with passive gears in offshore wind farms (OWFs). Our interdisciplinary approach combined a quantification of spatial overlap of activities by using Vessel Monitoring System and logbook data with a stakeholder consultation to conclude and verify on the actual feasibility of co-location. In the German Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the North Sea up to 90% of Danish and 40% of German annual gillnet fleet landings of plaice overlapped with areas where OWFs are developed. Our results indicated further that the international gillnet fishery could lose up to 50% in landings within the North Sea German EEZ when OWF areas are closed entirely for fisheries. No spatial overlap was found for UK potters targeting brown crab in the German EEZ. We further identified a number of key issues and obstacles that to date hinder an actual implementation of co-location as a measure in the marine spatial planning process: defining the legal base; implementation of safety regulations; delineation of minimum requirements for fishing vessels such as capacities, quotas, technical equipment; implementation of a licensing process; and scoping for financial subsidies to set up business. The stakeholder consultation verified the scientific findings and highlighted that all those points need to be addressed in a planning process. In the German EEZ we have shown that the socio-economic importance of spatial overlap varies within planning boundaries. Therefore we recommend an interdisciplinary bottom-up approach when scoping for suitable areas of co-location. Hence, an informed marine spatial planning process requires comprehensive and spatial explicit socio-economic viability studies factoring in also ecological effects of OWFs on target species.

91763780	10247	2020.1250	Shifting seas, shifting boundaries: Dynamic marine protected area designs for a changing climate	Marine protected areas (MPAs) are valuable tools for marine conservation that aim to limit human impacts on marine systems and protect valuable species or habitats. However, as species distributions shift due to ocean warming, acidification, and oxygen depletion from climate change, the areas originally designated under MPAs may bear little resemblance to their past state. Different approaches have been suggested for coping with species on the move in conservation. Here, we test the effectiveness of different MPA designs, including dynamic, network, and different directional orientations on protecting shifting species under climate change through ecosystem modeling in a theoretical ecosystem. Our findings suggest that dynamic MPAs may benefit some species (e.g., whiting and anchovy) and fishing fleets, and these benefits can inform the design or adaptation of MPAs worldwide. In addition, we find that it is important to design MPAs with specific goals and to account for the effects of released fishing pressure and species interactions in MPA design.

Nonetheless, there are approaches to alleviate the damaging effects of climate change in the region's fisheries sector. Using economic modeling, this paper estimates the economic costs of potential climate change adaptation strategies for the fisheries sector in Vanuatu and Timor-Leste through assessment of alternative future scenarios. Strategies include aquaculture development, natural resource management through establishment and/or expansion of marine protected areas, and deployment of low-cost inshore fish aggregating devices. Modeling results demonstrate that the above innovations will enable the two countries to significantly improve coastal and freshwater fish production in the medium-term (2035) and long-term (2050). Fish consumption is projected to grow due to population and income improvements; yet considerable increases in production will augment demand. Furthermore, national-level gains are projected from these adaptation strategies through fish exports. Improved production under climate change will require significant investments from the national governments of Vanuatu and Timor-Leste and/or private sectors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

91763808	992	2015.93	The state of the art in monitoring and verification-Ten years on	In the ten years since publication of the IPCC Special Report on CCS, there has been considerable progress in monitoring and verification (M\&V). Numerous injection projects, ranging from small injection pilots to much larger longer-term commercial operations, have been successfully monitored to the satisfaction of regulatory agencies, and technologies have been adapted and implemented to demonstrate containment, conformance, and no environmental impact. In this review we consider M\&V chiefly from the perspective of its ability to satisfy stakeholders that these three key requirements are being met. From selected project examples, we show how this was done, and reflect particularly on the nature of the verification process. It is clear that deep-focussed monitoring will deliver the primary requirement to demonstrate conformance and containment and to provide early warning of any deviations from predicted storage behaviour. Progress in seismic imaging, especially offshore, and the remarkable results with InSAR from In Salah are highlights of the past decade. A wide range of shallow monitoring techniques has been tested at many sites, focussing especially on the monitoring of soil gas and groundwater. Quantification of any detected emissions would be required in some jurisdictions to satisfy carbon mitigation targets in the event of leakage to surface: however, given the likely high security of foreseeable storage sites, we suggest that shallow monitoring should focus mainly on assuring against environmental impacts. This reflects the low risk profile of well selected and well operated storage sites and recognizes the over-arching need for monitoring to be directed to specific, measureable risks. In particular, regulatory compliance might usefully involve clearer articulation of leakage scenarios, with this specificity making it possible to demonstrate ``no leakage{''} in a more objective way than is currently the case. We also consider the monitoring issues for CO2-EOR, and argue that there are few technical problems in providing assurance that EOR sites are successfully sequestering CO2; the issues lie largely in linking existing oil and gas regulations to new greenhouse gas policy. We foresee that, overall, monitoring technologies will continue to benefit from synergies with oil and gas operations, but that the distinctive regulatory and certification environments for CCS may pose new questions. Overall, while there is clearly scope for technical improvements, more clearly posed requirements, and better communication of monitoring results, we reiterate that this has been a decade of significant achievement that leaves monitoring and verification well placed to serve the wider CCS enterprise.

91763835	3698	2020.462	Effective design of managed realignment schemes can reduce coastal flood risks	Managed realignment (MR) constitutes a form of nature-based adaptation to coastal hazards, including sea level rise and storm surges. The implementation of MR aims at the (re)creation of intertidal habitats, such as salt-marshes, for mitigating flood and erosion risks and for creating more natural shorelines. However, some evidence suggests that the desired coastal protection function of MR schemes (in terms of high water level (HWL) attenuation) may be limited and it was hypothesized that this was due to the configuration of the remaining seawalls, which we refer to as scheme design. Here we present the results of a hydrodynamic model application, which we used to analyse the effects of scheme design on within-site HWL attenuation by applying six scheme designs that differ in terms of breach characteristics and water storage capacity. In specific, we vary the configuration of the seaward defence line (including the seawall breaches) and the position of the landward dike by modifying the digital elevation model of the site. Our results show that changes in scheme design, particularly storage area and number and width of breaches, had significant effects on the site's HWL attenuation capacity. Decreasing the tidal prism by changing the number and size of breaches, with the site area kept constant, leads to increased modelled HWL attenuation rates. However, average HWL attenuation rates of >10 cm km(-1) are only achieved when site size increases. The mean high water depth of each scheme design scenario, calculated by dividing tidal prism by MR area, explains most of the variation in average HWL attenuation between all scenarios. Attention to potential within-site hydrodynamics at the design stage will aid the construction of more effective MR schemes with respect to coastal protection in the future.	coastal wetland; high water level attenuation; coastal restoration; managed realignment; de-embankment; coastal protection	2020	Fred	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763845	608	2021.77	Quantifying Uncertainty in Exposure to Coastal Hazards Associated with Both Climate Change and Adaptation Strategies: A US Pacific Northwest Alternative Coastal Futures Analysis	Coastal communities face heightened risk to coastal flooding and erosion hazards due to sea-level rise, changing storminess patterns, and evolving human development pressures. Incorporating uncertainty associated with both climate change and the range of possible adaptation measures is essential for projecting the evolving exposure to coastal flooding and erosion, as well as associated community vulnerability through time. A spatially explicit agent-based modeling platform, that provides a scenario-based framework for examining interactions between human and natural systems across a landscape, was used in Tillamook County, OR (USA) to explore strategies that may reduce exposure to coastal hazards within the context of climate change. Probabilistic simulations of extreme water levels were used to assess the impacts of variable projections of sea-level rise and storminess both as individual climate drivers and under a range of integrated climate change scenarios through the end of the century. Additionally, policy drivers, modeled both as individual management decisions and as policies integrated within adaptation scenarios, captured variability in possible human response to increased hazards risk. The relative contribution of variability and uncertainty from both climate change and policy decisions was quantified using three stakeholder relevant landscape performance metrics related to flooding, erosion, and recreational beach accessibility. In general, policy decisions introduced greater variability and uncertainty to the impacts of coastal hazards than climate change uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty across a suite of coproduced performance metrics can help determine the relative impact of management decisions on the adaptive capacity of communities under future climate scenarios.	coastal hazards exposure; alternative futures analysis; climate change; envision; coastal erosion; coastal flooding; tillamook county; oregon	2021	Fred	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763847	197710	2022.16790	Characteristics of Wind Resources and Post-Project Evaluation of Wind Farms in Coastal Areas of Zhejiang	As the onshore wind farm technology matures, offshore wind energy has attracted increasing attention. Zhejiang has coastal areas with massive potential for wind resources because of its geographical location. Therefore, understanding the wind resources in these areas can lay a foundation for future development and utilization. On this basis, this study used the measured wind field data of a wind farm along the coast of Zhejiang from March 2014 to February 2015 and from March 2016 to February 2018 to investigate and compare the characteristics of wind energy resources, including average wind speed, Weibull shape and scale factors, wind direction variation, and wind energy density. Then, the capacity coefficient of a wind turbine predicted using the wind farm data was compared with the actual capacity coefficients of two wind turbines in the wind farm in 2019. Results revealed the following observations: The overall variations in the evaluation indicators followed clear patterns over the 3 years. For example, the main wind direction in the same season was the same, and the variations in the monthly average wind speed, the monthly wind power density, and the theoretical capacity factors were highly similar. The time-series data indicated that the difference in the indicators between summer and autumn was significantly larger than that between other seasons, with the maximum difference in monthly average wind speed of 1.46 times and the maximum difference in monthly wind power density of 1.5 times. The comparison results of the capacity coefficient showed that the theoretical and actual capacity coefficients were extremely close when the monthly average wind speed was less than 6 m/s, with the average difference being less than 9\%. When the monthly average wind speed was greater than 6 m/s, the proximity between the theoretical and actual capacity coefficients was reduced, with an average difference of more than 9\% and a maximum value of 28\%. In general, the overall characteristics of wind resources in coastal areas of Zhejiang exhibited similar trends but fluctuated considerably in some months. Wind energy forecasts had significant discrepancies from the actual operation indicators of the wind farm when the wind speed was high.	wind energy characteristics; weibull distribution; wind power density; wind farm; capacity factor; post-project evaluation	2022	Fred	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763850	335451	2016.10707	Simulation of an offshore wind farm using fluid power for centralized electricity generation	A centralized approach for electricity generation within a wind farm is explored through the use of fluid power technology. This concept considers a new way of generation, collection and transmission of wind energy inside a wind farm, in which electrical conversion does not occur during any intermediate conversion step before the energy has reached the offshore central platform. A numerical model was developed to capture the relevant physics from the dynamic interaction between different turbines coupled to a common hydraulic network and controller. This paper presents two examples of the time-domain simulation results for an hypothetical hydraulic wind farm subject to turbulent wind conditions. The performance and operational parameters of individual turbines are compared with those of a reference wind farm with conventional technology turbines, using the same wind farm layout and environmental conditions. For the presented case study, results indicate that the individual wind turbines are able to operate within operational limits with the current pressure control concept. Despite the stochastic turbulent wind input and wake effects, the hydraulic wind farm is able to produce electricity with reasonable performance in both below and above rated conditions.	electric power generation;  electric power system interconnection;  electric utilities;  environmental technology;  fluid mechanics;  hydraulic motors;  stochastic systems;  time domain analysis;  torque;  wind power;  wind turbines, centralized approaches;  dynamic interaction;  electrical conversion;  electricity generation;  environmental conditions;  hydraulic networks;  operational parameters;  time-domain simulations, offshore wind farms	2016	Fred	NA	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91763864	6581	2016.510	Coastal Urban and Peri-Urban Indigenous People's Adaptive Capacity to Climate Change	This chapter discusses the adaptive capacity of coastal urban and peri-urban Indigenous People's to climate change. It is based on the findings of a National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) funded project that utilised a series of case studies that engaged key representatives from Indigenous organisations in five coastal locations in three states of south-eastern Australia (Low Choy D, Clarke P, Jones D, Serrao-Neumann S, Hales R, Koschade O et al., Aboriginal reconnections: understanding coastal urban and peri-urban Indigenous people's vulnerability and adaptive capacity to climate change, National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Gold Coast, 139 pp, 2013). The study has highlighted the social, economic and environmental impacts on urban and peri-urban Indigenous communities inhabiting coastal areas throughout south-eastern Australia. These impacts include a loss of community and environmental assets, such as cultural heritage sites, with significant impacts on their quality of life and the establishment of potential favourable conditions for the spread of plant diseases, weeds and pests. The study also found that opportunities did not readily exist for engagement with climate change adaptation policy and initiatives and this was further exacerbated by acute shortages of qualified/experienced Indigenous members that could represent their communities' interests in climate change adaptation forums. The evidence emerging from this research clearly demonstrates that Aboriginal people's consideration of the future, even with the overlay of climate change and the requirements for serious considerations of adaptation, are significantly influenced and dominated by economic aspirations which are seen as fundamental survival strategies for their communities. A number of specific climate change induced issues to emerge from the research included: the potential for Indigenous involvement in the `bush tucker' industry utilising wild plant species will potentially suffer from changes in species availability; concern was expressed about changes associated with peri-urban and urban development which appears to be escalating micro-environmental changes; peri-urbanisation is a major environmental change which threatens cultural assets including Aboriginal sites; Indigenous communities need representation in climate change adaptation forums and to be more directly involved in land and sea care projects. The chapter concludes with recommendations to better position Aboriginal engagement and knowledge systems in the wider climate change adaptation policy discourse.	climate change; peri-urbanization; micro-environmental change; aboriginals; indigenous communities	2016	Fred	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763865	8486	2021.1123	Empowering hope-based climate change communication techniques for the Gulf of Maine	The Gulf of Maine is one of the fastest warming marine areas on the planet: The industries and creatures that call it home face an unprecedented shift in their interactions and existence. Scientists, policy makers, and practitioners often want to communicate to the public about the seriousness of the situation to encourage mitigation and adaptation. Many standard communication strategies that rely on fear and scientific authority alone-rather than comprehensive explanations that include solutions-can leave audiences feeling overwhelmed and disengaged, instead of hopeful and motivated to act. In this practice bridge, we showcase a social science research-based climate change communication ``tool-kit{''} for the Gulf of Maine, using one example for each climate driver addressed at the Gulf of Maine 2050 Symposium (temperature and circulation: lobster fisheries; coastal and ocean acidification: seagrass restoration; sea-level rise: coastal development). Communication models that involve the head (understanding of climate change), heart (hope through agency and efficacy), and hands (intentions to participate in community action) further engagement in climate change conversations. We explain the research behind our communication framework, enabling practitioners to extend this case study to their own work.	climate change; communication; framing	2021	Fred	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763879	239977	2008.3386	Potential implications of sea-level rise for Poland	Poland's approximate 500-km coastline predominantly comprises sandy, low-lying beaches and populated coastal low lands. They are exposed to a range of threats from recently observed intensified climate changes and anticipated accelerated sea-level rise. Sediment starvation is already indicated by the growing necessity for dune and cliff protection that has been exacerbated by sea-level rise. The current study is both a summary and extension of existing Polish studies, and analyses current and predicted influences of accelerated sea-level rise on the coast. First, the Polish coast was divided into three areas according to coastal and socioeconomic characteristics. Then, considering two scenarios of accelerated sea-level rise {[}(i) 30 cm/100 y and (ii) 100 cm/100 y], an analysis of the threats of land loss and flood risk was carried out, and economic and social costs and losses assessed. This analysis included two adaptation scenarios: retreat (do nothing) and full protection. These analyses show that the greatest impacts of accelerated sea-level rise would occur in the far-eastern and western regions of the Polish coast with lesser impacts along the central region. Threatened areas include the conurbation of Gdansk, the Zulawy polders, and the low-lying areas around the Szczecin Lagoon and the Odra river mouth. Because both the Szczecin Lagoon region and the Vistula River delta are of key importance for the Polish economy and are densely populated, a carefully planned response is required to manage these threats.	baltic sea; coastline; coastline protection; flooding; erosion; vulnerability assessment	2008	Fred	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763883	152915	2016.9514	Cryobiology: principles, species conservation and benefits for coral reefs	Coral reefs are some of the oldest, most diverse and valuable ecosystems on Earth because they can support one-quarter of all marine life in our oceans. Despite their importance, the world's coral reefs continue to be degraded at unprecedented rates by local and global threats that are warming and creating a more acidic ocean. This paper explores the reproductive challenges of coral for ex situ conservation, using IVF and cryopreservation, and our practical biobanking methods. Coral present challenges for cryopreservation because their reproductive period is often limited to a few nights yearly, they are mostly hermaphrodites with diverse modes of reproduction, including asexual reproduction (i.e. fragmentation and parthenogenesis) and sexual reproduction (i.e. self-and cross-fertilisation) and they express physiological toxins that can inhibit cryopreservation. We have banked spermatozoa from 12 coral species using the same field-hardy methods and have created new coral with thawed spermatozoa. In addition, we describe the cryopreservation of coral symbionts, whose physiology only permits the highest success seasonally. As part of a multidisciplinary conservation strategy, these collections may provide a major hedge against extinction for corals facing the damaging effects of climate change and loss of genetic diversity, and promise to help offset threats to our reefs worldwide.	cryopreservation; spermatozoa; symbiodinium	2016	Fred	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763884	3252	2013.181	Forecasting the Effects of Coastal Protection and Restoration Projects on Wetland Morphology in Coastal Louisiana under Multiple Environmental Uncertainty Scenarios	Few landscape scale models have assessed the effects of coastal protection and restoration projects on wetland morphology while taking into account important uncertainties in environmental factors such as sea-level rise (SLR) and subsidence. In support of Louisiana's 2012 Coastal Master Plan, we developed a spatially explicit wetland morphology model and coupled it with other predictive models. The model is capable of predicting effects of protection and restoration projects on wetland area, landscape configuration, surface elevation, and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage under multiple environmental uncertainty scenarios. These uncertainty scenarios included variability in parameters such as eustatic SLR (ESLR), subsidence rate, and Mississippi River discharge. Models were run for a 2010-2060 simulation period. Model results suggest that under a ``future-without-action{''} condition (FWOA), coastal Louisiana is at risk of losing between 2118 and 4677 km(2) of land over the next 50 years, but with protection and restoration projects proposed in the Master Plan, between 40\% and 75\% of that loss could be mitigated. Moreover, model results indicate that under a FWOA condition, SOC storage (to a depth of 1 m) could decrease by between 108 and 250 million metric tons, a loss of 12\% to 30\% of the total coastwide SOC, but with the Master Plan implemented, between 35\% and 74\% of the SOC loss could be offset. Long-term maintenance of project effects was best attained in areas of low SLR and subsidence, with a sediment source to support marsh accretion. Our findings suggest that despite the efficacy of restoration projects in mitigating losses in certain areas, net loss of wetlands in coastal Louisiana is likely to continue. Model results suggest certain areas may eventually be lost regardless of proposed restoration investment, and, as such, other techniques and strategies of adaptation may have to be utilized in these areas.	wetland change; sea-level rise; surface elevation; soil organic carbon; marsh creation; diversions; coastal restoration; louisiana; wetland loss; coastal modeling	2013	Fred	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1

This paper investigates the effect of spatiotemporal complementarities of grid-connected offshore wind farms on operational cost and stability of meshed DC/AC grids with VSC-based MTDC networks. The investigation is carried out for a real power system in Jiangsu Province, China, and has used the real hourly wind data provided by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) in terms of the unit commitment (UC) as well as the probabilistic small-signal angular stability. Several distributed offshore wind farms are interconnected via a VSC-based MTDC network to send power to the southern area in Jiangsu Province. Computational results of the UC and system probabilistic stability demonstrate that significant saving of operational cost and stability improvement can be brought about from the complementarities of geographically distributed offshore wind farms.	wind power generation; power system stability; wind forecasting; costs; mathematical models; probabilistic logic; wind farms; wind power; complementarities; small-signal stability; unit commitment; mtdc; smoothing effect; monte carlo simulation	2022	Fred	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91763902	22721	2022.2732	Electric Power Integration Schemes of the Hybrid Fuel Cells and Batteries-Fed Marine Vessels-An Overview	Transportation electrification is undergoing a significant transition toward the utilization of efficient and reliable energy sources and smart integration schemes, where this transitioning is continuously facing ever-tightening challenges in order to comply with the increased environmental regulations. Among the different means of transportation, global maritime transport is responsible for 2\%-3\% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and it is predicted to increase to 17\% by 2050 if no changes are adapted. Hence, the international maritime organization (IMO) has targeted to reach a 50\% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 compared to 2008. Hence, alternative energy sources shall be utilized in order to meet these strict GHG emissions reduction targets, where battery- and hydrogen-fed fuel cells can play a vital role in such aspects. Since the output of these two energy sources is unregulated dc voltage, their connection to the whole ship power system can be accomplished in several ways, where each way has its features, in addition to utilizing different power conditioning stages (PCSs), and these features are not well clarified and compared in the literature. Hence, this article presents an overview of the possible integration schemes that can be utilized in fuel cell- and battery-fed vessels, which is supported with a comparative assessment. This is also presented along with highlighting the state-of-the-art PCSs that are available in the market and can be utilized in these integration schemes within marine vessels.

Although oyster reefs may not fall within the definition of â€œblue carbonâ€ as a vegetated coastal ecosystem, they may store as much carbon (C) as other well-studied coastal C sinks (e.g., mangroves, salt marshes, and sea grasses), providing an additional justification for restoration activities. Leveraging ongoing Crassostrea virginica reef restoration in Mosquito Lagoon, Florida (USA), this study employed a Before-After-Control-Impact sampling design to evaluate short-term (1Â yr) changes in sediment OC storage and flux, microbial activity, and microbial community composition on degraded, natural, and restored oyster reefs. Restored reefs exhibited the greatest change in OC cycling within the study year, with increases in dissolved OC (31%), particulate OC (97%), CO2 flux (707%), and Î²-glucosidase enzyme activity (467%), resulting in the highest total C and OC concentrations of the three reef types. Results demonstrate that sediment microbial community abundances are resilient and easily reinvigorated through reef restoration, while enzyme assays suggest sediment microbial activity on restored reefs may be limited by labile C availability. Overall, this study suggests restoration and oyster presence can rapidly enhance OC storage and can help offset the C flux from high calcification rates on young oyster reefs, providing an additional ecosystem service to support the importance of restoration activities.

91805339	213309	2020.16653	Marine stepping-stones: Connectivity of Mytilus edulis populations between offshore energy installations	Recent papers have suggested that epifaunal organisms use artificial structures as stepping-stones to spread to areas that are too distant to reach in a single generation. With thousands of artificial structures present in the North Sea, we test the hypothesis that these structures are connected by water currents and act as an interconnected reef. Population genetic structure of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, was expected to follow a pattern predicted by a particle tracking model (PTM). Correlation between population genetic differentiation, based on microsatellite markers, and particle exchange was tested. Specimens of M. edulis were found at each location, although the PTM indicated that locations >85 km offshore were isolated from coastal subpopulations. The fixation coefficient F-ST correlated with the number of arrivals in the PTM. However, the number of effective migrants per generation as inferred from coalescent simulations did not show a strong correlation with the arriving particles. Isolation by distance analysis showed no increase in isolation with increasing distance and we did not find clear structure among the populations. The marine stepping-stone effect is obviously important for the distribution of M. edulis in the North Sea and it may influence ecologically comparable species in a similar way. In the absence of artificial shallow hard substrates, M. edulis would be unlikely to survive in offshore North Sea waters.	connectivity; mytilus edulis; north sea; offshore installations; particle tracking models; stepping-stones	2020	Fred	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1
91805340	229638	2020.17852	A classification system for global wave energy resources based on multivariate clustering	Better understanding of the global wave climate is required to inform wave energy device design and large-scale deployment. Spatial variability in the global wave climate is analysed here to provide a range of characteristic design wave climates. K-means clustering was used to split the global wave resource into 6 classes in a device agnostic, data-driven method using data from the ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis product. Classification using two sets of input data were considered: a simple set (based on significant wave height and peak wave period) and a comprehensive set including a wide range of relevant wave climate parameters. Both classifications gave resource classes with similar characteristics; 55\% of tested locations were assigned to the same class. Two classes were low energy, found in enclosed seas and sheltered regions. Two classes were moderate wave energy classes; one swell dominated and the other in areas with wave action often generated by more local storms. Of the two higher energy classes; one was more often found in the northern hemisphere and the other, most energetic, predominantly on the tips of continents in the southern hemisphere. These classes match existing regional understanding of resource. Consideration of publicly available device power matrices showed good performance was primarily realised for the two highest energy resource classes (25-30\% of potential deployment locations); it is suggested that effort should focus on optimising devices for additional resource classes. The authors hypothesise that the low-risk, low variability, swell dominated moderate wave energy class would be most suitable for future exploitation.	wave energy; resource assessment; global; numerical model; k-means clustering	2020	Fred	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91760702	6212	2016.479	A typology of natural resource use for livelihood impact assessments in Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, Indonesia	The vulnerability of less developed regions is exacerbated by a lack of information to inform appropriate adaptation planning. We addressed this challenge in the islands of Lombok and Sumbawa (Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, Indonesia) by combining multiple sources of knowledge to develop a typology of natural resource use by communities of the province. This enabled an assessment of future impacts of drivers of change such as population growth and climate change. The typology was developed by cluster analysis of an inventory of the use of ecosystem goods and services (EGS) by the 105 rural subdistricts in the province. The data were largely elicited from expert knowledge, augmented by a rapid rural appraisal of communities' marine resource use in Sumbawa. Exploratory analysis of existing secondary data on livelihoods and land use provided context and skeleton data, which were developed further by experts. Overall, 82 EGS were identified from nine terrestrial, coastal, marine and freshwater habitats. EGS included livestock, cropping, forestry, wildlife hunting, fishing, aquaculture, mining, water (for drinking and agriculture) and tourism. The typology comprised seven types that captured 42\% of the variation in the data matrix. The types were moderately spatially aggregated and showed some congruence with administrative (district) boundaries. We discuss the implications of the results for planning livelihood adaptation strategies, and out-scaling these among subdistricts of matching types. (C) 2015 CSIRO.

If a shortcut between Asia and Europe via the Northern Sea Route (NSR) is adopted, significant energy saving and pollution reduction are possible compared with conventional southern routes. However, opinions in literature differ regarding this shortcut's economic viability. We present an analysis from the perspective of COSCO, China's largest container sea freight operator. We perform a cost-benefit analysis under several scenarios considering the following current realities: (1) declining oil prices not seen for decades, even lower than the lowest prices assumed in previous studies; (2) declining Russian NSR tariff as an effort to attract shipping traffic; (3) possible emission control areas along a northern route may require much cleaner energy and thus impact costs not studied in previous models; and (4) the capital cost difference between a hired and a self-owned vessel. Classical case studies of shipping routes between Shanghai and Rotterdam are adopted for comparison. We explain how different factors impact the shipping costs and to what extent can the NSR be economically viable. Occasional usage of NSR (e.g., one time transit) is unlikely to be more profitable given the higher unit transportation cost, but the route could be economically competitive in terms of the total profits earned for continuous usage. A more aggressive scenario which requires ships on the NSR to switch to much cleaner fuel would erode this route's competitiveness, but extra environmental benefits should be taken into consideration if future carbon emission trading schemes include the shipping industry.	arctic shipping; northern sea route; cost-benefit analysis; energy saving	2018	AC	NA	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is time to implement alternative adaptation and mitigation solutions. In developed countries there is a growing appreciation of the benefits of wetlands as a flood protection strategy, however, there is still need for further research on quantifying the benefits of these solutions to justify the investment and replicate them in developing countries. Therefore, using the City of Duran, Ecuador, as a case study, this research develops an approach on how to incorporate wetlands in hydrologic and hydraulic modelling to quantify peak flows' reduction and delineate different flood zone scenarios for the city. The results of this study underline the importance of carrying out additional research in quantifying the benefits of wetlands and other ecosystem-based solutions, using hydrologic and hydraulic models, as these can prove to be efficient and sustainable strategies to mitigate flooding.	climate change; ecosystem-based solutions; floods; hydrologic and hydraulic models; wetlands	2018	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

This study modified a model based on carbon balance to forecast carbon stored and CO2, CH4 emissions in four types of typical tidal flats-Phragmites australis (PA), Spartina alterniflora (SA), Suaeda japonica (SJ), and Bare Tidal Flat (BTF) in Korea's Ganghwa province from 2017 to 2047. The model was built using biomass data from salt plant species collected in different locations. The results indicate that the total annual simulated flow of CH4 increased over time in all four areas, most notably in SA, while CO2 remained relatively stable. The mean CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the four types of representative tidal flats were in the range of 0.03 to 19.1 mg m(-2) d(-1) and 0.007 to 5.23 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively, across all seasons. Besides, the results indicate that the amount of carbon accumulated in the top soil increases linearly over time in nearly all areas studied, ranging from 0.01 to 0.13 (kgC m(-2) yr(-1)). In general, the study provides a model for Korean tidal flats that incorporates carbon storage and GHG emissions in the intertidal zone in order to develop potential GHG reduction scenarios.	modelling; carbon storage; ghg emissions; tidal flats; carbon dynamics; coastal wetlands	2021	AC	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760720	13569	2019.1428	An economic evaluation of adaptation pathways in coastal mega cities: An illustration for Los Angeles	Sea level rise and uncertainty in its projections pose a major challenge to flood risk management and adaptation investments in coastal mega cities. This study presents a comparative economic evaluation method for flood adaptation measures, which couples a cost-benefit analysis with the concept of adaptation pathways. Our approach accounts for uncertainty in sea level rise projections by allowing for flexibility of adaptation strategies over time. Our method is illustrated for Los Angeles County which is vulnerable to flooding and sea level rise. Results for different sea level rise scenarios show that applying adaptation pathways can result in higher economic efficiency (up to 10\%) than individual adaptation strategies, despite the loss of efficiency at the initial strategy. However, we identified `investment tipping points', after which a transition could decrease the economic efficiencies of a pathway significantly. Overall, we recommend that studies evaluating adaptation strategies should integrate cost-benefit analysis frameworks with adaptation pathways since this allows for better informing decision makers about the robustness and economic desirability of their investment choices.

While existing literature has investigated ship energy efficiency from different perspectives, a comprehensive review on measures, practices, policies, feasibility, and alternatives remains absent. This study presents a retrospective review of ship energy efficiency literature by utilizing a hybrid review method that combines bibliometric and content analysis approaches. For bibliometric analysis, the bibliometrix package in the R software was used in combination with the VOSviewer software. The outcomes of bibliometric analysis are the most ranked articles, journals, authors, and institutions related to ship energy efficiency research. The bibliographic coupling analysis identified five research clusters: (1) decarbonization and emission reduction measures, (2) speed management, (3) policy and regulations, (4) economic and organizational factors, and (5) alternative energy sources. Future research directions are proposed for each cluster.

While most of existing studies focus on mapping the current state of adaptation plans, there is a significant lack of studies on the current implementation of adaptation strategies. This study addresses this challenge by assessing how coastal adaptation is being financed and implemented in Spain. In the absence of a detailed roadmap for implementing the Spanish Strategy for Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change, we have analysed how adaptation has been and is currently being funded; which the rationale for investments along the territory is; how adaptation investments compare to regular coastal protection costs; and assessed when implemented measures are really adaptation ones Our results show that the financing source clearly conditions the type of measures implemented, with those funded under the Environment Promotion Plan for Climate Change Adaptation (PIMA Adapta initiative) being dominated by classical coastal engineering actions, whereas ecosystem-related actions are mostly funded under the LIFE programme. In territorial terms, the Mediterranean coastal regions present the most important problems under current conditions and attract most of the funding. Most of the funded actions have been designed to solve current coastal problems, and although they indirectly contribute to adaptation by improving the coastal base status, they are not specifically designed for climate change. This misuse of the concept of adaptation measure will tend to the society to be overconfident about adopted actions whereas we are not progressing to real adaptation. To overcome this risk, it is necessary to have a clear roadmap for implementing adaptation measures together a proper financing structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It is projected to heavily impact agricultural and fishery sectors in Tuvalu, threatening food chains and the ability of Tuvaluans to produce and access safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary and cultural needs. In addition to climate change impacts, food security in Tuvalu is affected by a number of interconnected socio-economic, transboundary and ecosystem factors including access to land, traditional food-acquiring skills, food availability and affordability, cultural practices and the changing way of life. In fact, decline in traditional food-acquiring skills, the lack of interest in local food production practices, and other unfortunate socioeconomic circumstances continue adversely affecting food (in)security in Tuvalu. This study assessed the risk of climate change from the perspective of food security domain considering exposure to flood hazard. The results of risk assessment suggested that revival of traditional food-acquiring skills is an important adaptation strategy. Strategies at the community and government levels are proposed to prevent adverse impacts of flooding on and prevent food security in Tuvalu.	climate change risk; food (in)security; traditional food-acquiring skills; flood risk; transformative adaptation	2022	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1

In this article, a nonlinear finite-volume scheme is presented and applied to non-isothermal two-phase two-component flow in porous media. The idea of the scheme and the model used for the simulations are outlined and a comparison to a standard scheme used in industrial codes is made. Large-scale offshore CO2 storage in the Johansen formation serves as a benchmark problem, where it is demonstrated that the new scheme can handle highly complex corner-point grids and reproduces the physical processes with a higher accuracy than the standard discretization scheme.	finite-volume method; monotone discretization; corner-point grid; challenging grids	2017	AC	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

The methods were applied in Madagascar as a case study. The initiative centered on an exploratory research exercise in two communities in the south-west of Madagascar, a workshop held in Antananarivo in June 2016, combined with a component on communicating ocean science and climate change to stakeholders. It utilized innovative and rapid approaches to combine global and local skills and information on adaptation and resilience building, taking cognizance of national policies, and was based on the principles of a holistic, integrated and participatory approach. This paper summarizes the activities undertaken and assesses how effective they were in achieving the project goals, as well as presenting examples of the outputs obtained. The activities demonstrated the value of using existing high resolution global climate models for provision of information on future trends, and of including a traits-based ecological risk assessment as a standard component of vulnerability assessments. User-friendly qualitative modeling activities helped to consolidate holistic, integrated understanding of selected fisheries. The value of assessing the importance and resilience of supply chains and taking the local management measures and institutions into account were validated. The outcomes of the initiative reinforced the principle that the cumulative ecological and social impacts of individual stressors and drivers on marine-dependent communities must be addressed, including climate-change related stressors. Assessments of vulnerability and adaptation planning should be forward-looking and consider likely changes in the future. They must also be done with participation by local experts and stakeholders to ensure knowledge exchange, local capacity-building and ownership and that outputs are rooted in the local realities, are accepted as being legitimate, and reinforce and complement relevant legal frameworks and laws.	fishing communities; madagascar; climate change; vulnerability assessment; adaptation	2019	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1
91760771	48018	2014.2371	Climate Engineering: Economic Considerations and Research Challenges	Climate engineering measures are designed to either reduce atmospheric carbon concentration (by growing trees or spreading iron in the ocean, for example) or directly influence the radiation reaching or leaving the earth (by injecting sulfur into the stratosphere or modifying cloud formations, for example) to compensate for greenhouse gas-induced warming. The former measures are termed carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which we characterize as a low-leverage causative approach, and the latter are termed radiation management (RM), which we characterize as a high-leverage symptomatic approach. There are similarities between CDR and emission control. Accordingly, benefit-cost analysis can be used to assess certain CDR measures. By contrast, high-leverage RM represents a genuinely new option in the climate change response portfolio, at first glance promising insurance against fat-tail climate change risks. However, the persistent intrinsic uncertainties of RM suggest that any cautious climate risk management approach should consider RM as a complement to (rather than a substitute for) emission control at best. Moreover, the complexity of the earth system imposes major limitations on the ability of research to reduce these uncertainties. Thus we argue that a research strategy is needed that focuses on increasing our basic understanding of the earth system and conducting comprehensive assessments of the risk(s) associated with both climate change and the deployment of climate engineering.

91760772	1556	2020.209	The effects of depth and diet on red abalone growth and survival in cage mariculture at San Jeronimo Island, Baja California, Mexico	In recent decades, global abalone aquaculture has significantly increased, while wild abalone fishery landings have decreased drastically, shifting production from fishing to farming. In California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico), overfishing and climate change-linked diseases are thought to be responsible for mass mortalities and significant declines in abalone fisheries landings. Conservation aquaculture is an option for enhancing abalone populations through captive propagation and cage mariculture with subsequent restockings into the wild. To test, inform, and promote innovative sustainable seafood production strategies in the Northeastern Pacific, we designed an experimental mariculture system at San Jeronimo Island, Baja California. We explored the feasibility of rearing juvenile red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, in a near-shore mariculture cage-based production system to supply individuals for local restoration programs. We tested the effects of 2 different depths, surface and bottom (5 m), and 3 macroalgal diets (Macrocystis pyrifera, Eisenia arborea, and a mixed diet of Pelagophycus porra with M. pyrifera) on the survival and growth of juvenile red abalone (32 +/- 3.33 mm in shell length) inside cages attached to a long-line system. Over the 90-d experiment, survival was 99\% for the surface treatment and 95\% for the bottom treatment. Mean daily increment in shell length was 93 +/- 12 mu m.d(-1) in surface cages and 82 +/- 13 mu m.d(-1) in bottom cages. Depth did not affect growth or survival. Growth was highest using the E. arborea diet (99 +/- 7 mu m.d(-1)) but not significantly different from the M. pyrifera and mixed diets (88 +/- 10 and 74 +/- 13 mu m.d(-1), respectively). High survivorship and growth indicate that San Jeronimo Island can support cage-based mariculture of red abalone and that this strategy may be a useful tool in developing climate-resilient abalone restoration solutions aimed at bolstering seafood production.	conservation aquaculture; haliotis rufescens; climate change; restoration; macroalgae	2020	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760777	2944	2019.331	Strategic tourism management to address natural hazards in coastal areas: lessons from Buenos Aires, Argentina	Purpose The integral approach to risk is currently an important background for the local development processes within the sustaintability framework. Given the greater frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events in the period 2005-2015, whose inventory shows a total of 78 extreme climate events in the four thermal stations, the purpose of this paper is to analyze risk situations and their corresponding management in the tourist destinations (TD) of the Atlantic coast of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Design/methodology/approach Risk management in TDs has not been addressed in depth in the study area. Because of that, this study is exploratory and descriptive, and it was conducted by quantitative and qualitative methods. The occurrence of extreme weather events was the trigger of this study. Thereafter, the existence of risk situations was analyzed from the combination of natural hazards and material and human damage. The actions taken by the public sector were identified to make a diagnosis of the current management of coastal destinations in the province of Buenos Aires. Findings The result of this study shows that TDs do not apply integral models of risk management, as only 16\% of the total registered events were attended by public management from reactive measures to the event. It is believed possible to replicate this study in other TDs, regardless of its main tourism modality, as the analysis carried out in the coastal destinations of Buenos Aires shows that it is necessary to plan and manage risk to avoid and/or mitigate material, social and economic damages of the resident and tourist population. Practical implications The main implication of the study, in practical terms, is associated with the incorporation of specific equipment for the detection of storms and other meteorological phenomena. In addition, it should start, from the management, with a process of awareness of the resident and tourist population about the risk and its consequences. Social implications Knowing the existence of natural hazards is a strategic resource for public management. From the identification of the hazards, exposure and vulnerability of the population, it is possible to begin to take measures to mitigate the risk and conduct awareness campaigns about the risk situations that may arise from the occurrence of meteorological phenomena. in beach areas. In this sense, the development of a culture of risk is very important. Originality/value The relationship between the occurrence of extreme weather events and tourism has not been addressed in depth in Argentina. Therefore, this work provides an interdisciplinary vision (from tourism and physical geography) about the hazards that extreme phenomena represent in TDs, the situations of risk that they detaches there and the weakness of public management in coastal destinations of Buenos Aires. This case study shows that the absence of planning and risk management has serious implications for the continuity of the development processes of the destinations.	hazard; extreme weather events; coastal destination; strategic tourism management	2019	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760788	5408	2018.565	Developing signals to trigger adaptation to sea-level rise	Dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP) is emerging as a `fit-for-purpose' method for climate-change adaptation planning to address widening future uncertainty and long planning timeframes. A key component of DAPP is to monitor indicators of change such as flooding and storm events, which can trigger timely adaptive actions (change pathway/behavior) ahead of thresholds. Signals and triggers are needed to support DAPP-the signal provides early warning of the emergence of the trigger (decision-point), and the trigger initiates the process to change pathway before a harmful adaptation-threshold is reached. We demonstrate a new approach to designing signals and triggers using the case of increased flooding as sea level continues to rise. The flooding frequency is framed in terms of probable timing of several events reaching a specific height threshold within a set monitoring period. This framing is well suited to adaptive planning for different hazards, because it allows the period over which threshold exceedances are monitored to be specified, and thus allows action before adaptation-thresholds are reached, while accounting for the potential range of timing and providing a probability of premature warning, or of triggering adaptation too late. For our New Zealand sea level case study, we expect early signals to be observed in 10 year monitoring periods beginning 2021. Some urgency is therefore required to begin the assessment, planning and community engagement required to develop adaptive plans and associated signals and triggers for monitoring. Worldwide, greater urgency is required at tide-dominated sites than those adapted to large storm-surges. Triggers can be designed with confidence that a change in behavior pathway (e.g. relocating communities) will be triggered before an adaptation-threshold occurs. However, it is difficult to avoid the potential for premature adaptation. Therefore, political, social, economic, or cultural signals are also needed to complement the signals and triggers based on coastal-hazard considerations alone.	sea-level rise; storm-tide; coastal adaptation; dynamic adaptive policy pathways; flooding; inundation	2018	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
91760791	11498	2018.1161	Modeling alternative stable states in Caribbean coral reefs	The resilience of Caribbean coral reefs, which are an important source of biodiversity and provide essential ecosystem services, is constantly challenged by many reef stressors including ocean acidification, hurricane damage, and overharvesting of herbivorous reef fish. The presence of two alternative stable statesa desirable state with high levels of coral cover and its coral-depleted counterparthas been widely documented in the literature. Increasing coral resilience to prevent phase shifts to the undesirable state is a critical research priority, and mathematical models can serve as an important tool to not only better understand the underlying dynamics of observed coral communities, but also to evaluate the potential impacts of stressors and the outcome of management strategies designed to promote coral persistence. Here, we review the existing literature of mathematical models designed to understand the processes that generate alternative stable states. We focus on models that are comprised of ordinary differential equations and, at their core, capture algal-coral dynamics. Recommendations for Resource Managers Evidence for the existence of alternative stable states and the associated presence of hysteresis implies a need for management designed to increase the resilience of coral reef ecosystems. In addition, holistic approaches to designing management strategies are required to both increase resilience of coral reefs and maximize the benefits of the ecosystem services they provide. Due to the intrinsic complexity and spatial variability of coral reef ecosystems, management cannot be designed using a one size fits all approach. Instead, local dynamics and stressors need to be carefully considered.	community composition; hysteresis; phase shift; reef stressors	2018	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760794	57855	2015.3199	Elevated CO2 induces a bloom of microphytobenthos within a shell gravel mesocosm	The geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) is expected to be an important component of future global carbon emission mitigation, but there is a need to understand the impacts of a CO2 leak on the marine environment and to develop monitoring protocols for leakage detection. In the present study, sediment cores were exposed to CO2-acidified seawater at one of five pH levels (8.0, 7.5, 7.0, 6.5 and 6.0) for 10 weeks. A bloom of Spirulina sp. and diatoms appeared on sediment surface exposed to pH 7.0 and 7.5 seawater. Quantitative PCR measurements of the abundance of 16S rRNA also indicated an increase within the pH 7.0 and 7.5 treatments after 10 weeks incubation. More detailed analysis of the microbial communities from the pH 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0 treatments confirmed an increase in the relative abundance of Spirulina sp. and Navicula sp. sequences, with changes in the relative abundance of major archaeal and bacterial groups also detected within the pH 7.0 treatment. A decreased flux of silicate from the sediment at this pH was also detected. Monitoring blooms of microphytobenthos may prove useful as an indicator of CO2 leakage within coastal areas.	ccs; microphytobenthos; sediment; 16s rrna 454 pyrosequencing; quantitative pcr; nutrient fluxes	2015	AC	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760799	7833	2015.523	Adaptive capacity of co-management systems in the face of environmental change: The soft-shell clam fishery and invasive green crabs in Maine	Co-management, or regulatory decision-making through collaboration among user-groups, government officials, and scientists, has been proposed as an effective marine management tool in the face of environmental change. One potential advantage attributed to co-management is that such systems may have greater adaptive capacity than more conventional top-down management regimes. However, it is difficult to empirically test the relative adaptability of co-managed systems in the real world. This research uses a case study of the soft-shell clam fishery in Maine to investigate the question: Are co-managed systems better able to adapt to environmental change than are conventionally managed systems? This fishery provides an ideal system with which to address this question because (1) it is differentially managed, with some municipalities engaging in co-management and some in state management and (2) it faces an imminent environmental threat in the form of invasive predatory green crabs. This research first explores the scope of the green crab invasion in Maine, showing that although there have been no detectible impacts of green crabs on clam harvests to date, geographic overlaps of highly productive clam fisheries and high crab densities suggest a high likelihood of future impact. Second, to assess relative adaptability to this threat, this study quantifies differences between state- and co-managed systems across three attributes: user group stability, resource productivity, and institutional capacity to respond to change. It finds that co-managed clam fisheries have a higher degree of stability (i.e., a well defined user group), higher and more consistent productivity (i.e., more resources and incentives for sustained management), and greater institutional capacity to respond to change in the form of ``conservation hours,{''} a flexible management tool employed in co-managed fisheries. These results indicate that co-managed clam fisheries are better prepared to adapt to environmental change than are conventionally managed fisheries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

91760802	551	2021.66	At the Water's Edge: Coastal Settlement, Transformative Adaptation, and Well-Being in an Era of Dynamic Climate Risk	With accelerating climate change, US coastal communities are experiencing increased flood risk intensity, resulting from accelerated sea level rise and stronger storms. These conditions place pressure on municipalities and local residents to consider a range of new disaster risk reduction programs, climate resilience initiatives, and in some cases transformative adaptation strategies (e.g., managed retreat and relocation from highly vulnerable, low-elevation locations). Researchers have increasingly understood that these climate risks and adaptation actions have significant impacts on the quality of life, well-being, and mental health of urban coastal residents. We explore these relationships and define conditions under which adaptation practices will affect communities and residents. Specifically, we assess climate and environmental stressors, community change, and well-being by utilizing the growing climate change literature and the parallel social science literature on risk and hazards, environmental psychology, and urban geography work, heretofore not widely integrated into work on climate adaptation.	coastal communities; dynamic risk and response; stressors; well-being; climate adaptation	2021	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
91760803	35468	2021.3711	Cenosphere formation of heavy fuel oil/water emulsion combustion in a swirling flame	Heavy fuel oil (HFO) is a good alternative and economical fuel for power generation and marine transport industry because of its low price and high energy density. However, HFO's incomplete and complex combustion results in high levels of emissions. One way to improve HFO combustion and reduce its high-level pollutant emissions is by emulsifying HFO with water to form water-in-oil emulsion fuel by virtue of its characteristic of the micro-explosion phenomenon of emulsion fuel. In this work, we tested HFO samples with water contents of 0\% (normal HFO), 5\%, 10\%, 20\%, and 30\% in mass. A lab-scale burner with an air-blast nozzle and swirling airflow was applied to simulate the industrial boiler's typical features. The properties of various water contents emulsion fuel, including composition, water droplet size distribution, heating value, density, viscosity, and TGA were analyzed. The influence of water-HFO emulsion on the swirling flame combustion performance and the primary pollutant emissions, listed as CO, CO2, NOx, SOx, particulate matter (PM), and its composition, was studied. The results show that, in general, multiple various beneficial processes come into effect when water-in-HFO emulsion augments the combustion. HFO emulsion technology offers tremendous potential to enhance combustion processes' efficiency with reduced SOx, NOx, and particulate matter emissions. The emulsion fuel has a considerable effect on the formation process of cenospheres. This effect varies with different water levels in HFO due to the different intensities of secondary atomization of emulsion fuel combustion.	cenospheres; emulsion fuel; swirling flame; heavy fuel oil	2021	AC	NA	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760810	42597	2022.4360	Sea level rise will change estuarine tidal energy: A review	Climate change induced sea level rise (SLR) is likely to impact estuarine hydrodynamics and associated processes, including tidal energy. In this study, a hierarchy of factors influencing the future of estuarine tidal energy resources is proposed based on their relevance to SLR. These include primary factors (e.g., tidal prism, tidal range, tidal current, tidal asymmetry), secondary factors (e.g., sediment transport), and tertiary factors (e.g., shifts in estuarine shape/landform). The existing uncertainty regarding SLR impacts on tidal energy resource is high, given the spatial variability of estuaries. SLR may cause tidal ranges or currents to strengthen or weaken, depending on estuarine shape and boundary conditions (e.g., presence or absence of levees and adjacent low-lying areas). To date, local site studies have not resulted in an overarching assessment of SLR effects on tidal energy resources and comparative studies encompassing different regions and estuary types are recommended in order to address the existing knowledge gaps and provide insights for policymakers and stakeholders. SLR implications to estuarine tidal energy resources may be particularly important as SLR-induced changes can alter the available resource within a renewable energy development's operational lifetime (-20-30 years for tidal stream devices and-120 years for tidal barrages). In this regard, broader environmental impacts, as well as technoeconomic assessments, are difficult to predict and long-term management decisions associated with harnessing the potential of tidal energy schemes within estuaries should be made with caution.	tidal power; tidal dynamics; tidal stream turbine; tidal barrage; renewable energy; climate change	2022	AC	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Harvesting gas turbine heat by organic Rankine bottoming cycles has raised as a potential solution to cut carbon dioxide emissions in offshore oil and gas installations. Offshore power cycles are expected to operate most of their operational life at part-loads where they suffer from poor efficiency. The purpose of this article is to boost the part-load efficiency of offshore organic Rankine cycles and keep it as close as possible to the design value. Here an operational strategy based on cooling water flow control is developed and added to a sliding pressure control logic and a variable area nozzle turbine control strategy. An in-house tool is developed for the design of organic Rankine cycles and the simulation of off-design control strategies. A design methodology is presented to optimize the cycle power output while minimizing the cycle footprint offshore. The proposed control strategy was successful in keeping the part-load efficiency close to design value and achieving a 5% reduction of annual carbon dioxide emissions.

91760818	48026	2016.2955	Mangrove Range Expansion Rapidly Increases Coastal Wetland Carbon Storage	The climate change-induced expansion of mangroves into salt marshes could significantly alter the carbon (C) storage capacity of coastal wetlands, which have the highest average C storage per land area among unmanaged terrestrial ecosystems. Mangrove range expansion is occurring globally, but little is known about how these rapid climate-driven shifts may alter ecosystem C storage. Here, we quantify current C stocks in ecotonal wetlands across gradients of marsh- to mangrove-dominance, and use unique chronological maps of vegetation cover to estimate C stock changes from 2003 to 2010 in a 567-km(2) wildlife refuge in the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. We report that over the 7-yr. period, total wetland C stocks increased 22 \% due to mangrove encroachment into salt marshes. Newly established mangrove stands stored twice as much C on a per area basis as salt marsh primarily due to differences in aboveground biomass, and mangrove cover increased by 69 \% during this short time interval. Wetland C storage within the wildlife refuge increased at a rate of 2.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr.(-1), more than doubling the naturally high coastal wetland C sequestration rates. Mangrove expansion could account for a globally significant increase of terrestrial C storage, which may exert a considerable negative feedback on warming.	climate change; range expansion; ecotone; carbon storage; mangrove; salt marsh	2016	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It has been forecasted that if the worst predictions regarding climate change and sea level rise become reality atolls around the world could become submerged in the future. This would render them uninhabitable and could lead to questions about whether Atoll Island States could still be considered as States. The international community has been avoiding any commitment to create a convention that would protect people displaced by climate change. In order to solve such potential problems, the authors will argue that a framework of bilateral agreements, initiatives, and national policies could constitute a viable solution for the various interested parties. The article will discuss the characteristics of Atoll Island States, touching on possible solutions for climate change displacement which have been discussed by the governments and civil society of the affected States.

Coastal foredunes represent the most important natural flood barriers along coastlines worldwide, but their area has been squeezed dramatically because of a continuing urbanization of coastlines, especially in Europe. Dune development is steered by the development of vegetation in interaction with sand fluxes from the beach. Marram grass (Calamagrostis arenaria, formerly Ammophila arenaria) is the main dune building species along most European coasts, but also in other continents where the species was introduced. Engineering of coastal dunes, for instance by building dunes in front of dikes, needs to be based on a solid understanding of the species' interactions with the environment. Only quantitative approaches enable the further development of mechanistic models and coastal management strategies that encapsulate these biomorphogenic interactions. We here provide a quantitative review of the main biotic and physical interactions that affect marram grass performance, their interactions with sand fluxes and how they eventually shape dune development.

This paper proposes a distributed optimal voltage control and berth allocation strategy to mitigate voltage violations while balancing the benefits between microgrids and AES. The voltage control problem is formulated as a second-order cone program (SOCP) to minimize network power loss, while the berth allocation problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to minimize total service time. To build the bridge between microgrids and berthed-in AES, the power interaction model at the seaport is proposed. The proposed model introduces a time-cost factor to evaluate the economic cost of service time and also unifies the timescales between voltage control and berth allocation. Considering different system operators and objectives of microgrids and AES, this paper develops an alternating direction of multipliers (ADMM)-based distributed optimization algorithm to solve the problem. The method can help reach the convergence of ADMM in solving models with discrete variables. The proposed approach is tested on the EU 16-bus microgrid embedded with a seaport and simulation results verify the effectiveness both in mitigating voltage violations and maximizing the total benefits of microgrids and AES.	microgrids; voltage control; resource management; seaports; optimization; marine vehicles; process control; distributed optimization; voltage control; berth allocation; all-electric ships; alternating direction of multipliers	2022	AC	NA	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760832	13844	2020.1717	Understanding the limitations of current RFMO climate change adaptation strategies: the case of the IATTC and the Eastern Pacific Ocean	While Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) face many challenges in their pursuit of sustainable resource development, climate change is among the most pressing and least addressed. Research has identified a host of expected or ongoing physical, biological, ecological, and social impacts of climate change on the marine environment, creating a strong climate change adaptation imperative for RFMOs. Through a case study of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), we describe two serious limitations of current RFMO climate change adaptation strategies: (1) a weakened efficacy of resource management and conservation policies caused by viewing climate change as a general climate stressor rather than a unique environmental challenge, and (2) a reliance on incremental policy reform, problematic because it may not enable a pace or scale of policy change proportional to the sustainable development challenges created by a rapidly changing ocean. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of incrementalism and outline potential solutions to the environmental and structural challenges facing the IATTC and other RFMOs, including the concept of adaptation pathways.	rfmo; climate change; adaptive management; fisheries management; conservation; iattc	2020	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760833	1309	2019.148	Nature-based solutions for hydro-meteorological hazards: Revised concepts, classification schemes and databases	Hydro-meteorological hazards (HMHs) have had a strong impact on human societies and ecosystems. Their impact is projected to be exacerbated by future climate scenarios. HMHs cataloguing is an effective tool to evaluate their associated risks and plan appropriate remediation strategies. However, factors linked to HMHs origin and triggers remain uncertain, which pose a challenge for their cataloguing. Focusing on key HMHs (floods, storm surges, landslides, droughts, and heatwaves), the goal of this review paper is to analyse and present a classification scheme, key features, and elements for designing nature-based solutions (NBS) and mitigating the adverse impacts of HMHs in Europe. For this purpose, we systematically examined the literature on NBS classification and assessed the gaps that hinder the widespread uptake of NBS. Furthermore, we critically evaluated the existing literature to give a better understanding of the HMHs drivers and their interrelationship (causing multi-hazards). Further conceptualisation of classification scheme and categories of NBS shows that relatively few studies have been carried out on utilising the broader concepts of NBS in tackling HMHs and that the classification and effectiveness of each NBS are dependent on the location, architecture, typology, green species and environmental conditions, as well as interrelated non-linear systems. NBS are often more cost-effective than hard engineering approaches used within the existing systems, especially when taking into consideration their potential co-benefits. We also evaluated the sources of available data for HMHs and NBS, highlighted gaps in data, and presented strategies to overcome the current shortcomings for the development of the NBS for HMHs. We highlighted specific gaps and barriers that need to be filled since the uptake and upscaling studies of NBS in HMHs reduction is rare. The fundamental concepts and the key technical features of past studies reviewed here could help practitioners to design and implement NBS in a real-world situation.	climate change; green; blue and hybrid infrastructure; cost effectiveness; floods; droughts; heatwaves	2019	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760836	12196	2017.991	Planning for the future: Incorporating global and local data to prioritize coral reef conservation	It is necessary, yet challenging, to manage coral reefs to simultaneously address a suite of global and local stressors that act over the short and long term. Therefore, managers need practical guidance on prioritizing the locations and types of conservation that most efficiently address their goals using limited resources. This study is one of the first examples of a vulnerability assessment for coral reefs that uses downscaled global climate change projections and local anthropogenic stress data to prioritize coral reef locations for conservation investment. Vulnerability was separated into manageable and unmanageable components (bleaching likelihood and local anthropogenic stressors, respectively), and the highest priority was given to places with low levels of unmanageable threats and high levels of manageable threats. Following prioritization, resilience characteristics were derived from standard reef monitoring data and used to identify the specific conservation strategies most likely to succeed given local ecological conditions and threats. Using Indonesian coral reefs as a case study, 9.1\% of total coral reef area was identified as of high conservation priority, including parts of Raja Ampat, Sulawesi, and Sumatra that are not currently included in marine protected areas (MPAs). Existing MPAs tend to be located in areas less threatened by local-scale anthropogenic activities, which has implications for both the implementation costs and the likely impact of conservation investment. This approach employs common and publicly available data and can therefore be replicated wherever managers face the familiar challenge of allocating limited conservation resources in the face of rapid global change and uncertainty.	climate change; decision science; exposure; indonesia; marine protected area; prioritization; resilience; vulnerability	2017	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760840	5185	2021.692	Assessing social-ecological vulnerability of coastal systems to fishing and tourism	Detecting areas with high social-ecological vulnerability (SEV) is essential to better inform management interventions for building resilience in coastal systems. The SEV framework, developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is a robust method to identify SEV of tropical coastal systems to climate change. Yet, the application of this framework to temperate regions and other drivers of change remains underexplored. This study operationalizes the SEV framework to assess the social-ecological implications of fishing and tourism in temperate coastal systems. We spatially represented the SEV of coastal systems and identified the social and ecological vulnerability dimensions underpinning this SEV. Our results demonstrate that different dimensions contribute differently to the SEV, suggesting the need for distinctive management intervention to reduce the vulnerability of coastal systems. Our findings also highlight that livelihood diversification and the protection of marine areas may be plausible strategies to build resilience in temperate coastal systems that face fishing and tourism pressures. With this study, we hope to encourage the application of the SEV framework to other drivers of change for building more resilient coastal systems. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

The stability of the deepsea has allowed the evolution of species ill-equipped to withstand rapid environmental changes. Low metabolic rates of most deep-sea species are correlated with low capacities for pH buffering and low concentrations of ion-transport proteins. Changes in seawater carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco(2)) may thus lead to large cellular Pco(2) and pH changes. Oxygen transport proteins of deepsea animals are also highly sensitive to changes in pH. Acidosis leads to metabolic suppression, reduced protein synthesis, respiratory stress, reduced metabolic scope and, ultimately, death. Deep-sea CO2 injection as a means of controlling atmospheric CO2 levels should be assessed with careful consideration of potential biological impacts. In order to properly evaluate the risks within a relevant timeframe, a much more aggressive approach to research is warranted.	carbon dioxide; global warming; deep sea; hypercapnia; acid-base balance; sequestration; cephalopoda; metabolism	2003	AC	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Delta City Rotterdam, with one of the biggest ports in the world, is dealing with the consequences of climate change in a very pro-active and smart way, turning challenges into opportunities. The RCP Rotterdam Climate Proof program aims at making the city completely climate resilient by 2025, by building multifunctional flood protection and innovative water storage for urban drain water. But also by kicking-off a Rotterdam Adaptation Strategy RAS, by using new smart technologies like Apps and serious gaming, and by redeveloping and revitalizing its old city ports areas with attractive waterfronts. At these waterfronts, where education of future generations is combined with innovative and sustainable development of businesses, best practices are showcased to make the city more attractive, to add economic value and to create resilient communities. This knowledge and experience is shared with other delta and coastal cities in the world, in the `Connecting Delta Cities' global network, and with the Rockefeller Foundation 100 Resilient Cities initiative. This article explains that dealing with climate change in a pro-active and smart way creates opportunities for attractive, resilient and economically strong delta cities of the future.	adaptation; cities; climate change; deltas; innovations	2015	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760854	317253	2019.6233	Field-based numerical model investigation of wave propagation across marshes in the Chesapeake Bay under storm conditions	Saltmarshes have the potential to protect coastal communities from the impact of waves caused by severe storms. While recent developments in numerical models are enhancing the simulation of wave-vegetation interactions, the estimation of the drag coefficient (C d ), used to account for the reduction of wave energy by vegetation, is still a source of uncertainty. In this study, we use a unique combination of field measurements (wave parameters, topo-bathymetric survey and vegetation characteristics) and numerical modelling (XBeach) to evaluate the significance of C d for calculating wave attenuation by vegetation, and ultimately, improve the representation of the wave propagation across these ecosystems. Wave height propagation simulated by five empirical C d formulations, including Jadhav, 2012, Anderson and Smith, 2014, Garzon, 2018 (based on Reynolds [Re] and Keulegan-Carpenter [KC] numbers) and Ozeren et al., 2014, was evaluated by comparing against wave heights collected at different locations of two saltmarshes of the Chesapeake Bay during two different storms. This analysis revealed that: 1) Garzon, 2018 (based on Re number) and Anderson and Smith, 2014 formulations provided the most reliable results (relative bias lower than 20%), especially at the first 100 m across the vegetation field; 2) Results provided by Garzon, 2018) (based on KC) formulation yielded relative bias lower than 30%, and it mainly overestimated wave heights; 3) Jadhav, 2012 simulations clearly underestimated wave heights, showing relative bias up to âˆ’60%; and 4) Ozeren et al., 2014 (currently implemented in the model) simulations highly overestimated wave heights over the marsh field and displayed a large scatter. Finally, the validated formulation (Garzon, 2018; based on Re number) and vegetation characteristic measurements collected during the fall and winter were employed to explore the seasonal coastal protection variability of these saltmarshes. Our simulations indicated that under similar hydrodynamic conditions, marshes offered between 15% and 30% less protection against waves in the winter than in fall. However, while saltmarshes would provide additional coastal protection from hurricanes in comparison to nor'easters (cool-season extratropical cyclones), we demonstrated that the marshes still offer more protection than non-vegetated fields in both seasons in these locations.

91760861	144	2019.11	Climate vulnerability, impacts and adaptation in Central and South America coastal areas	Low-Elevation Coastal Zones in Central and South America are exposed to climate-related hazards (sea-level rise, climate variability and storms) which threaten the assets (people, resources, ecosystems, infrastructure, and the services they provide), and are expected to increase due to climate change. A non-systematic review is presented focusing on vulnerability elements, impacts, constraints to adaptation, and their possible strategies. The analysis emphasises the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Reasons for Concern (e.g., threatened systems, extreme events, aggregated impacts, and critical thresholds), particularly on sea-level rise, degradation of mangroves, and invasive alien species in Central and South America focusing on case studies from Uruguay and Venezuela. Despite recent advances in coastal adaptation planning in Central and South America, there is an adaptation deficit in the implementation of measures and strategies against climate-related hazards, such as sea-level rise. Adaptation constraints are linked with poverty, resource allocation, lack of political will, and lack of early warning systems for climate-related hazards. Non-structural adaptation measures such as community-based adaptation and ecosystem-based adaptation are not fully mainstreamed into national plans yet. Government-level initiatives (e.g. National Adaptation Programmes of Action) are being developed, but a few are already implemented. In addition to specific thematic measures, the implementation of non-structural approaches, National Adaptation Programmes of Action and early warning systems, based on the reasons for concern, should foster adaptive capacity in coastal areas.

91760862	12085	2014.656	Urban planning and sustainable adaptation to sea-level rise	Sea-level rise poses major challenges to coastal land uses, and therefore to urban planning processes. In theory, if done well, urban planning can lead to responses to sea-level rise that are socially and environmentally sustainable. In practice, urban planning processes may fall short of this ideal. We use multiple methods to describe and analyse how urban planning processes have led to adaptation to sea-level rise in Lakes Entrance in Victoria, Australia. Adaptation has principally taken the form of restrictions on development on low-lying land. In this town, which is considered particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise, the urban planning process and its outcomes have been controversial and divisive. Policies at the state level were imposed rapidly on this particular local community, and were later applied across the state. Our findings support the emerging consensus that to be sustainable, urban planning needs to: facilitate local ownership of adaptation responses; build collective action within local communities and between local communities and different arms and levels of government; and be fair in its application across space and over time. Addressing these social, dimensions of adaptation takes time, but they are a sine qua non of sustainable adaptation to sea-level, rise. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The reserve is a world heritage site and the last refuge for the endangered Bengal tiger at a crucial time when global climate change threatens their existence. The mangrove ecosystem and wildlife conservation have become the priority for the state government of West Bengal. However, in becoming so, the state government imposes restrictions on catching fish in the core and buffer areas of the biosphere reserve, which intensify fishermen's everyday resource-access struggles in the mangrove forest. This paper examines the conflict between local fishermen and conservation needs, broadening the understanding of human-environment relationships in the Sundarbans region of India.	fisherfolk; india; resource-access struggles; sundarban biosphere reserve	2015	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91760877	256575	2018.2780	Tree biomass quantity, carbon stock and canopy correlates in mangrove forest and land uses that replaced mangroves in Honda Bay, Philippines	Mangrove forests are important carbon (C) sinks in the tropics that are threatened by tropical deforestation and land use conversion, especially in Southeast Asia. Yet quantitative estimates are limited on the biomass (i.e. aboveground, belowground, downed woody debris) and tree C stocks of secondary, and converted mangroves in Southeast Asia. While some related studies have been conducted in Latin America and Central Asia, there is a need to assess different geographical areas and regional ecosystems, as well as to consider the impacts of mangrove conversion to other land use types. In this study, tree biomass and tree C stocks of secondary mangrove forests and four types of land uses that replaced intact mangrove forests (abandoned aquaculture pond, abandoned salt pond, coconut plantation, and cleared mangroves) in the coast of Honda Bay, Philippines were quantified. Their relationships with selected canopy variables were evaluated. Our measurements revealed that mean tree biomass (Â±SE) of intact mangroves ranged from 22.4 Â± 9.0 to 178.1 Â± 32.0 Mg haâˆ’1, which store 10â€“80 MgC haâˆ’1 (mean: 47.9 Â± 5.1 MgC haâˆ’1). Leaf Area Index correlated with mangrove tree biomass C stock (r=0.67, p&lt;0.05). In contrast, the biomass and tree C stock of the replacement land uses ranged from 0.1 Â± 0 Mg haâˆ’1 and 0.12 Â± 0.1 MgC haâˆ’1, respectively, in the abandoned aquaculture ponds to 12.0 Â± 4.0 Mg haâˆ’1 and 5.7 Â± 1.5 MgC haâˆ’1 in coconut plantation. Our results indicate the importance of mangroves in storing considerable amounts of C in tree biomass in the coastal area, and the C losses (46.5 Mg C haâˆ’1 or 97% decline) in tree C stocks from conversion of mangroves to other land uses.

91760878	13658	2021.1861	The Impact of Climate Change Adaptation Strategies on Income and Food Security: Empirical Evidence from Small-Scale Fishers in Indonesia	The impacts of climate change on marine capture fisheries have been observed in several studies. It is likely to have a substantial effect on fishers' income and food security. This study aims to estimate the impact of adaptation strategies on fishers' income and their household's food security. Data were collected from small-scale fishers' households, which own a fishing boat smaller or equal to five gross tonnages (GT). The study sites were the two coastal regions of Malang and Probolinggo in East Java, Indonesia, due to the meager socioeconomic resources caused by climate change. A probit regression model was used to determine the factors influencing the fishers' adaptation. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to evaluate the impact of the adaptation strategies on income and food security. Food security was measured by food consumption score (FCS). The findings indicated that participation in the fishers' group affected adaptation strategies significantly, and so did the access to credit and climate information. Also, PSM showed that the adaptation strategies had a positive and significant impact on fishers' income and food security. Those who applied the adaptation strategies had a higher income and FCS than those who did not. This finding implies that the fishery sector's adaptation strategies can have significant expansion outcome and reduce exposure to risks posed by climate change. Therefore, the arrangement of more climate change adaptation strategies should be promoted by the government for small-scale fishers in Indonesia.	capture fisheries; east java; food consumption score; probit regression; propensity score matching	2021	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
91760879	1986	2012.88	Is Canada fulfilling its obligations to sustain marine biodiversity? A summary review, conclusions, and recommendations	Canada has made numerous national and international commitments to sustain marine biodiversity. Given current and potential threats to biodiversity from climate change, fisheries, and aquaculture, we provide a summary review of Canada's progress in fulfilling its obligations to protect, conserve, recover, and responsibly exploit marine biodiversity. We conclude that Canada has made little substantive progress, when compared to most developed nations, in meeting its biodiversity commitments. Much of Canada's policy and rhetoric has not been operationalised, leaving many of the country's national and international obligations unfulfilled in some key areas, such as the establishment of marine protected areas and incorporation of the precautionary approach to fisheries management. We conclude that regulatory conflict within Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) and the absolute discretion exercised by the national Minister of Fisheries and Oceans contribute significantly to an unduly slow rate of policy and statute implementation. We recommend new approaches and measures to sustain Canadian marine biodiversity and new research initiatives to support scientific advice to decision-makers. Many recommendations focus on management actions required to meet existing commitments to biodiversity conservation. Overall, we conclude that the most effective strategy is to protect existing biological diversity and to rebuild depleted populations and species to restore natural diversity. By improving and protecting the biodiversity in Canada's oceans, such a strategy will restore the natural resilience of Canada's ocean ecosystems to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change and other anthropogenic activities with consequent long-term benefits for food security and social and economic well-being.	policy; statute; fisheries; marine protected area; precautionary approach	2012	AC	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0

Youth have been identified as an at-risk population, with likely impacts on mental health and well-being. This study identifies and characterizes youth-specific protective factors that enhance well-being in light of a rapidly changing climate, and examines how climatic and environmental change challenges these. In-depth conversational interviews were conducted with youth aged 15-25 from the five communities of the Nunatsiavut region of Labrador, Canada: Nain, Hopedale, Postville, Makkovik, and Rigolet. Five key protective factors were identified as enhancing their mental health and well-being: being on the land; connecting to Inuit culture; strong communities; relationships with family and friends; and staying busy. Changing sea ice and weather conditions were widely reported to be compromising these protective factors by reducing access to the land, and increasing the danger of land-based activities. This study contributes to existing work on Northern climate change adaptation by identifying factors that enhance youth resilience and, if incorporated into adaptation strategies, may contribute to creating successful and effective adaptation responses.

91760894	252291	2022.2856	Are shore power and emission control area policies always effective together for pollutant emission reduction? - An analysis of their joint impacts at the post-pandemic era	Shore power (SP) and emission control area (ECA) have been two of the main polices for a green maritime logistics. However, it is still not clear how the joint impact of these two polices will influence vessels' shipping and energy consumption plan. The influence could be more complicated at the post-pandemic era of COVID-19 when the vessel's refueling could be risky. This paper develops mathematical model of the vessel's routing and fuel inventory decisions by considering both the SP and ECA. Based on the model, we analyze the optimal decision of a vessel under three different policy conditions, which are non-SP, compulsive utilization of SP at all ports, and optional SP utilization by the vessel. The numerical experiments are conducted based on the information of a vessel delivering cargos along the coastline in China. The results uncover a novel phenomenon that the implementation of the SP might incentive the vessel to travel longer distance outside the ECA for a lower total cost that results in more pollutant emissions. We show that the SP policy would influence the vessel's fuel management and refueling times which can change the route of vessel sailing inside and outside ECAs. Sensitivity analysis also shed light on how the government's decision on the SP policy may influence the overall pollutant emissions of the vessel from both berthing at ports and sailing on the sea. We discussed how the fixed cost of refueling, which is affected by the risk of the COVID-19 condition, will influence the vessel's plan under the SP and ECA polices. This study suggests the government to make an integrated policy of both SP and ECA at the post-pandemic era to achieve an overall reduction of the pollutant emission.

Most conservation efforts occur at local scales and, when effective, can increase the resilience of coral reefs to global threats such as climate change (e.g. warming water and ocean acidification). Limited resources for conservation require that we efficiently prioritize where and how to best sustain coral reef ecosystems. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we develop the first prioritization approach that can guide regional-scale conservation investments in land-and sea-based conservation actions that cost-effectively mitigate threats to coral reefs, and apply it to the Coral Triangle, an area of significant global attention and funding. Using information on threats to marine ecosystems, effectiveness of management actions at abating threats, and the management and opportunity costs of actions, we calculate the rate of return on investment in two conservation actions in sixteen ecoregions. We discover that marine conservation almost always trumps terrestrial conservation within any ecoregion, but terrestrial conservation in one ecoregion can be a better investment than marine conservation in another. We show how these results could be used to allocate a limited budget for conservation and compare them to priorities based on individual criteria. Conclusions/Significance: Previous prioritization approaches do not consider both land and sea-based threats or the socioeconomic costs of conserving coral reefs. A simple and transparent approach like ours is essential to support effective coral reef conservation decisions in a large and diverse region like the Coral Triangle, but can be applied at any scale and to other marine ecosystems.

91760896	14068	2020.1743	Prioritising resilience policies to reduce welfare losses from natural disasters: A case study for coastal Bangladesh	Quantified flood risk assessments focus on asset losses, neglecting longer-term impacts to household welfare via income and consumption losses. The extent of welfare losses depends upon resilience - the ability to anticipate, resist, cope, recover and learn from a shock. Here, we use a novel welfare loss modelling framework and perform a high-resolution spatial analysis in coastal Bangladesh to quantify welfare losses from a tropical cyclone under present and future climatic and socio-economic conditions. We further test various adaptation options that are intended to enhance resilience. Results show that poor households experience, on average, 7\% of the asset losses, but 42\% of the welfare losses. Combining dike heightening, post-disaster support and stronger housing can reduce welfare losses by up to 70\%, and foster sustainable development by benefitting the poor, increasing resilience and demonstrating robustness under socio-economic and climatic uncertainties. Thus, a welfare orientated perspective helps to identify adaptation options that enhance resilience and leave no-one behind.	resilience; disaster risk reduction; bangladesh; sustainable development	2020	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In response to urbanization in at risk areas, the concept of territorial resilience has potential as an approach to urban flood issues. The objective of this research is to develop a spatial decision support tool based on a collaborative assessment method of territorial resilience. The proposed methodology consists of: the adaptation to the French Polynesian context, three existing resilience assessment methods applied to a case study in the Punaruu Valley's (Punaauia, French Polynesia) and the use of geovisualization techniques: use of GIS for data processing and analysis, visualization, mapping and model processing. This methodology integrates the technical, urban and social components of the territory, while highlighting the various levers available to improve territorial resilience and facilitate its understanding through collaborative work efforts and the use of a visual tool. The results demonstrate the reproducibility of these methods for assessing resilience in French Polynesia. They underline the potential of a collaborative approach to highlight critical infrastructures and generate possible decision support to improve the territory's ability to function despite a disruption and the ability to rebuild following this disruption.	pacific island; flood risk management; decisional support system (dss); resilience operationalization	2021	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
91760903	13440	2019.1412	Towards adaptive coastal management: Lessons from a ``legal storm{''} in Byron Shire, Australia	Adaptive management has been advocated as an appropriate approach for the management of social-ecological systems, although its implementation has proven to be a challenge. Legal systems can hinder or facilitate adaptive management. Focusing on legal arrangements, this article explores how adaptive management can be better operationalised in the context of coastal management. Byron Shire, a local government area in New South Wales, Australia, was selected as a case study where we: (a) analysed how the concept of adaptive management has emerged within the evolution of coastal management and its applicable legal framework, and (b) identified juridical constraints to adaptive coastal management. Qualitative methods were used for the analysis of relevant documents and semi-structured interviews with 23 key informants. The results show that a distorted version of adaptive management has been adopted in Byron Shire's draft coastal management plans, which fails to adhere to the formal, structured, and iterative process of adaptive management. A legacy created by the legal effects of past decisions affecting coastal management has led to a path dependency towards protective measures to manage coastal erosion, constraining other management options, particularly managed realignment strategies. Failure to address juridical constraints in the early stages of the adaptive management process can result in stakeholder conflict and litigation. Overlitigation harms adaptive coastal management by pushing the decision-making process away from the pathway offered by the legal framework for preparing and implementing coastal management plans. After recent legislative coastal reform at the state level, there is momentum for the Byron Shire Council to refocus its adaptive management approach. However, overcoming existing juridical constraints will require adaptive governance, in which all levels of government must work collaboratively with the affected stakeholders in the design and implementation of the adaptive management process.	adaptive governance; adaptive management; law; managed realignment; path dependency	2019	AC	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
NA	277352	2010.2007	Can ocean iron fertilization mitigate ocean acidification?	Ocean iron fertilization has been proposed as a method to mitigate anthropogenic climate change, and there is continued commercial interest in using iron fertilization to generate carbon credits. It has been further speculated that ocean iron fertilization could help mitigate ocean acidification. Here, using a global ocean carbon cycle model, we performed idealized ocean iron fertilization simulations to place an upper bound on the effect of iron fertilization on atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidification. Under the IPCC A2 CO2 emission scenario, at year 2100 the model simulates an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 965 ppm with the mean surface ocean pH 0. 44 units less than its pre-industrial value of 8. 18. A globally sustained ocean iron fertilization could not diminish CO2 concentrations below 833 ppm or reduce the mean surface ocean pH change to less than 0. 38 units. This maximum of 0. 06 unit mitigation in surface pH change by the end of this century is achieved at the cost of storing more anthropogenic CO2 in the ocean interior, furthering acidifying the deep-ocean. If the amount of net carbon storage in the deep ocean by iron fertilization produces an equivalent amount of emission credits, ocean iron fertilization further acidifies the deep ocean without conferring any chemical benefit to the surface ocean.

NA	275416	2011.9115	Using flue gas to mitigate ocean acidification	Researchers from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL) Carbon Management Program and the University of California, Santa Cruz found that seawater and calcium could effectively remove most of the CO2 from a natural gas power plant's flue gas stream. A large fraction of the captured gas could then be converted into dissolved calcium bicarbonate - which, pumped into the sea, could be beneficial to the ocean's marine life. The results mean that above-ground CO2 hydration and mineral carbonate scrubbing may provide a "relatively simple" point-source CO2 capture and storage system at coastal locations. According to Greg Rau, a senior scientist with the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz who also works at LLNL, such low-tech CO2 mitigation could be especially relevant for retrofitting to existing power plants and for deployment in the developing world, the primary source of future CO2 emissions.

NA	275824	2011.9303	Ecological engineering of artificial oyster reefs to enhance carbon sequestration via the algae-oyster complex	Ecological engineering of bioengineered reef systems has been shown useful in reducing or reversing erosion in shallow estuarine systems, reducing wave energy, producing food, enhancing habitat, and, coupled with natural solar energy gatherers such as algae, sequestering carbon in a sustainable fashion. Use of biological organism complexes such as algae and oysters to sequester carbon can provide a sustainable solar based solution for carbon capture and storage (CCS) to mitigate the risks of climate change. On a carbon per time per surface area basis, these reefs can be orders of magnitude more effective than grass based systems and significantly more effective than some tree based systems. Concerns over ocean acidification also suggest removal of carbon from the ocean. However, oysters alone are animals which are net producers of carbon dioxide, whereas oysters coupled with algae can be net long term carbon sequesterers, therefore the net carbon sequestration potential of the Eastern Oyster Crassostrea virginica with algae species. A system was designed to assess growth of both algae and oysters in a completely closed system. Relevant parameters include CO2 and O2 in air and water; shell carbon sequestration, wet and dry biomass, net algae concentrations, and pH. Results include quantification of carbon sequestered in various normalized formats and suggest the algae-oyster complex provides significant long term sustainable carbon sequestration potential. Recent moderate sized projects (meters to kilometers; kiloton size basis) are being monitored to assess results on a larger scale and larger projects (multikilometer, megaton mass basis) are proposed. A brief review of these projects shows the potential for scaleability of such ecological engineering techniques.	acidification;  algae;  carbon dioxide;  climate change;  ecosystems;  engineering;  engineers;  environmental management;  reefs;  shellfish;  solar energy;  wave energy conversion, a-carbon;  biological organisms;  carbon capture and storage;  carbon sequestration;  carbon sequestration potential;  closed systems;  crassostrea virginica;  eastern oyster;  ecological engineering;  ecosystem services;  estuarine systems;  orders of magnitude;  oysters;  sequestering carbon;  surface area;  tree-based;  wave energy;  wet and dry, carbon	2011	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	237294	2013.10152	Taking Action Against Ocean Acidification: A Review of Management and Policy Options	Ocean acidification has emerged over the last two decades as one of the largest threats to marine organisms and ecosystems. However, most research efforts on ocean acidification have so far neglected management and related policy issues to focus instead on understanding its ecological and biogeochemical implications. This shortfall is addressed here with a systematic, international and critical review of management and policy options. In particular, we investigate the assumption that fighting acidification is mainly, but not only, about reducing CO2 emissions, and explore the leeway that this emerging problem may open in old environmental issues. We review nine types of management responses, initially grouped under four categories: preventing ocean acidification; strengthening ecosystem resilience; adapting human activities; and repairing damages. Connecting and comparing options leads to classifying them, in a qualitative way, according to their potential and feasibility. While reducing CO2 emissions is confirmed as the key action that must be taken against acidification, some of the other options appear to have the potential to buy time, e.g. by relieving the pressure of other stressors, and help marine life face unavoidable acidification. Although the existing legal basis to take action shows few gaps, policy challenges are significant: tackling them will mean succeeding in various areas of environmental management where we failed to a large extent so far.	ocean acidification; marine ecosystems; management; policy; resilience; adaptation	2013	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
NA	270095	2013.1481	Coralline algal structure is more sensitive to rate, rather than the magnitude, of ocean acidification	Marine pCO2 enrichment via ocean acidification (OA), upwelling and release from carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities is projected to have devastating impacts on marine biomineralisers and the services they provide. However, empirical studies using stable endpoint pCO2 concentrations find species exhibit variable biological and geochemical responses rather than the expected negative patterns. In addition, the carbonate chemistry of many marine systems is now being observed to be more variable than previously thought. To underpin more robust projections of future OA impacts on marine biomineralisers and their role in ecosystem service provision, we investigate coralline algal responses to realistically variable scenarios of marine pCO2 enrichment. Coralline algae are important in ecosystem function; providing habitats and nursery areas, hosting high biodiversity, stabilizing reef structures and contributing to the carbon cycle. Red coralline marine algae were exposed for 80Â days to one of three pH treatments: (i) current pH (control); (ii) low pH (7.7) representing OA change; and (iii) an abrupt drop to low pH (7.7) representing the higher rates of pH change observed at natural vent systems, in areas of upwelling and during CCS releases. We demonstrate that red coralline algae respond differently to the rate and the magnitude of pH change induced by pCO2 enrichment. At low pH, coralline algae survived by increasing their calcification rates. However, when the change to low pH occurred at a fast rate we detected, using Raman spectroscopy, weaknesses in the calcite skeleton, with evidence of dissolution and molecular positional disorder. This suggests that, while coralline algae will continue to calcify, they may be structurally weakened, putting at risk the ecosystem services they provide. Notwithstanding evolutionary adaptation, the ability of coralline algae to cope with OA may thus be determined primarily by the rate, rather than magnitude, at which pCO2 enrichment occurs.

NA	161648	2014.4519	Future-proofing marine protected area networks for cold water coral reefs	Ideally, networks of marine protected areas should be designed with consideration for future changes. We examine how this could be tackled using the example of cold-water coral reefs which provide a number of ecosystem services but are vulnerable to both managed pressures (e.g. deep-water trawling) and unmanaged pressures (e.g. ocean acidification). We collated data on the known and predicted distribution of Northeast Atlantic coral reefs, their protected areas, and fishing effort. We modelled the effects of ocean acidification on aragonite saturation to examine whether existing protected areas will ensure adequate protection for cold-water coral reefs under four possible future scenarios across two models. The best-case scenario suggests only minor impacts of ocean acidification, and that trawling remains the main threat to these reefs. However, in the worst-case scenario, by 2060, over 85\% of these reefs are expected to be exposed to corrosive waters. We argue that unmanaged pressures such as ocean acidification and global warming should be incorporated into marine management decisions, with a focus on the protection of cold-water coral reefs to ensure long-term survival of these habitats. A similar approach could be taken for other iconic marine habitats in the face of climate change.	cold-water coral reef; marine protected areas; ocean acidification	2014	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

Climate change and ocean acidification are likely to have severe implications for many deep-sea ecosystems and communities, but what, if anything, can be done to mitigate these threats is poorly understood. To begin to bridge this gap, we convened a stakeholder workshop to assess and prioritize options for conserving legislatively protected deep-sea coral reefs off southeast Australia that, without management intervention, are likely to be severely degraded within decades as a result of climate change. Seventeen possible options were explored that span biological, engineering and regulatory domains and that differed widely in their perceived costs, benefits, time to implementation, and risks. In the short term, the highest priority identified is the need to urgently locate and protect sites globally that are, or will become, refugia areas for the coral and its associated community as climate change progresses.

Storage of CO2 under the seabed moves this climate mitigation option away from inhabited areas and could thereby take away some of the opposition towards this technology. Given that in the event of CO2 leakage through the overburden in the case of sub-seabed CCS, the ocean could function as buffer for receiving this greenhouse gas, instead of it directly being emitted into the atmosphere, offshore CCS could also address concerns over the climatic impacts of CO2 seepage. We point out that recent geological studies provide evidence that to date CO2 has been safely stored under the seabed. Leakage for individual offshore CCS operations could thus be unlikely from a technical point of view, if storage sites are well chosen, well managed and well monitored. But we argue that on a global longterm scale, for an ensemble of thousands or millions of storage sites, leakage of CO2 could take place in certain cases and/or countries for e.g. economic, institutional, legal or safety-cultural reasons. In this paper we investigate what the impact could be in terms of temperature increase and ocean acidification if leakage occurs at a global level, and address the question what the relative roles could be of on- and offshore CCS if mankind desires to divert the damages resulting from climate change. For this purpose, we constructed a top-down energy-environment-economy model, with which we performed a probabilistic Monte-Carlo cost-benefit analysis of climate change mitigation with on- and offshore CCS as specific CO2 abatement options. One of our main conclusions is that, even under conditions with non-zero (permille/year) leakage for CCS activity globally, both onshore and offshore CCS should probably â€“ on economic grounds at least - still account for anywhere between 20Â % and 80Â % of all future CO2 abatement efforts under a broad range of CCS cost assumptions.

NA	16624	2016.1221	Enhanced weathering strategies for stabilizing climate and averting ocean acidification	Chemical breakdown of rocks, weathering, is an important but very slow part of the carbon cycle that ultimately leads to CO2 being locked up in carbonates on the ocean floor. Artificial acceleration of this carbon sink via distribution of pulverized silicate rocks across terrestrial landscapesmay help offset anthropogenic CO2 emissions(1-5). We show that idealized enhanced weathering scenarios over less than a third of tropical land could cause significant drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and ameliorate ocean acidification by 2100. Global carbon cycle modelling(6-8) driven by ensemble Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) projections of twenty-first-century climate change (RCP8.5, business-as-usual; RCP4.5, medium-level mitigation)(9,10) indicates that enhanced weathering could lower atmospheric CO2 by 30-300 ppm by 2100, depending mainly on silicate rock application rate (1 kg or 5 kg m(-2) yr(-1)) and composition. At the higher application rate, end-of-century ocean acidification is reversed under RCP4.5 and reduced by about two-thirds under RCP8.5. Additionally, surface ocean aragonite saturation state, a key control on coral calcification rates, is maintained above 3.5 throughout the low latitudes, thereby helping maintain the viability of tropical coral reef ecosystems(11-14). However, we highlight major issues of cost, social acceptability, and potential unanticipated consequences that will limit utilization and emphasize the need for urgent efforts to phase down fossil fuel emissions(15).

NA	58257	2016.3606	Optimising reef-scale CO2 removal by seaweed to buffer ocean acidification	The equilibration of rising atmospheric CO2 with the ocean is lowering pH in tropical waters by about 0.01 every decade. Coral reefs and the ecosystems they support are regarded as one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to ocean acidification, threatening their long-term viability. In response to this threat, different strategies for buffering the impact of ocean acidification have been proposed. As the pH experienced by individual corals on a natural reef system depends on many processes over different time scales, the efficacy of these buffering strategies remains largely unknown. Here we assess the feasibility and potential efficacy of a reef-scale (a few kilometers) carbon removal strategy, through the addition of seaweed (fleshy multicellular algae) farms within the Great Barrier Reef at the Heron Island reef. First, using diagnostic time-dependent age tracers in a hydrodynamic model, we determine the optimal location and size of the seaweed farm. Secondly, we analytically calculate the optimal density of the seaweed and harvesting strategy, finding, for the seaweed growth parameters used, a biomass of 42 g N m(-2) with a harvesting rate of up 3.2 g N m(-2) d(-1) maximises the carbon sequestration and removal. Numerical experiments show that an optimally located 1.9 km(2) farm and optimally harvested seaweed (removing biomass above 42 g N m(-2) every 7 d) increased aragonite saturation by 0.1 over 24 km(2) of the Heron Island reef. Thus, the most effective seaweed farm can only delay the impacts of global ocean acidification at the reef scale by 7-21 years, depending on future global carbon emissions. Our results highlight that only a kilometer-scale farm can partially mitigate global ocean acidification for a particular reef.	ocean acidfication; carbonate chemistry; marine management; coral reef	2016	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	263113	2016.864	Simulating CO2 leakages from CCS to determine Zn toxicity using the marine microalgae Pleurochrysis roscoffensis	Due to the current climate change and ocean acidification, a new technology for CO2 mitigation has been proposed, the Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS). However, there is an ecological risk associated with potential CO2 leakages from the sub-seabed storages sites. To evaluate the effects related to CO2 leakages, laboratory-scales experiments were performed using the marine microalgae Pleurochrysis roscoffensis. Five Zn concentrations were tested at different pHs to study Zn toxicity under acidified conditions. Seawater was collected and submitted to acidification by means of CO2 injection and by HCl addition. Results showed differences between both acidification techniques: while microalgae growth was enhanced by CO2 supply, reaching the optimal growth at pH 6.5 and full inhibition at pH 5.5, HCl acidification growth was inhibited at pH 6.5. Although small concentrations of Zn were positive for P. roscoffensis growth, Zn toxicity increased at lower pHs, and more severely on samples acidified with HCl. The conclusions obtained in this work are useful to address the potential effects on the marine ecosystem related to changes in metal bioavailability during CO2 leakages scenarios.

NA	12425	2016.946	Solutions for ecosystem-level protection of ocean systems under climate change	The Paris Conference of Parties (COP21) agreement renewed momentum for action against climate change, creating the space for solutions for conservation of the ocean addressing two of its largest threats: climate change and ocean acidification (CCOA). Recent arguments that ocean policies disregard a mature conservation research field and that protected areas cannot address climate change may be oversimplistic at this time when dynamic solutions for the management of changing oceans are needed. We propose a novel approach, based on spatial meta-analysis of climate impact models, to improve the positioning of marine protected areas to limit CCOA impacts. We do this by estimating the vulnerability of ocean ecosystems to CCOA in a spatially explicit manner and then co-mapping human activities such as the placement of renewable energy developments and the distribution of marine protected areas. We test this approach in the NE Atlantic considering also how CCOA impacts the base of the food web which supports protected species, an aspect often neglected in conservation studies. We found that, in this case, current regional conservation plans protect areas with low ecosystem-level vulnerability to CCOA, but disregard how species may redistribute to new, suitable and productive habitats. Under current plans, these areas remain open to commercial extraction and other uses. Here, and worldwide, ocean conservation strategies under CCOA must recognize the long-term importance of these habitat refuges, and studies such as this one are needed to identify them. Protecting these areas creates adaptive, climate-ready and ecosystem-level policy options for conservation, suitable for changing oceans.	climate change; conservation; cop21; ecosystem model; habitat; marine spatial planning; ocean; ocean acidification; species distribution; warming	2016	Devi	NA	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
NA	258531	2017.1978	Physiological responses of coccolithophores to abrupt exposure of naturally low pH deep seawater	Upwelling is the process by which deep, cold, relatively high-CO2, nutrient-rich seawater rises to the sunlit surface of the ocean. This seasonal process has fueled geoengineering initiatives to fertilize the surface ocean with deep seawater to enhance productivity and thus promote the drawdown of CO2. Coccolithophores, which inhabit many upwelling regions naturally â€˜fertilizedâ€™ by deep seawater, have been investigated in the laboratory in the context of ocean acidification to determine the extent to which nutrients and CO2 impact their physiology, but few data exist in the field except from mesocosms. Here, we used the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (north Atlantic Ocean) Observatory to retrieve seawater from depths with elevated CO2 and nutrients, mimicking geoengineering approaches. We tested the effects of abrupt natural deep seawater fertilization on the physiology and biogeochemistry of two strains of Emiliania huxleyi of known physiology. None of the strains tested underwent cell divisions when incubated in waters obtained from &lt;1,000 m (pH = 7.99â€“8.08; CO2 = 373â€“485 p.p.m; 1.5â€“12 Î¼M nitrate). However, growth was promoted in both strains when cells were incubated in seawater from ~1,000 m (pH = 7.9; CO2 ~560 p.p.m.; 14â€“17 Î¼M nitrate) and ~4,800 m (pH = 7.9; CO2 ~600 p.p.m.; 21 Î¼M nitrate). Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP 88E showed no differences in growth rate or in cellular content or production rates of particulate organic (POC) and inorganic (PIC) carbon and cellular particulate organic nitrogen (PON) between treatments using water from 1,000 m and 4,800 m. However, despite the N: P ratio of seawater being comparable in water from ~1,000 and ~4,800 m, the PON production rates were three times lower in one incubation using water from ~1,000 m compared to values observed in water from ~4,800 m. Thus, the POC:PON ratios were threefold higher in cells that were incubated in ~1,000 m seawater. The heavily calcified strain NZEH exhibited lower growth rates and PIC production rates when incubated in water from ~4,800 m compared to ~1,000 m, while cellular PIC, POC and PON were higher in water from 4,800 m. Calcite Sr/Ca ratios increased with depth despite constant seawater Sr/Ca, indicating that upwelling changes coccolith geochemistry. Our study provides the first experimental and field trial of a geoengineering approach to test how deep seawater impacts coccolithophore physiological and biogeochemical properties. Given that coccolithophore growth was only stimulated using waters obtained from &gt;1,000 m, artificial upwelling using shallower waters may not be a suitable approach for promoting carbon sequestration for some locations and assemblages, and should therefore be investigated on a site-by-site basis.

NA	249840	2017.6085	Ecological performance of construction materials subject to ocean climate change	Artificial structures will be increasingly utilized to protect coastal infrastructure from sea-level rise and storms associated with climate change. Although it is well documented that the materials comprising artificial structures influence the composition of organisms that use them as habitat, little is known about how these materials may chemically react with changing seawater conditions, and what effects this will have on associated biota. We investigated the effects of ocean warming, acidification, and type of coastal infrastructure material on algal turfs. Seawater acidification resulted in greater covers of turf, though this effect was counteracted by elevated temperatures. Concrete supported a greater cover of turf than granite or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) under all temperature and pH treatments, with the greatest covers occurring under simulated ocean acidification. Furthermore, photosynthetic efficiency under acidification was greater on concrete substratum compared to all other materials and treatment combinations. These results demonstrate the capacity to maximise ecological benefits whilst still meeting local management objectives when engineering coastal defense structures by selecting materials that are appropriate in an ocean change context. Therefore, mitigation efforts to offset impacts from sea-level rise and storms can also be engineered to alter, or even reduce, the effects of climatic change on biological assemblages.

NA	9008	2017.742	Can Seaweed Farming Play a Role in Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation?	Seaweed aquaculture, the fastest-growing component of global food production, offers a slate of opportunities to mitigate, and adapt to climate change. Seaweed farms release carbon that maybe buried in sediments or exported to the deep sea, therefore acting as a CO2 sink. The crop can also be used, in total or in part, for biofuel production, with a potential CO2 mitigation capacity, in terms of avoided emissions from fossil fuels, of about 1,500 tons CO2 km(-2) year(-1). Seaweed aquaculture can also help reduce the emissions from agriculture, by improving soil quality substituting synthetic fertilizer and when included in cattle fed, lowering methane emissions from cattle. Seaweed aquaculture contributes to climate change adaptation by damping wave energy and protecting shorelines, and by elevating pH and supplying oxygen to the waters, thereby locally reducing the effects of ocean acidification and de-oxygenation. The scope to expand seaweed aquaculture is, however, limited by the availability of suitable areas and competition for suitable areas with other uses, engineering systems capable of coping with rough conditions offshore, and increasing market demand for seaweed products, among other factors. Despite these limitations, seaweed farming practices can be optimized to maximize climate benefits, which may, if economically compensated, improve the income of seaweed farmers.	seaweed; aquaculture; carbon dioxide; macroalgae; sequestration; climate change	2017	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	51792	2018.3903	Short-Term Spatial and Temporal Carbonate Chemistry Variability in Two Contrasting Seagrass Meadows: Implications for pH Buffering Capacities	It has been hypothesized that highly productive coastal ecosystems, such as seagrass meadows, could lead to the establishment of ocean acidification (OA) refugia, or areas of elevated pH and aragonite saturation state (Omega(a)) compared to source seawater. However, seagrass ecosystems experience extreme variability in carbonate chemistry across short temporal and small spatial scales, which could impact the pH buffering capacity of these potential refugia. Herein, short-term (hourly to diel) and small-scale (across 0.01-0.14 km(2)) spatiotemporal carbonate chemistry variability was assessed within two seagrass meadows in order to determine their short-term potential to elevate seawater pH relative to source seawater. Two locations at similar latitudes were chosen in order to compare systems dominated by coarse calcium carbonate (Bailey's Bay, Bermuda) and muddy silicate (Mission Bay, CA, USA) sediments. In both systems, spatial variability of pH across the seagrass meadow at any given time was often greater than diel variability (e.g., the average range over 24 h) at any one site, with greater spatial variability occurring at low tide in Mission Bay. Mission Bay (spatial Delta pH = 0.08 +/- 0.08; diel Delta pH = 0.12 +/- 0.01; mean +/- SD) had a greater average range in both temporal and spatial seawater chemistry than Bailey's Bay (spatial Delta pH = 0.02 +/- 0.01; diel Delta pH = 0.03 +/- 0.00; mean +/- SD). These differences were most likely due to a combination of slower currents, a larger tidal range, and more favorable weather conditions for photosynthesis (e.g., sunny with no rain) in Mission Bay. In both systems, there was a substantial amount of time (usually at night) when seawater pH within the seagrass beds was lower relative to the source seawater. Future studies aimed at assessing the potential of seagrass ecosystems to act as OA refugia for marine organisms need to account for the small-scale, high-frequency carbonate chemistry variability in both space and time, as this variability will impact where and when OA will be buffered or intensified.	ocean acidification; coastal ecosystems; buffering; seagrass; carbonate chemistry; seaphox	2018	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	7878	2019.849	A review of interventions proposed to abate impacts of ocean acidification on coral reefs	Coral reefs experiencing ocean acidification (OA) are likely to recover much more slowly from damage caused by acute events such as mass bleaching because OA slows coral reef growth and reproduction. To maintain reefs in a net growth or net-neutral condition, curbing the impact of OA is therefore necessary. A variety of mitigation and adaptation strategies have been proposed to abate OA impacts on reefs. However, detailed guidance for managers on the types, effectiveness, or costs of different local interventions to address OA is scarce. To advance the discussion about available interventions, this review explores and compares mitigation and adaptation techniques that have been proposed to abate OA impacts on coral reefs. We focus primarily on four categories of interventions intended to address different ecosystem service changes: phytoremediation, chemical remediation, reef restoration, and assisted evolution. We briefly touch on traditional restoration methods like marine protected areas (MPAs) and reducing secondary sources of stress. Of the techniques reviewed, most are costly and do not scale at the same pace as global reef loss. Nor do they address the root cause of OA, global carbon emissions. That said, intervention should not be an all or nothing approach; some techniques may be worth implementing at smaller scales in a coordinated way. Working to save pieces of ecosystems and buying time may help ensure that there is more to rebuild from in the future. Despite the seemingly high price tag of many of these techniques, given the potential value of regained ecosystem services, net gains may exceed implementation costs. It is certain, however, from the limited reach of coral reef interventions, that they must be undertaken as part of a suite of global-scale interventions including atmospheric CO2 reduction to preserve coral reef ecosystem function and benefits to humanity.

NA	248114	2019.8941	Building global change resilience: Concrete has the potential to ameliorate the negative effects of climate-driven ocean change on a newly-settled calcifying invertebrate	Global climate change is driving sea level rise and increasingly frequent storm events, which are negatively impacting rapidly-growing coastal communities. To mitigate these impacts, coastal infrastructure must be further protected by upgrading hard defences. We propose that incorporating pH-buffering materials into these upgrades could safeguard marine organisms from the adverse effects of ocean acidification and ocean warming during the vulnerable transition from planktonic larvae to benthic juveniles. To test this, we examined the effects of ocean warming (24 or 27 degrees C), ocean acidification (pH 8.1, 7.9, 7.7), and substratum(concrete, greywacke, granite) in all combinations on the settlement success of an ecologically and commercially important sea urchin, Tripneustes gratilla. Low pH (7.9, 7.7) generally reduced the quantity and size of juveniles four weeks post-settlement, although this was partially ameliorated by increased temperature (24 vs. 27 degrees C). In the warmed and acidified treatments, settlement rates were lower on concrete than granite or greywacke, but two weeks post-settlement, juveniles on concrete were larger, and had longer spines and higher survival rates than on greywacke or granite, respectively. The benefits provided by concrete to newly-settled juveniles may be related to alkali chemicals leaching from concrete buffering low pH conditions in surrounding seawater and/or increased availability of bicarbonate in the boundary layers around its surface. Our results highlight the potential for pH-buffering materials to assist marine organisms in coping with the effects of changing ocean conditions, but further research is required to understand the generality and mechanism(s) driving the beneficial effects of concrete and to test pH-buffering materials in the field.

In this context, ocean acidification (OA) has the potential to affect important socioeconomic activities, including shellfish aquaculture, due to changes in the seawater carbonate system. However, coastal environments are characterised by strong diurnal pH fluctuations associated with the metabolic activity of macroalgae; that is, photosynthesis and respiration. This suggests that calcifying organisms that inhabit these ecosystems are adapted to this fluctuating pH environment. Macrophyte-dominated environments may have the potential to act as an OA buffering system in the form of a photosynthetic footprint, by reducing excess of CO2 and increasing the seawater pH and ohm(arg). This can support calcification and other threatened physiological processes of calcifying organisms under a reduced pH environment. Because this footprint is supportive beyond the macroalgal canopy spatial area, this chemical refuge mechanism can be applied to support shellfish aquaculture, e.g. mussels. However, this approach should be tested in commercial shellfish farms to determine critical aspects of implementation. This includes critical factors such as target species and productivity rates. The degree of OA buffering capacity caused by the metabolic activity of macroalgae might depend on community structure and hydrodynamic conditions, creating site-specific responses. This concept might aid the development of future adaptive strategies, supporting marine ecological planning for the mussel aquaculture industry in Chile.	calcification; carbonate chemistry; multitrophic aquaculture; ocean acidification; ph	2019	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
NA	244565	2020.18165	THE EFFECT OF ACIDIFICATION ON GROWTH AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS RATE OF SEAGRASS Thalassia hemprichii ( Ehrenberg.) Ascherson	Seagrass is a water plant that has flowers and ability to adapt to live and grow in the sea like a terrestrial plant. The survival of seagrass is greatly influenced by physical and chemical parameters of waters, such as pH, temperature, and salinity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report by the end of 21st century, CO2 in the atmosphere has doubled along with the industrial development. The increase in CO2 in the atmosphere causes ocean acidification, it can change the chemical structure and decrease the pH of sea water. The low pH of sea water influences plant phisiology such as the inhibition of photosynthesis and growth. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of pH on the growth and photosynthesis rate of seagrass Thalassia hemprichii. The study used Completely Randomized Design with 3 treatments control (8.10-8.50), medium pH (7.768.00) and low pH (7.50-7.75) in 5 replicates. The results showed that growth rate, photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content has a bigger value on control treatment than the low pH treatment. The ANOVA test results were not significant for all treatment variables and had a negative impact on the survival of seagrass.	acidification; chlorophyll; photosynthesis rate; thalassia hemprichii	2020	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	185	2020.22	Adaptation to climate change-related ocean acidification: An adaptive governance approach	Climate change-driven ocean acidification (OA) is causing rapid change to global ecosystems and poses a significant threat to marine life. However, predicting ecosystem effects remains highly uncertain and governance responses to OA are not yet forthcoming. Adaptive governance can provide a means to deal with this uncertainty and we consider its application to the polycentric governance of adaptation responses to OA in Scotland, focussing on the aquaculture industry as a vulnerable sector. A workshop was used to develop potential responses to OA and to gain information about present and potential capacity for adaptive governance at national and regional levels. Scottish legislation, policy and planning documents were subsequently analysed to enable description of how governance and management arrangements constrain or enable adaptation responses. Legislative and policy analysis indicates convergence across emerging mechanisms in support of adaptive governance and identified interventions. Recent advances in climate change adaptation in Scotland promotes integration of adaptation into wider Scottish Government policy development and functions, based on iterative and collaborative processes across scales. Alongside this, new models of coastal and marine governance, including a partnership-led regional marine planning process and devolution of seabed management rights under Crown Estate Scotland, seek to advance new models of locally-led and learning-based planning and management which can support adaptation responses. However, adaptation measures at operational scale requires flexibility in the aquaculture licensing regime which is currently of low adaptive capacity. Further, expansion of the industry faces social and ecological constraints which limit spatial measures, and are complicated by uncertainty in predicting local OA effects. Expanding the use of holistic and co-operative management tools such as Aquaculture Management Areas could support adaptation across wider spatial scales. Better integration across policy and planning instruments is also needed to enhance adaptive capacity, including between climate change adaptation, marine planning and aquaculture planning and management. This could be enabled by establishing links between existing and proposed collaborative groups to enhance development of adaptation responses and through co-ordination of monitoring and review processes to promote learning across scales.	ocean acidification; adaptive governance; climate change adaptation; aquaculture	2020	Devi	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
NA	56559	2020.5180	Ocean acidification alters meiobenthic assemblage composition and organic matter degradation rates in seagrass sediments	Seagrass meadows are an important organic matter (OM) reservoir but, are currently being lost due to global and regional stressors. Yet, there is limited research investigating the cumulative impacts of anthropogenic stressors on the structure and functioning of seagrass benthic assemblages, key drivers of OM mineralization and burial. Here, using a 16-month field experiment, we assessed how meiobenthic assemblages and extracellular enzymatic activities (as a proxy of OM degradation) in Posidonia oceanica sediments responded to ocean acidification (OA) and nutrient loadings, at CO2 vents. P. oceanica meadows were exposed to three nutrient levels (control, moderate, and high) at both ambient and low pH sites. OA altered meiobenthic assemblage structure, resulting in increased abundance of annelids and crustaceans, along with a decline in foraminifera. In addition, low pH enhanced OM degradation rates in seagrass sediments by enhancing extracellular enzymatic activities, potentially decreasing the sediment carbon storage capacity of seagrasses. Nutrient enrichment had no effect on the response variables analyzed, suggesting that, under nutrient concentration unlikely to cause N or P imitation, a moderate increase of dissolved nutrients in the water column had limited influence on meiobenthic assemblages. These findings show that OA can significantly alter meiobenthic assemblage structure and enhance OM degradation rates in seagrass sediments. As meiofauna are ubiquitous key actors in the functioning of benthic ecosystems, we postulated that OA, altering the structure of meiobenthic assemblages and OM degradation, could affect organic carbon sequestration over large spatial scales.

NA	15994	2021.2073	A Unique Diel Pattern in Carbonate Chemistry in the Seagrass Meadows of Dongsha Island: The Enhancement of Metabolic Carbonate Dissolution in a Semienclosed Lagoon	In contrast to other seagrass meadows where seawater carbonate chemistry generally shows strong diel variations with higher pH but lower partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) during the daytime and lower pH but higher pCO(2) during nighttime due to the alternation in photosynthesis and respiration, the seagrass meadows of the inner lagoon (IL) on Dongsha Island had a unique diel pattern with extremely high pH and low pCO(2) across a diel cycle. We suggest that this distinct diel pattern in pH and pCO(2) could be associated with the enhancement of total alkalinity (TA) production coupled to carbonate sediment dissolution in a semienclosed lagoon. The confinement of the IL may hamper water exchange and seagrass detritus export to the adjacent open ocean, which may result in higher organic matter loading to the sediments, and longer residence time of the water in the IL, accompanied by microbial respiration (both aerobic and anaerobic) that may reduce carbonate saturation level to drive carbonate dissolution and thus TA elevation, thereby forming such a unique diel pattern in carbonate chemistry. This finding further highlights the importance of considering TA production through metabolic carbonate dissolution when evaluating the potential of coastal blue carbon ecosystems to buffer ocean acidification and to absorb atmospheric CO2, in particular in a semienclosed setting.	alkalinity production; carbonate dissolution; seagrass; dongsha island; blue carbon; ocean acidification	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	296720	2021.437	The role of enhanced rock weathering deployment with agriculture in limiting future warming and protecting coral reefs	Meeting the net-zero carbon emissions commitments of major economies by mid-century requires large-scale deployment of negative emission technologies (NETs). Terrestrial enhanced rock weathering on croplands (ERW) is a NET with co-benefits for agriculture, soils and ocean acidification that creates opportunities for generating income unaffected by diminishing carbon taxes as emissions approach net-zero. Here we show that ERW deployment with croplands to deliver net 2 Gt CO2 yr-1 removal approximately doubles the probability of meeting the Paris 1.5 Â°C target at 2100 from 23% to 42% in a high mitigation Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 baseline climate. Carbon removal via carbon capture and storage (CCS) at the same rate had an equivalent effect. Co-deployment of ERW and CCS tripled the chances of meeting a 1.5 Â°C target (from 23% to 67%), and may be sufficient to reverse about one third of the surface ocean acidification effect caused by increases in atmospheric CO2 over the past 200 years. ERW increased the percentage of coral reefs above an aragonite saturation threshold of 3.5 from 16% to 39% at 2100, higher than CCS, highlighting a co-benefit for marine calcifying ecosystems. However, the degree of ocean state recovery in our simulations is highly uncertain and ERW deployment cannot substitute for near-term rapid CO2 emissions reductions. Â© 2021 The Author(s).

NA	60306	2021.5894	Reversing ocean acidification along the Great Barrier Reef using alkalinity injection	The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is a globally significant coral reef system supporting productive and diverse ecosystems. The GBR is under increasing threat from climate change and local anthropogenic stressors, with its general condition degrading over recent decades. In response to this, a number of techniques have been proposed to offset or ameliorate environmental changes. In this study, we use a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model of the GBR and surrounding ocean to simulate artificial ocean alkalinisation (AOA) as a means to reverse the impact of global ocean acidification on GBR reefs. Our results demonstrate that a continuous release of 90 000 t of alkalinity every 3 d over one year along the entire length of the GBR, following the Gladstone-Weipa bulk carrier route, increases the mean aragonite saturation state (Omega(ar)) across the GBR's 3860 reefs by 0.05. This change offsets just over 4 years (similar to 4.2) of ocean acidification under the present rate of anthropogenic carbon emissions. The injection raises Omega(ar) in the 250 reefs closest to the route by >= 0.15, reversing further projected Ocean Acidification. Following cessation of alkalinity injection Q(ar) returns to the value of the waters in the absence of AOA over a 6 month period, primarily due to transport of additional alkalinity into the Coral Sea. Significantly, our study provides for the first time a model of AOA applied along existing shipping infrastructure that has been used to investigate shelf scale impacts. Thus, amelioration of decades of OA on the GBR is feasible using existing infrastructure, but is likely to be extremely expensive, include as yet unquantified risks, and would need to be undertaken continuously until such time, probably centuries in the future, when atmospheric CO2 concentrations have returned to today's values.	carbon chemistry; coral reefs; geoengineering; environmental engineering; ocean acidification	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0
NA	95619	2021.7122	Coast-wide evidence of low pH amelioration by seagrass ecosystems	Global-scale ocean acidification has spurred interest in the capacity of seagrass ecosystems to increase seawater pH within crucial shoreline habitats through photosynthetic activity. However, the dynamic variability of the coastal carbonate system has impeded generalization into whether seagrass aerobic metabolism ameliorates low pH on physiologically and ecologically relevant timescales. Here we present results of the most extensive study to date of pH modulation by seagrasses, spanning seven meadows (Zostera marina) and 1000 km of U.S. west coast over 6 years. Amelioration by seagrass ecosystems compared to non-vegetated areas occurred 65\% of the time (mean increase 0.07 +/- 0.008 SE). Events of continuous elevation in pH within seagrass ecosystems, indicating amelioration of low pH, were longer and of greater magnitude than opposing cases of reduced pH or exacerbation. Sustained elevations in pH of >0.1, comparable to a 30\% decrease in [}H+], were not restricted only to daylight hours but instead persisted for up to 21 days. Maximal pH elevations occurred in spring and summer during the seagrass growth season, with a tendency for stronger effects in higher latitude meadows. These results indicate that seagrass meadows can locally alleviate low pH conditions for extended periods of time with important implications for the conservation and management of coastal ecosystems.	buffer; carbon cycling; carbonate chemistry; mitigation; ocean acidification; photosynthesis; submerged aquatic vegetation; zostera marina	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	13881	2022.1929	California shellfish farmers: Perceptions of changing ocean conditions and strategies for adaptive capacity	Coastal communities along the U.S. West Coast experience a myriad of environmental stressors, including exposure to low pH waters exacerbated by ocean acidification (OA). This can result in ecological and social consequences, making necessary the exploration and support for locally relevant strategies to adapt to OA and other environmental changes. The shellfish aquaculture industry along the West Coast is particularly vulnerable to OA, given the negative effects of low pH on shellfish survival and growth. As such, the social-ecological system exemplified by this industry serves as an opportunity to identify and address strategies for local adaptation. Through interviews conducted with West Coast shellfish farm owners and managers ('growers'), we investigate perceptions of OA and environmental change and identify specific strategies for adaptation. We find that growers are concerned about OA, among many other environmental stressors such as marine pathogens and water temperature. However, growers are often unable to attribute changes in shellfish survival or health to these environmental factors due to a lack of data and the resources and network required to acquire and interpret these data. From these interviews, we identify a list of adaptive strategies growers employ or would like to employ to improve their overall adaptive capacity to multiple stressors (environmental, economic, political), which together, allow farms to weather periods of OA-induced stress more effectively. Very few studies to date have identified specific adaptive strategies derived directly from the communities being impacted. This work therefore fills a gap in the literature on adaptive capacity by amplifying the voices of those on the front lines of climate change and identifying explicit pathways for adaptation.	ocean acidification; adaptive capacity; shellfish aquaculture	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
NA	285131	2022.21382	The roles of macroalgae in climate change mitigation: Opportunities and challenges for marine-based carbon donor	Anthropogenic activities will lead to an exponential increase in CO2 emissions in the future. Increased CO2 emissions have an impact on global climate patterns, ocean acidification, and ecosystem function. Marine vegetation has the potential to absorb CO2 through photosynthesis and store carbon in its biomass and sediments. This is known as blue carbon. Research on blue carbon in the world, including Indonesia, is more focused on seagrass and mangroves because including macroalgae carbon in the blue carbon strategy is still controversial. Currently, there are many considerations for including macroalgal carbon in the blue carbon strategy. Macroalgae have a shorter life cycle than seagrass and mangroves. In addition, macroalgae generally grow on hard substrates, resulting in lower levels of carbon storage than seagrass and mangroves. However, macroalgae can serve as carbon donors and contribute to the effort to mitigate climate change. In this review, we present the potential and challenges of macroalgae as carbon donors. Macroalgae will be significant as carbon donors if they have the following three criteria: high production of biomass; effective biomass moved to recipient habitat; and carbon donors that can be buried in recipient habitat. The fate of macroalgae carbon in recipient habitats still needs to be studied. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

NA	285304	2022.21540	Seaweed farming for food and nutritional security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and women empowerment: A review	Seaweed is a promising marine macroalgae of the millennium, providing various ecological, social, and economic benefits. At present, seaweed production reached 35.8 million t from farming, accounting for 97% of global seaweed output, with a world market of US$ 11.8 billion. Seaweeds are an excellent source of nutritious human food because of their low lipid content, high minerals, fibers, polyunsaturated fatty acids, polysaccharides, vitamins, and bioactive compounds. Many seaweed sub-products offer unique properties to develop various functional foods for the food processing industries. In the perspective of climate change mitigation, seaweed farms absorb carbon, serve as a CO2 sink and reduce agricultural emissions by providing raw materials for biofuel production and livestock feed. Seaweed farming system also helps in climate change adaptation by absorbing wave energy, safeguarding shorelines, raising the pH of the surrounding water, and oxygenating the waters to minimize the impacts of ocean acidification and hypoxia on a localized scale. Moreover, it contributes substantially to the sustainable development of the economic condition of coastal women by providing livelihood opportunities and ensuring financial solvency. This review paper highlights the significance of seaweed farming in global food and nutritional security, mitigation and adaptation to global climate change, and women empowerment within a single frame. This review paper also outlined the major issues and challenges of seaweed farming for obtaining maximum benefits in these aspects. The main challenges of making seaweed as a staple diet to millions of people include producing suitable species of seaweeds, making seaweed products accessible, affordable, nutritionally balanced, and attractive to the consumers. Various food products must be developed from seaweeds that may be considered equivalent to the foods consumed by humans today. Lack of effective marine spatial planning to avoid user conflicts is vital for expanding the seaweed farming systems to provide aquatic foods and contribute globally for mitigation and adaptation of climate change impacts. Hence, women's empowerment through seaweed farming is primarily constrained by the lack of technical knowledge and financial resources to establish the coastal farming system. All the information discussed in this paper will help to understand the critical needs for large-scale seaweed farming for climate resilience mariculture, potentials for global food security, and future research on various aspects of seaweed farming and their diverse utilization.

This study uses a bibliometric review of artificial coral reefs to identify five clusters as gate criteria for artificial reef design. These clusters enable the conceptualization and testing of artificial reefs for optimum integration of sociotechnical requirements, biological integrity, and ecological marine health. The five clusters are: (1) applications, solutions, and performance; (2) management, technology, and science; (3) calci-fication, biomineralization, chemistry, and ocean acidification; (4) coral species survival, mortality, and photosynthesis; and (5) artificial reef development, and coral and fish recruitment. The six biomimicry design stages are: define, biologize, discover, abstract, emulate, and evaluate. The 3D printing and hard corals design attracted a large number of planula larvae and different inhabitant corals, and a high species diversity in the surrounding waters. Practical implications include biomimicry-based means for coral reef restoration and rec-reational ecosystem services.	artificial coral reef; artificial habitats; biomimicry; bibliometric study; coastal structures; innovation; new product development; recreational waters; stage -gate; thailand	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	306740	2023.550	Organic matter processing in a [simulated] offshore wind farm ecosystem in current and future climate and aquaculture scenarios	The rapid development of blue economy and human use of offshore space triggered the concept of co-location of marine activities and is causing diverse local pressures on the environment. These pressures add to, and interact with, global challenges such as ocean acidification and warming. This study investigates the combined pressures of climate change and the planned co-location of offshore wind farm (OWF) and aquaculture zones on the carbon flow through epifaunal communities inhabiting wind turbines in the North Sea. A 13C-labelled phytoplankton pulse-chase experiment was performed in mesocosms (4 m3) holding undisturbed hard-substrate (HS) communities, natural sediment with infauna, and mobile invertebrate predators. Carbon assimilation was quantified under current and predicted future-climate conditions (+3 Â°C and âˆ’0.3 pH units), as well as a future-climate co-use scenario with blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) aquaculture. Climate change induced an increase in macrofaunal carbon assimilation as well as an organic enrichment of underlying sediments. Dynamic (non-)trophic links between M. edulis and other HS epifauna resulted in shifts among the species contributing most to the phytoplankton-derived carbon flow across climate scenarios. Increased inter- and intraspecific resource competition in the presence of M. edulis aquaculture prevented a large increase in the total assimilation of phytoplankton by HS fauna. Lower individual carbon assimilation rates by both mussels and other epifauna suggest that if filter capacity by HS epifauna would approach renewal by advection/mixing, M. edulis individuals would likely grow to a smaller-than-desired commercial size. In the same scenario, benthic organic carbon mineralisation was significantly boosted due to increased organic matter deposition by the aquaculture set-up. Combining these results with in situ OWF abundance data confirmed M. edulis as the most impactful OWF AHS species in terms of (total) carbon assimilation as well as the described stress responses due to climate change and the addition of bivalve aquaculture.

NA	294394	1985.2160	ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT OF THE OCEANS BY INCREASED SOLAR RADIATION FROM SPACE.	The author explains how increased solar radiation from space light systems can enhance ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), ocean kelp farming, sea-food production, and rejuvenation of polluted oceans. Space light reflectors focused on OTEC sites can enhance ocean thermal energy conversion by increasing the temperature difference between surface waters and the cold ocean depths. In conjunction with nutrient-rich water from ocean upwelling pipes, space light can stimulate the growth of phytoplankton on which commercially valuable fish feed. Efficient integration of these space and ocean systems can produce energy and restore life to polluted oceans.	marine biology;  ocean thermal energy conversion - radiation effects;  water pollution - water quality, ocean kelp farming enhancement;  phytoplankton growth stimulation;  sea-food production enhancement, solar radiation	1985	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
NA	292469	1992.165	Marine algae as a co2 sink	The most effective ways to reduce CO2 emissions are to improve the energy efficiency of each economic sector and to reduce the cutting of tropical and temperate forests around the world. These options, however, may not fully reach their technical and economic potential due to various political and socioeconomic barriers. Other more innovative and less well developed mitigation measures therefore will be required. The most practical of these is to increase CO2 sinks through photosynthesis in both standing tree biomass and in ocean primary producers. In this paper, the use of marine algae as CO2 sinks is reviewed from a technical, engineering/economic, and environmental perspective. Two open ocean options are considered for large-scale CO2 mitigation: the use of phytoplankton through Fe fertilization and macroalgal (kelp) farms, which can be used for both C sequestering and energy production. It has been estimated that these two approaches can sequester from 0.7 to 3 Gt C yr-1 from the atmosphere at an estimated cost of $5 to 300 t-1 C yr-1. Other options currently under study are also mentioned. Numerous questions remain to be answered pertaining to the use of both microalgae and macroalgae for CO2 assimilation before credible estimates of costs of C removal can be made for either system. In addition, there are several key environmental issues raised by the use of algae. A detailed discussion of these variables, including cost estimates, is presented.

NA	13178	1999.223	Biological processes for mitigation of greenhouse gases	Biological processes driven by photosynthesis cycle through the atmosphere well over an order of magnitude more CO2 than is currently emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels. Already human activities control and appropriate almost half the primary photosynthetic productivity of the planet. Better management of natural and man-made ecosystems affords many opportunities for mitigation of greenhouse gases, through sink enhancements, source reductions and substitution of fossil fuels with biofuels. Biofuels can be recovered from most organic wastes, from agricultural and forestry residues, and from biomass produced solely for energy use. However, the currently low costs of fossil fuels limits the markets for biofuels. Accounting for the greenhouse gas mitigation value of biofuels would significantly increase their contribution to world fuel supplies, estimated to be currently equivalent to about 15\% of fossil fuel usage. Another limiting factor in expanding the use of biofuels is the relatively low solar energy conversion efficiencies of photosynthesis. Currently well below 1\% of solar energy is converted into biomass energy even by intensive agricultural or forestry systems, with peak conversion efficiencies about 2 to 3 \% for sugar cane or microalgae cultures. One approach to increase photosynthetic efficiencies, being developed at the University of California Berkeley, is to reduce the amount of light-gathering chlorophyll in microalgae and higher plants. This would reduce mutual shading and also increase photosynthetic efficiencies under full sunlight intensities. Estimates of the potential of photosynthetic greenhouse mitigation processes vary widely. However, even conservative estimates for biofuels substituting for fossil fuels project the potential to reduce a large fraction of current increases in atmospheric CO2 levels. Biofuels production will require integration with existing agronomic, forestry and animal husbandry systems, and improved utilization-conversion processes. The diffuse nature of biomass resources requires relatively small-scale processes for their utilization as solid fuels or conversion to liquid and gaseous fuels. Earlier proposals for enormous energy plantations feeding large power plants, or for establishing huge ocean kelp farms, were impractical. As are some recent ``geoengineering{'' proposals, such as ocean fertilization. In biomass utilization, combustion is generally preferable to more complex processes, such as thermal or biochemical conversions to oils and alcohols. The co-firing of biomass in fossil power plants avoids many of the scale, procurement, and efficiency limitations of stand-alone systems and provides significant near-term opportunities for CO2 mitigation. Landfill gas recovery, due to the large greenhouse gas forcing of methane gas, is another currently available technology that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Wastes and residues provide many opportunities for biofuels production and CO2 mitigation. Mitigating global warming with biological processes requires overcoming many scientific, technological, financial, institutional, regulatory and, perhaps most important, environmental barriers. This necessitates a major, world-wide and long-term, sustained research, development and implementation effort.

NA	276967	2010.8045	The prospects for sustainable biodiesel production in Jordan	This article addresses the feasibility of commercial biodiesel production in Jordan as an alternative fuel source. The study suggests that the most effective method of producing biodiesel in a country like Jordan could be based on large-scale microalgae cultivation. Since many strains of microalgae exist, it would first be necessary to identify the species most appropriate for growth in the Jordanian climate, and, second, to develop an affordable cultivation media based on locally-available ingredients. Because of the tremendous positive impact the success of this project would have on the local and national economy, the Jordanian government should also consider the establishment an algae biotechnology research center focusing on production of recombinant algal strains that grow rapidly and yield greater amounts of lipids. The southern part of Jordan, near Aqaba, provides a warm climate year-round, plentiful sea water, and a wealth of naturally-available minerals for enrichment of the cultivation media. A suitable bioreactor design is necessary for the continuous cultivation of the algae; the bioreactor should be coupled with a chemical/biochemical reaction stage for the large-scale transesterification required for conversion of the oil into biodiesel. Finally, it would also be advantageous to set up a carbon-neutral biodiesel-based electric generation power plant close by to supply power to neighboring cities while carbon emissions serve as a source of CO2 for the microalgal production cycle. Microalgae-derived biodiesel would serve as a renewable and nearly carbon-neutral source of energy. This paper addresses the key steps in the production cycle that would optimize the oil yield and biodiesel production capacity from microalgae.	a-carbon;  biodiesel production;  bioreactor design;  carbon emissions;  continuous cultivation;  cultivation media;  electric generation;  micro-algae;  microalgae cultivation;  national economy;  oil yield;  production cycle;  research center;  source of energy;  warm climates, algae;  alternative fuels;  biodiesel;  biological water treatment;  bioreactors;  microorganisms;  seawater, renewable energy resources	2010	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1
NA	274885	2011.8946	Effect of cultivation mode on microalgal growth and CO2 fixation	The biofixation of carbon dioxide (CO2) by marine microalgae cultivation has been regarded as one of the potential to diminish the greenhouse effect and produce the biomass. To compare and select the high efficiency cultivation mode, the effect of two different cultivation modes on the performances of growth and CO2 biofixation from air for energy marine microalgae Chlorella sp. was determined in this work. In one mode the microalga was cultivated using static (open) method and in the other mode it was cultivated using aerated (closed) method. It was found that, under the experimental conditions, the specific growth rate and CO2 fixation rate of the aerated (closed) cultivation were 0.5121 (d-1) and 1.3784g CO2/ld, and are 1.78 and 5.39 times that of the static (open) cultivation, respectively. In addition, the effects of pH value and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of the culture medium were analyzed and compared in two cultivation modes. The result indicates the aerated (closed) mode can effectively enhance the performance on microalgal growth and CO2 biofixation.

NA	172587	2013.7922	WIRELESS ISFET PH SENSOR NETWORK FOR OFFSHORE MICROALGAE CULTIVATION	Microalgae technology continues to show tremendous promise for becoming a major source of renewable transportation fuel in the coming decades. Ho Weyer, for microalgae to provide a significant fraction of the current US demand for fuel, their cultivation will be required on an enormous scale. One of the many formidable challenges that must be met to achieve this scale is the development of appropriate sensor networks to provide information about the growth conditions and the algae themselves. These sensors would monitor the heterogeneity of a) environmental parameters, such as pH, oxygen, and nutrient levels and b) algal characteristics such as size, oil content, and viability. Here we present a wireless sensor network to measure the local pH in NASA OMEGA project (Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae). The pH is measured using Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (ISFET) technology, which is more robust and has a faster response than traditional glass pH electrodes. A custom circuit drives the ISFET sensor and interfaces with an ANT wireless network system. The wireless network consists of a network hub which can service up to 8 sensor nodes and a series of relays to transmit the data to a PC. The data is logged with a custom Lab VIEW program. In this work, we demonstrate operation of this network using a single ISFET pH sensor, one hub, and two relay units. The performance of the pH sensor network is evaluated and compared in parallel with an existing wired glass electrode based pH monitoring system at the NASA OMEGA project.

NA	221159	2015.11244	Modeling of smart mixing regimes to improve marine biorefinery productivity and energy efficiency	Biorefineries aim to provide sustainable production of food and generation of low carbon energy in the next decades. Current strategies for biorefinery reply mostly on the classic terrestrial agriculture for biomass production. However, land availability, competition with food crops and total energy balance are challenging limiting factors for terrestrial bioenergy crop production. Off-shore macroalgae production could provide alternative, sustainable feedstocks for biorefineries without competition with food crops. Increasing the yields of off-shore macroalgae cultivation systems could further improve the total energy balance of the marine biorefineries. In this work, based on the fundamental principle of timing differences between light harvesting and carbon fixation in algae, we developed a theoretical framework for increasing the yields of off-shore macroalgae biomass using external mechanical mixing. We show that for a given physiological parameter of macroalgae light harvesting and carbon fixation, mixing could allow for increase of the total energy gain by two orders of magnitude. The overall biorefinery to biofuel efficiency, however, is constrained by drag and macroalgae thallus size. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

NA	58130	2015.3214	DEVELOPMENT OF A SCALABLE CULTIVATION SYSTEM FOR SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION OF ALGAL BIOFUELS	Algae are a promising source of renewable jet and diesel fuels and can play a significant role in climate change mitigation as a low-carbon fuel source. Currently, most industrial microalgae cultivation systems are open ponds because of their low capital and operating costs, but they suffer from low biomass productivity and high risk of contamination. We describe the development of a novel, cost-effective, and modular horizontal bioreactor (HBR) for algae cultivation. It was designed and engineered to keep costs low, while minimizing water and energy use and enhancing CO2 and nutrient uptake. The selected marine microalgal strain, Nannochloris oculata, has shown potential for biofuels production. Algal growth was first optimized indoors before testing the HBR performance outdoors under real-world conditions. The indoor study showed that urea and potassium nitrate yield comparable results, when used as nitrogen source, whereas ammonium chloride was less effective. Varying inoculum size from 10\% to 15\% to 20\% (v/v) had no effect on lag time, so the lowest level was selected. The 150-L HBR prototype was tested outdoors with N. oculata using the indoor optimal conditions. High-density growth was consistently achieved in the HBR without contamination problems over extended periods of time outdoors in central Florida.	microalgae; bioreactor; cultivation; biofuel; sustainability	2015	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	335738	2016.11256	Growth, protein and carbohydrate contents in Ulva rigida and Gracilaria bursa-pastoris integrated with an offshore fish farm	Low-technology practices are generally the rule when cultivating marine macroalgae, and they do not necessarily comply with sustainability requirements. When integrated with other marine organisms in land-based setups, seaweed culture can be sustainable also providing environmental benefits. Major challenges of such integrated aquaculture systems, however, are in sea-based setups. The current study examined the growth rates of Ulva rigida and Gracilaria bursa-pastoris, as well as their protein and carbohydrate contents, when exposed to different distances from an offshore, fed-fish cage system. Nutrient levels in seawater were consistently high downstream from the fish cages, significantly enhancing the specific growth rates and cellular contents of starch and soluble protein in these two seaweeds. Specifically, daily maximal growth rates were 17Â %Â dayâˆ’1 for U. rigida and 10Â %Â dayâˆ’1 for G. bursa-pastoris, maximal starch contents were 22 and 21Â %, respectively, and maximal protein contents were on a dry weight basis 7 and 13Â %, respectively. When repositioned at low ambient nutrient levels for 48Â h, the starch and the carbohydrate levels increased by 129 and 131Â % for U. rigida and by 198 and 150Â % for G. bursa-pastoris, respectively. Altogether, this study supports implementing future viable mean of sustainable macroalgae cultivation by taking advantage of excessive nutrients released from an offshore fish farm.

NA	261526	2016.1762	Cultivation study of the marine microalga Picochlorum oculatum and outdoor deployment in a novel bioreactor for high-density production of algal cell mass	Microalgae are considered a promising source of renewable diesel and jet fuel. Currently, large-scale microalgae cultivations are performed in open ponds because of their low capital and operating costs, but they generally suffer from low cell mass yield and high risk of contamination. A novel, cost-effective, and modular horizontal bioreactor (HBR) for algae cultivation was developed, as described in the present study. The HBR was designed to keep costs low and was engineered to minimize water and energy use while enhancing CO2 and nutrient uptake. The selected marine microalgal strain, Picochlorum oculatum (Nannochloris oculata), has shown potential for biofuel production. A series of controlled indoor growth experiments was first performed to identify the appropriate P. oculatum growth conditions before demonstrating the HBR performance. Supplying CO2 continuously or by pH-control (pulsed) did not affect culture progression. Growth on urea and nitrate yielded comparable results, while ammonium was less effective. Varying inoculum size from 10% to 15% or 20% had no significant effect on lag time and final cell concentration and comparable growth was measured in the 7â€“8 pH range. The 150-L HBR's performance was successfully demonstrated outdoors by growing P. oculatum at the identified growth conditions selected to reduce operating costs (pH-controlled CO2, pH 7.5, 10% inoculum, and nitrate). High-density growth was achieved without any contamination issues in outdoor HBR cultivations over 68 days in central Florida during two consecutive growth cycles.

NA	4104	2016.333	Optimizing microalgae cultivation and wastewater treatment in large-scale offshore photobioreactors	Algae Systems LLC has designed and implemented a novel approach to wastewater treatment in which municipal wastewater is used to cultivate microalgae in modular, offshore photobioreactors (PBRs). At the Algae Systems plant in Daphne AL, this process was used to treat up to 50,000 gal/day of incoming raw wastewater. A combination of algae nutrient uptake, aeration by photosynthetically produced oxygen, and dewatering via suspended air flotation removed 75\% of total nitrogen, 93\% of total phosphorus and 92\% BOD from influent wastewater. Offshore PBRs contained evolving polycultures of microalgae and associated heterotrophs, with community composition shifting based on the dynamic external and internal environment. During one year of operation, microalgae composition shifted from dominance of Scenedesmus dimorphus to a diverse polyculture dominated by genus Chlorella, Cryptomonas and Scenedesmus. ``The more, the merrier{''} approach to species richness produced resilient communities, enabling efficient nutrient uptake due to niche complementarity and eliminating process downtime due to biological disruptions. The resulting biomass was suitable for fuel conversion via hydrothermal liquefaction due to consistent lipid content, low ash content, and consistent elemental composition. Biomass production rates ranged from 3.5 to 22.7 g/m(2)/day during continuous operation, with productivity predominantly driven by temperature and frequency of harvest. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study performed an energy and GHG emissions analysis, using EROI and GHG savings potential respectively, as indicators of commercial viability for two systems: the Swedish Seafarm project's seaweed cultivation (0.5 ha), biogas and fertilizer biorefinery, and an estimation of the same system scaled up and adjusted to a cultivation of 10 ha. Based on a conservative estimate of biogas yield, neither the 0.5 ha case nor the up-scaled 10 ha estimates met the (commercial viability) target EROI of 3, nor the European Union Renewable Energy Directive GHG savings target of 60\% for biofuels, however the potential for commercial viability was substantially improved by scaling up operations: GHG emissions and energy demand, per unit of biogas, was almost halved by scaling operations up by a factor of twenty, thereby approaching the EROI and GHG savings targets set, under beneficial biogas production conditions. Further analysis identified processes whose optimisations would have a large impact on energy use and emissions (such as anaerobic digestion) as well as others embodying potential for further economies of scale (such as harvesting), both of which would be of interest for future developments of kelp to biogas and fertilizer biorefineries.

NA	4090	2017.332	Sustainable saline microalgae co-cultivation for biofuel production: A critical review	Microalgae have gained increased attention as a viable, eco-friendly and alternative source of green bioenergy. To compete in the fuel market, saline microalgae cultivation for biofuel production would need to be economically sustainable and co-cultivation of saline microalgae using only saline water and recycled nutrient can potentially be the best solution to reduce the excessive use and prompt downsizing of natural resources like fresh water and fertilizers. This review provides a critical analysis on the selection of potential biofuel producing marine, halotolerant and halophilic microalgae. Here we proposed a microalgae co-cultivation strategy from seawater salinity (35ppt) to salt saturation (300ppt) with biofuel as the main output. We focused that adaptation of a co-cultivation strategy could reduce 95\%, 74\% and 51\% of the overall nutrient waste compared to the monoculture of marine, halotolerant and halophilic microalgae. This paper also highlights a cultivation strategy using both mono and mixed culture over the period of increased saline condition and compares mass industrial scale biofuel production from microalgae in three sites in Western Australia.	bioenergy; nutrients; salinity; open ponds; productivity	2017	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
NA	260723	2017.3920	Carbon streaming in microalgae: extraction and analysis methods for high value compounds	There is a growing recognition that carbon-neutral biofuels and microalgae are eco-friendly options because of their high CO2 sequestering capability and ability to grow in wastewater/sea water and non-arable land. Also the intrinsic properties of microalgal systems can be exploited for high value compounds such as carbohydrates, lipids, pigments and proteins.

NA	324503	2018.14074	Exergy efficiency of solar energy conversion to biomass of green macroalgae Ulva (Chlorophyta) in the photobioreactor	Offshore production of macroalgae biomass, which was recently given the name seagriculture, is one of the important but least explored alternative energy resources. Unlike microalgae, macroalgae cultivation can be done offshore and therefore brings real news to the biofuel - food land agriculture conflict. A wide variety of small-scale laboratory experiments are done lately in order to deepen the knowledge and develop expertise in macroalgae cultivation and its downstream processing. For energy applications, it is common to evaluate the performance of an energy source or system in exergy efficiency terms. Another important parameter that is evaluated to determine the system's environmental impact is it's volumetric and areal footprint. The current work examines two exergy efficiency indexes, the Exergy Efficiency (EE), which takes into account all exergy inputs, and the Exergy Return On Investment (ExROI), that includes only fossil fuel exergy inputs, both on a green macroalgae Ulva grown in the macroalgae photobioreactor system (MPBR) incorporated into a building. Cultivation of macroalgae in the building embedded MPBR achieved maximal values of 0.012 and 0.22 for EE and ExROI, compared to a range of 0.05-8.34 and 0.013-0.327 found in published papers of microalgae systems. In addition, a modelled optimization of the initial biomass density leads to maximal values of about 0.035 for EE and 0.433 for ExROI, while further improvement may be achieved by optimization of nutrient addition and mixing methodology. This work demonstrates a tool to measure the performance of laboratory scale macroalgae biomass cultivation systems, followed by preliminary efficiency and environmental impact values, important for future upscaling.

Cultivation Project in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea: Experimental Simulation and Modeling	Offshore cultivation of marine macroalgae is a potential sustainable resource for fuel, food, and chemicals. Offshore, the high productivity of macroalgae cultivation depends on external nitrogen supply. The current work examines the idea of supplying nitrogen for Ulva sp. cultivation in the oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) by artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich deep seawater (DSW). Growth rates, protein, and starch contents of Ulva sp. were measured for time varying fertilizations with nitrate concentrations corresponding to nutrient concentrations of DSW at increasing depths of the EMS. A maximal relative growth rate of 7.4% was measured for fertilizing ten times per week with 5.8Â Î¼M, which corresponds to the artificial upwelling from the depth of 700Â m at EMS. Protein and starch contents ranged between 1â€“6 and 8â€“15% of dry weight. Finally, yields and energetic costs of DSW pumping were modeled for an example case of 10-ha offshore farm. The model predicts a high productivity but low energetic efficiency, which can be improved by coupling the biomass production with offshore power sources such as ocean thermal energy conversion.

NA	44490	2019.3540	Shifting fuel feedstock from oil wells to sea: Iran outlook and potential for biofuel production from brown macroalgae (ochrophyta; phaeophyceae)	Finding renewable alternative energy resources for fossil fuels substitution has become very vital due to the serious challenges faced by humankind at present such as environmental pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, crude oil price volatility, and fossil fuels exhaustion. Macroalgae (seaweeds) are fast-growing marine plants, providing several harvests per year without the need for arable land, fertilizer, and fresh water. Various types of ecosystems like coral reefs, mangrove forests, and rocky shores can efficiently host the seaweeds production systems. These characteristics have made them highly suitable feedstocks for third-generation bioethanol production. Iran has a huge potential in renewable energy resources owing to its unique geographical location and climatic features. The country borders with the Caspian Sea in the north and with the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the south. Seaweeds farming can also play a key role in mitigating air pollution, increasing employment rate, sustaining fossil fuel resources, bioremediating contaminated water, and improving marine ecosystem in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. In the present article, macroalgae diversity, cultivation, and their conversion and upgrading technologies into bioethanol in Iran are scrutinized and discussed. Finally, the potential of Bushehr (the Persian Gulf) and Chabahar (the Gulf of Oman) coastlines for macroalgae cultivation is investigated. These locations receive the annual solar radiation in the range of 1680-1753 kWh/m(2) and the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the range of 2.6-2.71 GJ/m(2)/year with 3051-3311.9 h sunshine per annum. Furthermore, the nutrient-rich and calm water with relatively stable pH, salinity, and temperature make these coasts suitable for macroalgae farming. A potential yield up to 147-153 t/ha/year can be obtained if proper native/engineered species, well-situated sites, and compatible cultivation techniques are selected.	fermentation; iran; macroalgae farming; saccharification; seaweed; third-generation bioethanol	2019	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	56634	2019.4575	What is the level of incentivisation required for biomethane upgrading technologies with carbon capture and reuse?	This paper documents a techno-economic assessment of biomethane feedstocks from urban, rural, and coastal settings. Additionally, the effect of three upgrading technologies was investigated, ranging from commercialised systems (water scrubbing) to more advanced systems: power to gas systems employing hydrogen to capture CO2; and microalgae cultivation utilising CO2 in biogas. In total, nine scenarios were investigated based on a combination of the three feedstock groups and the three upgrading technologies. The levelized cost of energy and the incentive required to allow financial sustainability were assessed. The assessment showed that water scrubbing was the cheapest upgrading method. The optimum scenario was the combination of urban based feedstock (food waste) with water scrubbing upgrading costing 87(sic)/MWh, equivalent to 87c/L. diesel equivalent. The incentive required was 0.13 (sic)/m(3) (or per L of diesel equivalent), however if power to gas was used to upgrade, an incentive of 0.40 (sic)/m(3) was required. This was expected as food waste attracts a gate fee. Rural-based plants (using slurries and grasses) are expected to provide the majority of the resource however, for this to become a reality incentive in the range 0.86-1.03 (sic)/m(3) are required.

NA	253225	2019.4839	Progress on the development of floating photobioreactor for microalgae cultivation and its application potential	Microalgae present great potential to replace land crops for the efficient production of large volumes of biomass for food, feed, fuels, and chemicals, as well as to treat wastewater and capture carbon. However, the commercialization of these technologies for bulk commodities requires a great reduction in the current microalgal biomass production cost. The bioreactor is the core of bioprocess engineering and is the premise for the commercial application of certain types of biotechnology. The challenges of phototrophic cultivation are completely different from those of heterotrophic processes because the efficiency of phototrophic cultivation is limited by the energy density of the input sunlight and the inorganic carbon supply. Thus, the development of microalgae cultivation technologies with low manufacturing and operating costs is key to addressing this problem, and floating photobioreactors (PBRs) are a promising solution. PBRs are deployed on the water surface without any land requirements, and wave energy provides free mixing energy. Additionally, the surrounding water can be used to control the culture temperature and to supply nutrients for microalgae growth. In this mini-review, the development of floating PBRs and their recent progress are presented. The effect of the carbon supply approach on the mixing and scaling-up of floating PBRs are critically discussed. The limitations and challenges in commercial applications of floating PBRs are analysed, and the need for future research is proposed. Finally, it is noted that microalgae farming on the ocean is a promising solution for human society to address the challenge of land space exhaustion due to the global population boom.

NA	9046	2019.970	An ecosystem approach to kelp aquaculture in the Americas and Europe	Kelp farming is increasing along the temperate coastlines of the Americas and Europe. The economic, ecological, and social frameworks surrounding kelp farming in these new areas are in contrast with the conditions of progenitor kelp farming regions in China, Japan, and Korea. Thus, identifying and addressing the environmental and social impacts of kelp farming in these regions is vital to ensuring the industry's long-term sustainability. Here, a conceptual model of the human and natural systems supporting this nascent kelp aquaculture sector was developed using Maine, USA as a focal region. Potential negative impacts of kelp aquaculture were identified to be habitat degradation, overfishing of wild seeds, predation and competition with wild fish and genes, and transmission of diseases. Increased food security, improved restoration efforts, greater fisheries productivity, and alternative livelihoods development were determined to be potential positive impacts of kelp aquaculture. Changes in biodiversity and productivity resulting from either negative or positive impacts of kelp aquaculture were confirmed to have downstream effects on local fisheries and coastal communities. Recommendations to improve or protect the ecosystem services tangential to kelp farming include: define ecosystem and management boundaries, assess ecosystem services and environmental carrying capacity, pursue ecologically and socially considerate engineering, and protect the health and genetic diversity of wild kelp beds. Recommendations to ensure that kelp farming improves the well-being of all stakeholders include: increase horizontal expansion, expand and teach Best Management Practices, and develop climate change resiliency. Additionally, an integrated management strategy should be developed for wild and farmed kelp to ensure that kelp aquaculture is developed in the context of other sectors and goals.	aquaculture; ecosystem; kelp; maine; saccharina latissima; ecosystem approach to aquaculture	2019	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
NA	303276	2020.2059	Seawater supplemented with bicarbonate for efficient marine microalgae production in floating photobioreactor on ocean: A case study of Chlorella sp.	Cultivation of microalgae on ocean provides a promising way to produce massive biomass without utilizing limited land space, and using seawater as culture medium can avoid consumption of valuable fresh water. Bicarbonate is proved as a better approach for carbon supply in microalgae cultivation, but Ca2+ and Mg2+ in seawater is subjected to precipitate with carbonate derived from it. In this study, cultivation with this medium for a marine Chlorella sp. resulted in productivity of 0.470 g Lâˆ’1 dayâˆ’1, despite of continual precipitation caused by increased pH due to bicarbonate consumption. Actually, this precipitation is favorable, since it can work as a flocculation harvesting method for microalgae. The highest flocculation efficiency of 98.9 Â± 0.0% was observed in cultures with 7.0 g Lâˆ’1 NaHCO3, which was higher than that of cultures without bicarbonate (44.1 Â± 0.2%). Additionally, the spent medium after flocculation supported better growth (1.60 Â± 0.0 g Lâˆ’1) than the fresh medium (1.26 Â± 0.0 g Lâˆ’1). Outdoor cultivation with floating photobioreactor on ocean resulted in the productivity of 0.190 g Lâˆ’1 dayâˆ’1, which was higher than that in land-based culture systems. The floating system also benefited from better temperature control with range from 20.6 to 37.2 Â°C, due to solar heating and surrounding water cooling. These results showed feasibility of efficient microalgae biomass production with fully utilizing of ocean resources, including culture medium preparation and temperature control with seawater, as well as wave energy for mixing, holding great potential to produce massive biomass to support sustainable development of human society.

NA	23883	2020.2529	Economic analysis of microalgae biodiesel production in a small-scale facility	Industrial production and commercialization of biodiesel from microalgae have become a good alternative to conventional feedstock. Microalgae show high growth rate and carbon sequestration and can be easily cultivate in fresh and/or marine water, using non-arable soil. This study aims to analyze the technical and economic feasibility of biodiesel production from Phaeodactylum tricornutum, using an algae biomass production scaled-up scenario, considering local reality prices and available technologies. The model assumes 80,000 m(3) of microalgae cultivation, in a set of bubble column photobioreactors installed on 15.247 ha of land, reaching a total of 1,811 tons of microalgae biomass and 171,705 L of biodiesel per year. The production cost estimated for microalgae biomass is 2.01 (sic) kg(-1) and for biodiesel is 0.33 (sic) L-1. The ROI calculated for the project is 10\% with a 10 years' payback time and an EBITDA of 588,139 (sic) year(-1). Despite the project's viability in the medium term, the cost of producing microalgae biodiesel remains high when compared to fossil fuels. Thus, unless greater technological maturity is achieved to make the process more economical, it will not be viable in the short term. (C) 2020 The Authors.

NA	46694	2020.4230	Synergy of biofuel production with waste remediation along with value-added co-products recovery through microalgae cultivation: A review of membrane-integrated green approach	Development of advanced biofuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel from renewable resources is critical for the earth's sustainable management and to slow down the global climate change by partial replacement of gasoline and diesel in the transport sector. Being a diverse group of aquatic micro-organisms, algae are the most prominent resources on the planet, distributed in an aquatic system, a potential source of bioenergy, biomass and secondary metabolites. Microalgae-based biofuel production is widely accepted as non-food fuel sources and better choice for achieving goals of incorporation of a clean fuel source into the transportation sector. The present review article provides a comprehensive literature survey as well as a novel approach on the application of microalgae for their simultaneous cultivation and bioremediation of high nutrient containing wastewater. In addition to that, merits and demerits of different existing conventional techniques for microalgae culture reactors, harvesting of algal biomass, oil recovery, use of different catalysts for transesterification reactions and other by-products recovery have been discussed and compared with the membrane-based system to find out the best optimal conditions for higher biomass as well as lipid yield. This article also deals with the use of a tailor-made membrane in an appropriate module that can be used in upstream and downstream processes during algal-based biofuels production. Such membrane-integrated system has the potential of low-cost and ecofriendly separation, purification and concentration enrichment of biodiesel as well as other valuable algal by-products which can bring the high degree of process intensification for scale-up at the industrial stage.

NA	385184	2021.16604	Wave attenuation by suspended canopies with cultivated kelp (Saccharina latissima)	Many kelp aquaculture farms consist of moored arrays of long horizontal lines that grow kelp near the water surface. Most kelp farms are deployed in the same direction of wave propagation. However, with numerous longlines of densely grown kelp, these farms may have the potential to attenuate waves if installed perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. In this application, the kelp farm may serve as a form of nature-based coastal protection. To assess this potential, a set of 1:10 scale physical model experiments were conducted to measure the wave attenuation of a suspended kelp model. The model was scaled based on the morphological and mechanical properties of the cultivated Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp) from Saco Bay, Maine, USA. Experimental results demonstrated that suspended blades have asymmetric oscillatory motions with more bending in the opposite direction of wave propagation. Due to severe asymmetric blade motion in large waves, the suspended blade could roll over the attached line following the wave orbital motion. The results also showed that suspended kelp farms in the designed configuration with 20 longlines of 1-m-long blades and 100 blades/m have the potential attenuating wave energy by up to 33.7% under the experimental wave conditions. Based on the experimental data, empirical formulas were developed for the bulk drag coefficient (CDB) and effective blade length (le) of suspended kelp canopies for wave attenuation. To predict wave attenuation under a wider range of conditions and to identify the key parameters affecting wave attenuation, a numerical model was developed that could resolve blade motion. The benefits of resolving blade motion were to improve the model accuracy and reduce the number of experiments needed for obtaining CDB or le, which is required in the conventional wave attenuation models based on the rigid blade assumption. The results indicate that (i) the wave energy dissipation ratio (EDR defined as the ratio of the dissipated wave energy to the incident wave energy) of suspended kelp farms decreases with increased water depth, (ii) EDR is not sensitive to wave height, (iii) EDR first increases and then decreases with wavelength, and (iv) EDR increases with blade size, kelp vertical position, plant density, and the number of longlines. Therefore, the technique to improve the wave attenuation capacity of suspended kelp farms for nature-based coastal defense is to install the kelp farms in shallower water, expand the farm size by adding more longlines, locate the kelp in a higher position of the water column, grow the kelp more densely, and choose the kelp species with more rigid, wider, and longer blades/biomass.

NA	9802	2022.1352	A review of existing and potential blue carbon contributions to climate change mitigation in the Anthropocene	The atmospheric concentration of CO2 is steadily increasing and causing climate change. To achieve the Paris 1.5 or 2 degrees C target, negative emission technologies must be deployed in addition to reducing carbon emissions. The ocean is a large carbon sink but the potential of marine primary producers to contribute to carbon neutrality remains unclear. Here we review the alterations to carbon capture and sequestration of marine primary producers (including traditional `blue carbon' plants, microalgae and macroalgae) in the Anthropocene, and, for the first time, assess and compare the potential of various marine primary producers to carbon neutrality and climate change mitigation via biogeoengineering approaches. The contributions of marine primary producers to carbon sequestration have been decreasing in the Anthropocene due to the decrease in biomass driven by direct anthropogenic activities and climate change. The potential of blue carbon plants (mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses) is limited by the available areas for their revegetation. Microalgae appear to have a large potential due to their ubiquity but how to enhance their carbon sequestration efficiency is very complex and uncertain. On the other hand, macroalgae can play an essential role in mitigating climate change through extensive offshore cultivation due to higher carbon sequestration capacity and substantial available areas. This approach seems both technically and economically feasible due to the development of offshore aquaculture and a well-established market for macroalgal products. Synthesis and applications. This paper provides new insights and suggests promising directions for utilizing marine primary producers to achieve the Paris temperature target. We propose that macroalgae cultivation can play an essential role in attaining carbon neutrality and climate change mitigation, although its ecological impacts need to be assessed further.	blue carbon; carbon fixation; carbon neutrality; carbon sequestration; climate change; macroalgae; primary producer; seaweed cultivation	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	345918	2022.18332	Growth of marine macroalgae Ectocarpus sp. on various textile substrates	Marine macroalgae are cultivated for diverse applications, from biofuel and biogas to biofiltering, from food to cosmetics or pharmaceuticals. Since macroalgae cultivation does not compete with land-based food crops for the necessary arable land or fresh water, it can increase the possibilities of sustainably harvested biomass. New technologies permit even land-based growing of marine macroalgae, besides the more common coastal or offshore cultivation. All these technologies, however, raise the question of how to provide ideal cultivation conditions, especially for adherent macroalgae, and of how to harvest them economically and sustainably. While some reports about growing marine macroalgae on diverse textile materials, such as polyester ropes or polypropylene nets, can be found in the literature, we report here for the first time on the growth of a marine macroalga on knitted fabrics. In our study, Ectocarpus sp. was cultivated in shallow rectangular cultivation vessels on knitted fabrics of various materials and structures revealing a significant influence of both parameters. Undesired changes of the pH value in the cultivation system as well as foam generation were attributed to textile auxiliaries. Considering all these influences, the best-suited knitted fabrics were identified as open-pore structures from hairy yarns made partly or completely from natural fibres.

NA	252950	2022.20642	Estimating growth, loss and potential carbon sequestration of farmed kelp: a case study of Saccharina latissima at Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland	Many governments are evaluating marine carbon sequestration processes for their capacity to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change. This includes the cultivation of macroalgae to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which requires accurate estimates from the field. This study estimated the potential rates of carbon sequestration of cultivated macroalgae by quantifying the amount of biomass released into the environment from a kelp, Saccharina latissima, farm in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland (54.4Â° N, 5.58Â° W). We estimated that a mean of 41% of net primary productivity (NPP) of the cultivated kelp was lost prior to harvest following blade fall-off, equivalent to a mean of 7.4 kg of carbon sequestered per 100 m longline at the site during the cultivation period. Coarse estimates requiring verification predicted that a further 43.2% of NPP may have been lost through chronic erosion and exudation of organic carbon. This rate of sequestration is similar to that of several government-funded agroforestry schemes. There is potential, therefore, that this quantified ecosystem service could be subsidized to incentivize the sustainable development of the macroalgae industry. These findings are essential for those promoting the sustainable development of the macroalgae cultivation industry and are highly relevant for implementation of UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate action) and Goal 14 (Life below water: â€œConserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable developmentâ€).

NA	252995	2022.2763	The Analysis on the Current Situation of the Utilization Mode of Microalgal Biomass Materials	In recent years, global warming caused by the greenhouse effect has become one of the greatest threats to mankind. This will have a serious impact on the environment and human body, such as land desertification, increase in ocean acidity, sea level rise, and increase in pests and diseases; affect people's normal work and rest; and make people feel dizzy and nauseated. Excessive emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main component of the greenhouse gas, have contributed to the continued rise in Earth's temperature. Although the world is vigorously developing clean energy to reduce carbon emissions, it will not replace fossil fuels in the short term. The conversion of biomass into energy is the most important way of energy utilization. Biomass energy refers to the solar energy stored in biomass in the form of chemical energy and is the fourth major energy source after oil, coal, and natural gas. At present, biofuels have gone through three developmental stages, which can be divided into first-generation biofuels, second-generation biofuels, and third-generation biofuels according to the types of raw materials and development history. The first generation of biofuels produced from food crops, such as bioethanol derived from sucrose and starch, has already entered the energy market. However, because the first generation of biofuels uses food crops as raw materials, there is a phenomenon of "competing with people for food,"and it is difficult to achieve large-scale application. To avoid the problem of food shortages, second-generation biofuels produced from nonfood crops, such as wood fiber, have been developed. Microalgae biomass energy is favored by governments and scholars all over the world because of its unique advantages of fast reproduction speed and high oil content. The cultivation of microalgae does not occupy traditional farmland, and the marginal land such as mountains, oceans, and deserts can cultivate microalgae, or develop microalgae cultivation in the air through the innovation of microalgae photosynthetic reactors. When municipal wastewater, food industry wastewater, and aquaculture wastewater are used as the medium for large-scale cultivation of microalgae, and waste gas from biogas power generation, flue gas from coal power plants, and industrial waste gas from fermentation are used as the CO2 gas source for large-scale cultivation of microalgae, it can be further reduced. The comprehensive production cost of microalgae bioenergy plays a significant emission reduction effect. Combining the above advantages, the use of microalgae to produce first- or second-generation bioenergy has become a new research direction. This study focuses on the review of microalgal biomass in fuel, nonfuel, wastewater treatment, and fuel cell.

NA	27746	2022.3138	Year-round sustainable biomass production potential of Nannochloris sp. in outdoor raceway pond enabled through strategic photobiological screening	Microalgae cultivation utilizes the energy of sunlight to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) for producing renewable energy feedstock. The commercial success of the biological fixation of carbon in a consistent manner depends upon the availability of a robust microalgae strain. In the present work, we report the identification of a novel marine Nannochloris sp. through multiparametric photosynthetic evaluation. Detailed photobiological analysis of this strain has revealed a smaller functional antenna, faster relaxation kinetics of non-photochemical quenching, and a high photosynthetic rate with increasing light and temperatures. Furthermore, laboratory scale growth assessment demonstrated a broad range halotolerance of 10-70 parts per thousand (PPT) and high-temperature tolerance up to 45 degrees C. Such traits led to the translation of biomass productivity potential from the laboratory scale (0.2-3.0 L) to the outdoor 50,000 L raceway pond scale (500-m(2)) without any pond crashes. The current investigation revealed outdoor single-day peak areal biomass productivity of 43 g m(-2) d(-1) in summer with an annual (March 2019-February 2020) average productivity of 20 g m(-2) d(-1) in seawater. From a sustainability perspective, this is the first report of successful round-the-year (> 347 days) multi-season (summer, monsoon, and winter) outdoor cultivation of Nannochloris sp. in broad seawater salinity (1-57 PPT), wide temperature ranges (15-40 degrees C), and in fluctuating light conditions. Concurrently, outdoor cultivation of this strain demonstrated conducive fatty acid distribution, including increased unsaturated fatty acids in winter. This inherent characteristic might play a role in protecting photosynthesis machinery at low temperatures and in high light stress. Altogether, our marine Nannochloris sp. showed tremendous potential for commercial scale cultivation to produce biofuels, food ingredients, and a sustainable source for vegetarian protein.	climate change; carbon fixation; microalgae; nannochloris; temperature tolerance; salinity tolerance; photosynthetic efficiency; lab to outdoor translation; outdoor cultivation	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
NA	47910	2022.4836	Quantifying baseline costs and cataloging potential optimization strategies for kelp aquaculture carbon dioxide removal	To keep global surface warming below 1.5 degrees C by 2100, the portfolio of cost-effective CDR technologies must expand. To evaluate the potential of macroalgae CDR, we developed a kelp aquaculture bio-techno-economic model in which large quantities of kelp would be farmed at an offshore site, transported to a deep water ``sink site{'' and then deposited below the sequestration horizon (1,000 m). We estimated the costs and associated emissions of nursery production, permitting, farm construction, ocean cultivation, biomass transport, and Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) for a 1,000 acre (405 ha) ``baseline{''} project located in the Gulf of Maine, USA. The baseline kelp CDR model applies current systems of kelp cultivation to deep water (100 m) exposed sites using best available modeling methods. We calculated the levelized unit costs of CO(2)eq sequestration (LCOC; \$ tCO(2)eq(-1)). Under baseline assumptions, LCOC was \$17,048 tCO(2)eq(-1). Despite annually sequestering 628 tCO(2)eq within kelp biomass at the sink site, the project was only able to net 244 C credits (tCO(2)eq) each year, a true sequestration ``additionality{''} rate (AR) of 39\% (i.e., the ratio of net C credits produced to gross C sequestered within kelp biomass). As a result of optimizing 18 key parameters for which we identified a range within the literature, LCOC fell to \$1,257 tCO(2)eq(-1) and AR increased to 91\%, demonstrating that substantial cost reductions could be achieved through process improvement and decarbonization of production supply chains. Kelp CDR may be limited by high production costs and energy intensive operations, as well as MRV uncertainty. To resolve these challenges, R\&D must (1) de-risk farm designs that maximize lease space, (2) automate the seeding and harvest processes, (3) leverage selective breeding to increase yields, (4) assess the cost-benefit of gametophyte nursery culture as both a platform for selective breeding and driver of operating cost reductions, (5) decarbonize equipment supply chains, energy usage, and ocean cultivation by sourcing electricity from renewables and employing low GHG impact materials with long lifespans, and (6) develop low-cost and accurate MRV techniques for ocean-based CDR.	kelp aquaculture; levelized cost analysis; carbon dioxide removal (cdr); cdr monitoring; reporting; and verification (mrv); saccharina latissima	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	51853	2022.5234	Integrated Marine Biogas: A Promising Approach towards Sustainability	Fossil fuel depletion, climate change, and increased global energy demands are the driving forces to find alternative sources of energy. Marine-based biorefinery has been recently discussed as a promising route to mitigate the environmental challenges, enhance the energy recovery, and provide a potential source for value-added products. Anaerobic digestion is a promising technology that can convert the organic compounds of marine ecosystems into biogas. To date, a comprehensive review incorporating integrated biogas potential and effective approaches to enhance seaweed digestibility for biogas production from marine resources has not been reported. Thus, the present review aims to explore and comprehensively present seaweed and other marine resources for potential biogas production. The basics and challenges of biogas production from seaweed are elucidated. The impact of biochemical composition on biogas and the microbial communities involved in anaerobic digestion of seaweed are discussed. Utilization of different techniques such as pretreatment, co-digestion, and sequential extraction of seaweed biomass to enhance the biogas yield and to mitigate the effect of inhibitors are presented. Specifically, this article evaluates the co-digestion of seaweed with other biomass feedstocks or liquid biowastes. Integration of marine microalgae cultivation on anaerobic digestate for value-added compound production, biogas upgrading, and bioenergy recovery provides a promising approach towards a zero-waste marine-based system.	anaerobic microbes; seawater; seaweed; biogas; marine energy	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	52059	2022.5257	The underexplored potential of green macroalgae in aquaculture	Green macroalgae (Chlorophyta) currently represent a residual fraction (<1\%) of global seaweed biomass production landings. In turn, red (Rhodophyta) and brown (Ochrophyta) macroalgae dominate the remaining percentage of aquaculture production, exceeding 32 million tonnes per annum. However, the industry relies on a relatively low number of species, in which as few as seven macroalgal genera collectively represent the bulk of global production metrics. At present, innovation and increased sustainability of the industry calls for diversification of macroalgal species/strains in aquaculture to counteract potential adverse effects ensuing from genetic impoverishment, decreased resilience to disease and climate change. Despite the dominance of red and brown seaweed regarding production figures, aquaculture of green macroalgae has witnessed an increasing trend in productivity and diversification over the last decades, particularly in Asia, where green seaweed taxa often occupy specific market niches in the food sector. Furthermore, growing interest in green seaweeds in aquaculture has been highlighted for different applications in emerging western markets (eg IMTA, biorefineries, food delicacies), owing to a unique diversity of cytomorphologies, ecophysiological traits, propagation capacities and bioactive compounds featured by this group of macroalgae. Cultivation technologies are relatively well developed, but sustainability assessments are scarce and required to unlock the potential of green seaweeds. Although it is likely that green macroalgae will remain occupying specialised market niches, in which high-value products are favoured, we argue that aquaculture of chlorophytan taxa presents itself as a compelling option under the current quest for commercial diversification of products and expansion of the sector.	bioactive compounds; cultivation techniques; integrated multitrophic aquaculture; life-cycle assessment; seaweeds; ulvophyceae	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
NA	56658	2022.5759	Dispersal and Deposition of Detritus From Kelp Cultivation	A high resolution coastal and ocean hydrodynamic model system was used to investigate the transport and deposition patterns of Particulate Organic Matter (POM) from kelp farmed at three locations of different properties: a sheltered location, an exposed location, and an offshore location. Published values on the sinking speeds of organic particles from kelp were used, spanning several orders of magnitude. Recent work on quantifying the release of particulate organic matter from farmed kelp was used to link the release of carbon to possible cultivation volumes and scenarios, and finally to link this to the potential for carbon loading on the ocean floor. The results are presented in terms of loading and distribution per unit harvested kelp, and the loading estimates are compared with estimates of natural (background) primary production. According to the simulation results, organic matter may be transported anything from a few (hundred) meters up to a hundred km away from the release site, depending on the sinking rates, time of release, and the location. The depth at which the matter settles on the sea floor likewise depends on the properties of the matter and the sites. The time until settlement varied from minutes to several hundred hours. The results underscore the importance of constraining the dispersal and deposition of detritus from kelp cultivation in order to better understand and quantify associated environmental risks posed by organic loading, and the potential for seafloor carbon sequestration by kelp farming as a nature based climate solution.	seaweed aquaculture; ocean model; organic loading; carbon export; sedimentation-dispersion model; carbon sequestration; kelp	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	252053	2022.6048	Microalgae cultivation in offshore floating photobioreactor: State-of-the-art, opportunities and challenges	The wide application of microalgae in health foods, nutritional feeds, aquaculture, pharmaceutical extracts, and biofuel production, has brought about the advancement of the microalgae cultivation industry. However, commercial-scale cultivation of microalgae still faces one major challenge, which is its economic feasibility, with lower cost and energy consumption. Developing floating photobioreactors to be utilized in offshore open water areas has gained more interest recently as it can diminish the cost effects of onshore land utilization, while seeking for additional benefits, such as regulated temperature, proximity to sunlight and nutrient supplies, and integrated ocean renewable energy. Thereby, this is timely to explore the potential of floating photobioreactors for microalgae cultivation in the offshore region. This review deliberately presents the characteristics of offshore environments and their potential effects on microalgae cultivation, as factors such as location selection, heat capacity, and utilization of cultivation resources are significantly different from conventional land-based cultivation. Compared to land-based photobioreactors, the design of floating photobioreactors has the opportunity to adopt hydrodynamical design; by utilizing the external force from ocean waves to generate internal liquid sloshing for improving the mixing of cultivation medium. While offshore-based microalgae cultivation is considerably new as part of blue economy and mariculture, this review provides insights into the opportunities for further advancement of offshore microalgae cultivation technologies. The encouraging factors for hybridization of offshore microalgae cultivation include mariculture, carbon dioxide capture and utilization, hydrogen production, and ocean thermal energy. Such understandings are vital to improving microalgae cultivation in offshore floating photobioreactors towards a valuable alternative to the current concerns in developing commercial scale of the microalgae industry. Various challenges in biological issues, economic and environmental challenges, installation and maintenance, as well as destructive hydrodynamic loads are also discussed.

NA	36076	2023.474	Carbon migration of microalgae from cultivation towards biofuel production by hydrothermal technology: A review	Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel burning are recognized as one of the major causes of climate change, particularly global warming. Thus, to reduce fossil fuels and CO2 emissions, it is essential to take preventative steps and investigate more tolerable energy options. Effective combining microalgae cultivation and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) technology can reduce CO2 emissions and the energy cost of algal biofuel production, making it more environmentally friendly. However, the carbon migration in processes must be considered prior to industry production. Therefore, this paper reviews the transformation of carbon, including the CO2 sequestration in microalgae cultivation, the carbon conversion in HTL and the CO2 emissions of algaederived biofuel. Including a summary of the conversion path and recovery of carbon, which are noticeably affected by parameters such as cultivation system, algae species, HTL reaction conditions (temperature, time and pretreatment methods) and upgrading catalyst. In addition, techno-economic assessments and environmental impact considerations on microalgae biofuel are reported.	carbon migration; microalgae cultivation; hydrothermal liquefaction; life cycle assessment	2023	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1
NA	5893	2013.313	Sea change under climate change: case studies in rare plant conservation from the dynamic San Francisco Estuary	We present case studies supporting management of two rare plant species in tidal wetlands of the San Francisco Estuary. We used empirical demographic analyses to identify factors to enhance population establishment and survival of Chloropyron molle subsp. molle (Orobancaceae), an annual hemiparasite, and to compare reintroduced with natural populations. Twelve years after outplanting, the reintroduced population persists but is in decline; impediments to success include the lack of adaptive management response to weed invasions and muted variance in hydrology. Transplantation of Lilaeopsis masonii (Apiaceae), a rhizomatous perennial herb, failed to meet success criteria for mitigation at local project scale, but dispersal and establishment of metapopulation patches indicated persistence at the landscape scale. This species has been found to be genetically indistinct from a widespread congener, and has few threats to persistence so long as suitable habitat is present. These two examples demonstrate the need for integrated conservation management strategies that prioritize habitat connectivity and maintain physical processes to support dispersal in response to sea level rise. For the hemiparasite, assisted colonization may sustain populations threatened by sea level rise, but only if a strong commitment to effective stewardship is realized.	plant reintroduction; wetland restoration; adaptive management; climate change; chloropyron molle subsp molle; lilaeopsis masonii	2013	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	269298	2014.11663	Potential impact of CO2 emissions on the seafloor	Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) aims to capture CO2 from fossil-fuel sources, transport and store it in suitable geological formations where it will be confined for extremely prolonged times. This is considered a feasible way of mitigating global warming. The seafloor is one of the target areas to safely store large volumes of anthropogenic CO2 through the development of sub-seabed CO2 geological storage. For the UK and large parts of Europe, the North Sea is potentially the most suitable location for CCS projects required to achieve planned targets in the reduction of CO2 emission. Other sub-seabed areas are studied for their storage potential in America and Asia. Even if the technology is considered proven, following the experience gained from the oil industry in using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and a few CO2 storage pilot projects, the risk of CO2 seepage must be addressed considering potential consequences on the marine environment. CO2 emissions may affect the seafloor with physical (e.g. sediments displacement), chemical (e.g. acidification) and biological (e.g. toxicity) effects. Laboratory experiments and the study of natural submarine CO2 vents are contributing to the development of a solid body of knowledge on these effects. The research is largely multidisciplinary, requiring expertise in natural sciences, engineering, chemistry and physics. The main observed consequences of CO2 emissions are a quick and strong acidification of the environment which may lead to the mobilization of pollutants, such as heavy metals, within the sedimentary cover of the seafloor diffusing within the overlying water column. Increased weathering of calcareous substrata is also likely following exposure to CO2- enriched fluids. Potential impacts upon local biodiversity would include displaced dissolved oxygen leading to anoxic regions, and localised ocean acidification. Consequences of increased CO2 would be a reduction in local seawater pH, and in the availability of carbonate ions required by calcifying organisms to grow. Predicted CO2 levels from potential seeps would lead to dissolution of exposed calcium carbonate shells and skeletons of local organisms. While some species would be able to tolerate and survive in such situations, others would die or suffer reduced growth rates. This is particularly pertinent for sessile benthic organisms which could not migrate following the onset of seepage. Naturally occurring submarine CO2 vents located along active tectonic and volcanic areas provide a good example of how organism communities change depending on their proximity to released CO2. For example, coral survival and growth decreases the closer they are to the CO2 vents, with macroalgae dominating the habitat instead. The timing and duration of potential industrial CO2 seeps would preclude the possibility of organism genetic adaptation over successive generations, and as such, possible impacts would depend upon organism acclimation potential and resilience. This chapter reviews the physical, chemical and biological implications of subseabed storage of CO2, and the consequences of potential seep events. Â© 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

NA	236169	2015.8660	BIODIVERSITY ON THE BRINK: THE ROLE OF ``ASSISTED MIGRATION{''} IN MANAGING ENDANGERED SPECIES THREATENED WITH RISING SEAS	Coastal areas in the United States are already experiencing the effects of sea-level rise, and the best available science predicts significant additional sea-level rise this century. In addition to sea-level rise, storm intensity and storm surge are also increasing. In some coastal areas, continuing population growth is compounding the threats of climate change and sea-level rise. At the same time, one in six of the federally listed endangered and threatened species in the United States is threatened by sea-level rise. Coastal species face displacement, extirpation, and even extinction due to loss of habitat. They are at risk of being trapped between rising sea levels and human development. This threat is exacerbated by unyielding human-made coastal fortifications. This coalescence of factors leads to the phenomenon known as ``coastal squeeze{''} the loss of transitional habitat between land and sea. For coastal areas this means that some of the most imperiled species will be pushed closer to the brink of extinction. ``Assisted migration{''} refers to one policy prescription to address this problem. The federal government, through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, has the authority and responsibility to consider active and passive assisted migration under the Endangered Species Act in managing species threatened with habitat loss due to sea-level rise. The federally protected Florida panther, logger-head sea turtle, Key tree-cactus, and Lower Keys marsh rabbit inhabit critically imperiled habitat in south Florida and are analyzed to examine this issue from the perspective of species from differing taxa, habitat types, and natural histories. This Article concludes that assisted migration, coupled with preserve and corridor protection and dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, are necessary for the conservation of imperiled species threatened with sea-level rise.

NA	2345	2016.190	OCEAN SPRAWL: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENT IN A CHANGING WORLD	The last few decades have seen rapid proliferation of hard artificial structures (e.g., energy infrastructure, aquaculture, coastal defences) in the marine environment: ocean sprawl. The replacement of natural, often sedimentary, substrata with hard substrata has altered the distribution of species, particularly non-indigenous species, and can facilitate the assisted migration of native species at risk from climate change. This has been likened to urbanization as a driver of global biotic homogenization in the marine environment the process by which species invasions and extinctions increase the genetic, taxonomic, or functional similarity of communities at local, regional, and global scales. Ecological engineering research showed that small-scale engineering interventions can have a significant positive effect on the biodiversity associated with artificial structures, promoting more diverse and resilient communities on local scales. This knowledge can be applied to the design of multifunctional structures that provide a range of ecosystem services. In coastal regions, hybrid designs can work with nature to combine hard and soft approaches to coastal defence in a more environmentally sensitive manner. The challenge now is to manage ocean sprawl with the dual goal of supporting human populations and activities, simultaneously strengthening ecosystem resilience using an ecosystem-based approach.

NA	150263	2016.7357	Genetic markers for antioxidant capacity in a reef-building coral	The current lack of understanding of the genetic basis underlying environmental stress tolerance in reef-building corals impairs the development of new management approaches to confronting the global demise of coral reefs. On the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), an approximately 51\% decline in coral cover occurred over the period 1985-2012. We conducted a gene-by-environment association analysis across 12 degrees latitude on the GBR, as well as both in situ and laboratory genotype-by-phenotype association analyses. These analyses allowed us to identify alleles at two genetic loci that account for differences in environmental stress tolerance and antioxidant capacity in the common coral Acropora millepora. The effect size for antioxidant capacity was considerable and biologically relevant (32.5 and 14.6\% for the two loci). Antioxidant capacity is a critical component of stress tolerance because a multitude of environmental stressors cause increased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species. Our findings provide the first step toward the development of novel coral reef management approaches, such as spatial mapping of stress tolerance for use in marine protected area design, identification of stress-tolerant colonies for assisted migration, and marker-assisted selective breeding to create more tolerant genotypes for restoration of denuded reefs.

NA	144848	2017.10594	Climate change and the evolution of reef fishes: past and future	Predicting the impacts of ocean warming and acidification on marine ecosystems requires an evolutionary perspective because, for most marine species, these environmental changes will occur over a number of generations. Acclimation through phenotypic plasticity and adaptation through genetic selection could help populations of some species cope with future warmer and more acidic oceans. Coral reef species are predicted to be some of the most vulnerable to climate change because they live close to their thermal limits. Yet, their evolutionary history may indicate that they possess adaptations that enable them to cope with a high CO2 environment. Here, we first explore the evolutionary history of reef fishes and how their history has shaped their physiological adaptations to environmental temperatures and pCO(2). We examine current-day thermal and CO2 environments experienced by coral reef fishes and summarize experimental studies that have tested how they respond to elevated temperatures and pCO(2) levels. We then examine evidence for acclimation and adaptation to projected ocean warming and acidification. Indeed, new studies have demonstrated the potential for transgenerational plasticity and heritable genetic variation that would allow some fishes to maintain performance as the oceans warm and become more acidic. We conclude by outlining management approaches - specifically those that can help preserve genetic variation by maintaining population size - to enhance the potential for genetic adaptation to climate change.	acclimation; adaptation; global warming; ocean acidification; plasticity	2017	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	234070	2017.14126	The contribution of human capital to a holistic response to climate change: learning from and for the Mekong Delta, Vietnam	The Mekong Delta has been identified by the International Panel on Climate Change as one of the three most vulnerable areas in the world as sea levels rise due to climate change. The Vietnam Government has implemented a range of policies to assist migration in order to address these environmental problems. While much research has focused on the environmental causes of, and responses to, climate change there has been less research on the impact of environmentally motivated responses to climate change on labour force and human capital factors. This paper examines the experience of the Vietnam Government in encouraging internal migration from vulnerable agricultural areas to urban industrial cities, to explore the human capital effects of these environmentally motivated response to climate change. The paper first presents the environmental argument for migration in response to climate change, together with examples of what the Vietnam Government has done to encourage migration from the rural (originating) areas to other rural resettlement and city (receiving) areas. It then uses data collected as part of recent study into the impact of government encouragement for internal migration to explore the labour force and human capital impacts in both the originating region and receiving areas. The findings suggest that while there are social and economic advantages there are challenges, including ensuring that job opportunities are available, migrants and appropriate skills, and that labour contracts provide for job security and healthy and safe working result in improved living conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a more integrated approach that acknowledges and addresses associated human capital (skills upgrading) and business development needs and integrates these with environmentally-motivated policies.	climate change; government policy; human resource development; human capital; mekong delta; migration; vietnam	2017	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
NA	60973	2018.4569	Blue carbon: past, present and future, with emphasis on macroalgae	Blue carbon did not originally include macroalgal ecosystems; however evidence is mounting that macroalgal ecosystems function in marine carbon sequestration. The great majority of present day marine macroalgal net primary productivity (NPP) involves haptophytic algae on eroding shores. For these organisms the long-term storage of particulate organic carbon involves export from the site of production of biomass that has evaded parasites and grazers, and that some of the exported biomass is sedimented and stored rather than being mineralized en route by detritivores (microbes and fauna). Export from eroding shores, and subsequent storage, of haptophytic marine macroalgal particulate organic carbon could have started by 1.6 Ga. Storage on depositing shores close to the site of NPP by rhizophytic macroalgae and then by rhizophytic coastal seagrasses, tidal marshes and mangroves began not less than 209 Ma ago. Future increases in surface ocean temperatures may bring tropical marine macroalgae to their upper temperature limit, while temperate marine macroalgae will migrate poleward, in both cases assuming that temperature increases faster than genetic adaptation to higher temperature. Increased CO2 in the surface ocean will generally favour uncalcified over calcified marine macroalgae. This results in decreased CO2 release from decreased calcification, as well as decreased ballasting by CaCO3 of exported particulate organic carbon resulting in decreasing sedimentation. While much more work is needed, the available information suggests that macroalgae play a significant role in marine organic carbon storage.	blue carbon; carbon sequestration; carbon export; palaeobiology; marine macroalgae	2018	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	10399	2019.1087	The Active Reef Restoration Toolbox is a Vehicle for Coral Resilience and Adaptation in a Changing World	The accelerating marks of climate change on coral-reef ecosystems, combined with the recognition that traditional management measures are not efficient enough to cope with climate change tempo and human footprints, have raised a need for new approaches to reef restoration. The most widely used approach is the ``coral gardening{''} tenet; an active reef restoration tactic based on principles, concepts, and theories used in silviculture. During the relatively short period since its inception, the gardening approach has been tested globally in a wide range of reef sites, and on about 100 coral species, utilizing hundreds of thousands of nursery-raised coral colonies. While still lacking credibility for simulating restoration scenarios under forecasted climate change impacts, and with a limited adaptation toolkit used in the gardening approach, it is still deficient. Therefore, novel restoration avenues have recently been suggested and devised, and some have already been tested, primarily in the laboratory. Here, I describe seven classes of such novel avenues and tools, which include the improved gardening methodologies, ecological engineering approaches, assisted migration/colonization, assisted genetics/evolution, assisted microbiome, coral epigenetics, and coral chimerism. These are further classified into three operation levels, each dependent on the success of the former level. Altogether, the seven approaches and the three operation levels represent a unified active reef restoration toolbox, under the umbrella of the gardening tenet, focusing on the enhancement of coral resilience and adaptation in a changing world.	climate change; reef restoration; gardening; ecological engineering; assisted migration/colonization; assisted genetics/evolution; assisted microbiome; epigenetics; chimerism	2019	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The coral microbiome has been widely acknowledged as crucial to coral health and function, playing multiple roles in key biological processes. Recent empirical studies suggest that microbes may contribute to coral host tolerance of thermal stress, and harnessing these benefits through microbiome engineering (ME) may provide a mechanism for enhancing climate resilience in corals. Although coral ME is in its infancy, similar and successful ME approaches that are already underway in other fields - including agriculture, medicine, and wastewater treatment - may serve to guide and improve ME techniques in corals. We discuss current applications of ME, identify three key research priorities that will help elucidate the viability of ME for corals, and consider the implications of using these approaches for reef restoration.

NA	6984	2019.736	Climate change and aquaculture: considering adaptation potential	Increases in global population and seafood demand are occurring simultaneously with fisheries decline in an era of rapid climate change. Aquaculture is well positioned to help meet the world's future seafood needs, but heavy reliance of most global aquaculture on the ambient environment and ecosystem services suggests inherent vulnerability to climate change effects. There are, however, opportunities for adaptation. Engineering and management solutions can reduce exposure to stressors or mitigate stressors through environmental control. Epigenetic adaptation may have the potential to improve stressor tolerance through parental or early life stage exposure. Stressor-resistant traits can be genetically selected for, and maintaining adequate population variability can improve resilience and overall fitness. Information at appropriate time scales is crucial for adaptive response, such as real-time data on stressor levels and/or species' responses, early warning of deleterious events, or prediction of longer-term change. Diet quality and quantity have the potential to meet increasing energetic and nutritional demands associated with mitigating the effects of abiotic and biotic climate change stressors. Research advancements in understanding how climate change affects aquaculture will benefit most from a combination of empirical studies, modelling approaches, and observations at the farm level. Research to support aquaculture adaptation requires an increasing amount of environmental data to guide biological response studies for regional applications. Increased experimental complexity, resources, and duration will be necessary to better understand the effects of multiple stressors. Ultimately, in order for aquaculture sectors to move beyond short-term coping responses, governance initiatives incorporating the changing needs of stakeholders, users, and culture ecosystems as a whole are required to facilitate planned climate change adaptation and mitigation.	governance; monitoring; data needs; mitigation; prediction; engineering; research; stressor	2019	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

The coral microbiome includes dinoflagellates, viruses, fungi, archaea and bacteria, with knowledge of the latter growing rapidly. This Review focuses on the bacterial members of the coral microbiome and draws parallels with better-studied microbiomes in other biological systems. We synthesize current understanding of spatial, temporal and host-specific patterns in coral-associated bacterial communities, the drivers shaping these patterns, and the role of the microbiome in acclimatization and adaptation of the host to climate warming. We discuss how this knowledge can be harnessed to assist the future persistence of coral reefs and provide novel perspectives for the development of microbiome engineering and its implications for coral reef conservation and restoration.

NA	135179	2020.13906	Are bivalves susceptible to domestication selection? Using starvation tolerance to test for potential trait changes in eastern oyster larvae	Conservation efforts are increasingly being challenged by a rapidly changing environment, and for some aquatic species the use of captive rearing or selective breeding is an attractive option. However, captivity itself can impose unintended artificial selection known as domestication selection (adaptation to culture conditions) and is relatively understudied for most marine species. To test for domestication selection in marine bivalves, we focused on a fitness-related trait (larval starvation resistance) that could be altered under artificial selection. Using larvae produced from a wild population ofCrassostrea virginicaand a selectively bred, disease-resistant line we measured growth and survival during starvation versus standard algal diet conditions. Larvae from both lineages showed a remarkable resilience to food limitation, possibly mediated by an ability to utilize dissolved organic matter for somatic maintenance. Water chemistry analysis showed dissolved organic carbon in filtered tank water to be at concentrations similar to natural river water. We observed that survival in larvae produced from the aquaculture line was significantly lower compared to larvae produced from wild broodstock (8 +/- 3\% and 21 +/- 2\%, respectively) near the end of a 10-day period with no food (phytoplankton). All larval cohorts had arrested growth and depressed respiration during the starvation period and took at least two days to recover once food was reintroduced before resuming growth. Respiration rate recovered rapidly and final shell length was similar between the two treatments Phenotypic differences between the wild and aquaculture lines suggest potential differences in the capacity to sustain extended food limitation, but this work requires replication with multiple selection lines and wild populations to make more general inferences about domestication selection. With this contribution we explore the potential for domestication selection in bivalves, discuss the physiological and fitness implications of reduced starvation tolerance, and aim to inspire further research on the topic.

Despite obvious differences, eucalypt trees and reef corals share some similarities in biology and ecology, particularly in relation to climate change impacts and adaptation. Both groups are the focus of an increasing research effort to characterize and respond to climate changes and here we examine how sharing research experiences can benefit both fields. Four key areas of research are considered: (a) modeling current distributions, (b) assessing impacts of climate change on future distributions, (c) using human-assisted migration to improve survival, and (d) applying genetic enhancement to improve the species' survival. Examples of each research area are used to examine potential crossovers, limitations of the methods, and future requirements. We conclude that eucalypt and coral researchers, and indeed researchers for many other endangered taxa, can gain much by comparing experiences and methods, despite the apparent differences in their respective taxa.

NA	298845	2021.1545	Adaptive responses of free-living and symbiotic microalgae to simulated future ocean conditions	Marine microalgae are a diverse group of microscopic eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms capable of photosynthesis. They are important primary producers and carbon sinks but their physiology and persistence are severely affected by global climate change. Powerful experimental evolution technologies are being used to examine the potential of microalgae to respond adaptively to current and predicted future conditions, as well as to develop resources to facilitate species conservation and restoration of ecosystem functions. This review synthesizes findings and insights from experimental evolution studies of marine microalgae in response to elevated temperature and/or pCO2. Adaptation to these environmental conditions has been observed in many studies of marine dinoflagellates, diatoms and coccolithophores. An enhancement in traits such as growth and photo-physiological performance and an increase in upper thermal limit have been shown to be possible, although the extent and rate of change differ between microalgal taxa. Studies employing multiple monoclonal replicates showed variation in responses among replicates and revealed the stochasticity of mutations. The work to date is already providing valuable information on speciesâ€™ climate sensitivity or resilience to managers and policymakers but extrapolating these insights to ecosystem- and community-level impacts continues to be a challenge. We recommend future work should include in situ experiments, diurnal and seasonal fluctuations, multiple drivers and multiple starting genotypes. Fitness trade-offs, stable versus plastic responses and the genetic bases of the changes also need investigating, and the incorporation of genome resequencing into experimental designs will be invaluable.

NA	156260	2021.15503	Cumulative bleaching undermines systemic resilience of the Great Barrier Reef	Climate change and ENSO have triggered five mass coral bleaching events on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR), three of which occurred in the last 5 years.(1-5) Here, we explore the cumulative nature of recent impacts and how they fragment the reef's connectivity. The coverage and intensity of thermal stress have increased steadily over time. Cumulative bleaching in 2016, 2017, and 2020 is predicted to have reduced systemic larval supply by 26\%, 50\%, and 71\%, respectively. Larval disruption is patchy and can guide interventions. The majority of severely bleached reefs (75\%) are predicted to have experienced an 80\%-100\% loss of larval supply. Yet restoration would not be cost-effective in the 2\% of such reefs (similar to 30) that still experience high larval supply. Managing such climate change impacts will benefit from emerging theory on the facilitation of genetic adaptation,(6,7) which requires the existence of regions with predictably high or low thermal stress. We find that a third of reefs constitute warm spots that have consistently experienced bleaching stress. Moreover, 13\% of the GBR are potential refugia that avoid significant warming more than expected by chance, with a modest proportion (14\%) within highly protected areas. Coral connectivity is likely to become increasingly disrupted given the predicted escalation of climate-driven disturbances,(8) but the existence of thermal refugia, potentially capable of delivering larvae to 58\% of the GBR, may provide pockets of systemic resilience in the near-term. Theories of conservation planning for climate change will need to consider a shifting portfolio of thermal environments over time.

NA	2632	2022.370	Shaping Improvised Directions for More Efficient Coral Reefs Rehabilitation Attempts	Coral reefs directly support more than 500 million people globally, usually in poor countries. More than 40 years ago, scientists initiated the discussion on coral reefs habitat destruction. Scientific research has covered various impacts on coral reefs including human pressures and climate change. Evidently ocean warming and acidification emerged as the main threats in the past decades. Currently, tropical coral reefs and their community are expected to face a tremendous increasing risk as global-warming raises. Such emerged combined stressors (human and climatic drivers) lead to slow recovery of corals with expectations of shift in species biodiversity and composition. Hence, coral reefs rehabilitation interventions have strikingly increased over the past decade. These interventions are carried through both, advanced science-based projects (such as coral microbiome engineering, ecological processes recruitment as well as community-based projects. The later occurs because of poor communication among the main three parties in charge (practitioners, MPAs managers with policymakers, and scientists) which in turn has led to unsatisfactory results in these rehabilitation attempts. The analysis of these results here revealed that most deficiencies are related to projects design. Engagement of these respective parties in a scientific framework through ``adopting a cautionary coral reefs rehabilitation strategy{''} will manage the general steps of adaptive decision making, and elude knowledge gaps that exist in certain drivers (Bioecological and Socio-economic) and common deficiencies in projects design. This will help quantifying rehabilitation measures and shaping these improvised directions for more efficient rehabilitation attempts. Avoiding this strategy is highly likely to result in another direct human impact on coral reefs in the Anthropocene. In this review, we summarize the story of past gains with evidence to new shaping of rehabilitative intervention directions for more resolutely efficient attempts. This is represented via simple pathway diagrams, and updated map which indicate the relationship between attempts objective and outcomes and charts showing drivers for success of coral rehabilitation. We attempt to answer the following question: How necessary is it to have a unified coral reefs rehabilitation cautionary strategy with an action plan?	coral restoration; coral rehabilitation; human impact on coral reefs; climate impact on coral reefs; restoration strategy	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	49857	2022.5052	Loss of transcriptional plasticity but sustained adaptive capacity after adaptation to global change conditions in a marine copepod	Rapid adaptation will facilitate species resilience under global climate change, but its effects on plasticity are less commonly investigated. This study shows that 20 generations of experimental adaptation in a marine copepod drives a rapid loss of plasticity that carries costs and might have impacts on future resilience to environmental change. Adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity will fuel resilience in the geologically unprecedented warming and acidification of the earth's oceans, however, we have much to learn about the interactions and costs of these mechanisms of resilience. Here, using 20 generations of experimental evolution followed by three generations of reciprocal transplants, we investigated the relationship between adaptation and plasticity in the marine copepod, Acartia tonsa, in future global change conditions (high temperature and high CO2). We found parallel adaptation to global change conditions in genes related to stress response, gene expression regulation, actin regulation, developmental processes, and energy production. However, reciprocal transplantation showed that adaptation resulted in a loss of transcriptional plasticity, reduced fecundity, and reduced population growth when global change-adapted animals were returned to ambient conditions or reared in low food conditions. However, after three successive transplant generations, global change-adapted animals were able to match the ambient-adaptive transcriptional profile. Concurrent changes in allele frequencies and erosion of nucleotide diversity suggest that this recovery occurred via adaptation back to ancestral conditions. These results demonstrate that while plasticity facilitated initial survival in global change conditions, it eroded after 20 generations as populations adapted, limiting resilience to new stressors and previously benign environments.

NA	61779	2022.6277	Genetic Variation in Heat Tolerance of the Coral Platygyra Daedalea Indicates Potential for Adaptation to Ocean Warming	Ocean warming represents the greatest threat to the persistence of reef ecosystems. Most coral populations are projected to experience temperatures above their current bleaching thresholds annually by 2050. Adaptation to higher temperatures is necessary if corals are to persist in a warming future. While many aspects of heat stress have been well studied, few data are available for predicting the capacity for adaptive cross-generational responses in corals. Consistent sets of heat tolerant genomic markers that reliably predict thermal tolerance have yet to be identified. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified the heritability and genetic variation associated with heat tolerance in Platygyra daedalea from the Great Barrier Reef. We tracked the survival of ten quantitative genetic crosses of larvae produced form six parental colonies in a heat tolerance selection experiment. We also identified allelic shifts in heat-selected (35 degrees C) survivors compared with paired, non-selected controls (27 degrees C). The narrow-sense heritability of survival under heat stress was 0.66 and a total of 1,069 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with different survival probabilities. While 148 SNPs were shared between several experimental crosses, no common SNPs were identified for all crosses, which suggests that specific combinations of many markers are responsible for heat tolerance. However, we found two regions that overlap with previously identified loci associated with heat tolerance in Persian Gulf populations of P. daedalea, which reinforces the importance of these markers for heat tolerance. These results illustrate the importance of high heritability and the complexity of the genomic architecture underpinning host heat tolerance. These findings suggest that this P. daedalea population has the genetic prerequisites for adaptation to increasing temperatures. This study also provides knowledge for the development of high throughput genomic tools which may screen for variation within and across populations to enhance adaptation through assisted gene flow and assisted migration.	heritability; genomic markers; allele frequency change; coral reefs; resilience; thermal tolerance	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	51729	2002.1015	Ecological states and the resilience of coral reefs	We review the evidence for multiple ecological states and the factors that create ecological resilience in coral reef ecosystems. There are natural differences among benthic communities along gradients of water temperature, light, nutrients, and organic matter associated with upwelling-downwelling and onshore-offshore systems. Along gradients from oligotrophy to eutrophy, plant-animal symbioses tend to decrease, and the abundance of algae and heterotrophic suspension feeders and the ratio of organic to inorganic carbon production tend to increase. Human influences such as fishing, increased organic matter and nutrients, sediments, warm water, and transportation of xenobiotics and diseases are common causes of a large number of recently reported ecological shifts. It is often the interaction of persistent and multiple synergistic disturbances that causes permanent ecological transitions, rather than the succession of individual short-term disturbances. For example, fishing can remove top-level predators, resulting in the ecological release of prey such as sea urchins and coral-eating invertebrates. When sea urchins are not common because of unsuitable habitat, recruitment limitations, and diseases, and when overfishing removes herbivorous fish, frondose brown algae can dominate. Terrigenous sediments carried onto reefs as a result of increased soil erosion largely promote the dominance of turf or articulated green algae. Elevated nutrients and organic matter can increase internal eroders of reef substratum and a mixture of filamentous algae. Local conservation actions that attempt to reduce fishing and terrestrial influences promote the high production of inorganic carbon that is necessary for reef growth. However, global climate change threatens to undermine such actions because of increased bleaching and mortality caused by warm-water anomalies, weakened coral skeletons caused by reduced aragonite availability in reef waters, and increased incidence of diseases in coral reef species. Consequently, many coral reefs, including those that are heavily managed, have experienced net losses in accumulated inorganic carbon in recent decades and appear likely to continue this trend in coming decades. Reefs urgently need to be managed with a view to strengthening their resilience to the increased frequency and intensity of these pressures. Ecological targets must include the restoration or maintenance of species diversity, keystone species, spatial heterogeneity, refugia, and connectivity. Achieving these goals will require unprecedented cooperative synergy between human organizations at all political levels, from intergovernmental to local.

NA	187409	2009.4801	Connectivity, biodiversity conservation and the design of marine reserve networks for coral reefs	Networks of no-take reserves are important for protecting coral reef biodiversity from climate change and other human impacts. Ensuring that reserve populations are connected to each other and non-reserve populations by larval dispersal allows for recovery from disturbance and is a key aspect of resilience. In general, connectivity between reserves should increase as the distance between them decreases. However, enhancing connectivity may often tradeoff against a network's ability to representatively sample the system's natural variability. This ``representation{''} objective is typically measured in terms of species richness or diversity of habitats, but has other important elements (e.g., minimizing the risk that multiple reserves will be impacted by catastrophic events). Such representation objectives tend to be better achieved as reserves become more widely spaced. Thus, optimizing the location, size and spacing of reserves requires both an understanding of larval dispersal and explicit consideration of how well the network represents the broader system; indeed the lack of an integrated theory for optimizing tradeoffs between connectivity and representation objectives has inhibited the incorporation of connectivity into reserve selection algorithms. This article addresses these issues by (1) updating general recommendations for the location, size and spacing of reserves based on emerging data on larval dispersal in corals and reef fishes, and on considerations for maintaining genetic diversity; (2) using a spatial analysis of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to examine potential tradeoffs between connectivity and representation of biodiversity and (3) describing a framework for incorporating environmental fluctuations into the conceptualization of the tradeoff between connectivity and representation, and that expresses both in a common, demographically meaningful currency, thus making optimization possible.	conservation planning; great barrier reef; larval dispersal; marine protected area; resilience; risk-spreading	2009	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	238932	2011.6662	FROM MICROBES TO PEOPLE: TRACTABLE BENEFITS OF NO-TAKE AREAS FOR CORAL REEFS	The number of no-take marine protected areas (here referred to as no-take areas, NTAs) on coral reefs has increased considerably in recent decades. Coincident with accelerating degradation of coral reefs, expectations of the benefits that NTAs can provide for coastal societies and sustainability of marine ecosystems has grown. These include increasing abundance of reef organisms both inside and outside NTAs, protecting key ecosystem functions, and providing social and economic benefits through improved fisheries and tourism. However, there is a lack of convincing evidence for many of these expectations. This is the first attempt to synthesize all potential costs and benefits of coral reef NTAs and critically examine evidence of their impacts on both ecosystems and societies. NTAs with high compliance consistently increase the diversity, density and biomass of exploited reef fishes and certain groups of motile invertebrates within their boundaries and have benefits for reef-associated tourism. Some NTAs provide small increases in the abundance of corals and decreases in macroalgal cover. The effects of NTAs on genetic diversity and connectivity among meta-populations are variable or as yet unquantified. There is limited evidence of NTAs providing social benefits through increased fishery yields and tourism revenue. There are examples of both positive and negative effects on social well-being. Finally, sharks, marine megafauna and microbial communities showed few tangible benefits from NTAs. Substantial gaps in the science of coral reef NTAs remain, especially in their capacity to provide socioeconomic benefits. A crucial research priority is understanding how the cumulative effects of climate change will influence the various benefits that NTAs provide. To be effective, NTAs must be used in conjunction with a range of other management tools and applied according to local environmental and societal contexts.

NA	42913	2014.2128	Assessing the vulnerability of the marine bird community in the western North Sea to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts	Ocean warming and anthropogenic activities such as fishing, shipping and marine renewable developments are affecting marine top predators. Research has focussed on the impacts of single stressors on single species, yet understanding cumulative effects of multiple stressors on communities is vital for effective conservation management. We studied a marine bird community (45 species; 11 families) that used the Forth and Tay region of the North Sea for breeding, overwintering or migration between 1980 and 2011. Local sea surface temperature (SST) increased significantly over this period, with concomitant changes in lower trophic levels. Simultaneously, the region has been subject to fishing pressure and shipping disturbance and is a priority area for renewable energy developments. We used colony-based and at-sea data to quantitatively assess relationships between SST and counts, productivity and survival of 25 species for which sufficient data were available for analysis. For the remaining species, we applied a qualitative approach using published population trends, published climate relationships and foraging sensitivity. In total, 53\% of species showed negative relationships with SST. Trends in counts and demography were combined with climate vulnerability to give an index of population concern to future climate warming, and 44\% of species were classified as high or very high concern, notably cormorants, grebes, skuas, shearwaters, terns and auks, as well as species breeding in the region. Qualitative assessments of vulnerability to fisheries, pollutants, disturbance (including introduced predators), marine renewables and climate found that 93\% of species were vulnerable to >= 2 threats, and 58\% to >= 4. Our results indicate that the majority of birds in this region of the North Sea face an uncertain future, potentially threatening the resilience of this important marine bird community.	global warming; marine renewables; european birds directive; seabird; fisheries; sst; resilience; demography	2014	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	261572	2016.3642	Reconciling biodiversity conservation and widespread deployment of renewable energy technologies in the UK	Renewable energy will potentially make an important contribution towards the dual aims of meeting carbon emission reduction targets and future energy demand. However, some technologies have considerable potential to impact on the biodiversity of the environments in which they are placed. In this study, an assessment was undertaken of the realistic deployment potential of a range of renewable energy technologies in the UK, considering constraints imposed by biodiversity conservation priorities. We focused on those energy sources that have the potential to make important energy contributions but which might conflict with biodiversity conservation objectives. These included field-scale solar, bioenergy crops, wind energy (both onshore and offshore), wave and tidal stream energy. The spatially-explicit analysis considered the potential opportunity available for each technology, at various levels of ecological risk. The resultant maps highlight the energy resource available, physical and policy constraints to deployment, and ecological sensitivity (based on the distribution of protected areas and sensitive species). If the technologies are restricted to areas which currently appear not to have significant ecological constraints, the total potential energy output from these energy sources was estimated to be in the region of 5,547 TWh/yr. This would be sufficient to meet projected energy demand in the UK, and help to achieve carbon reduction targets. However, we highlight two important caveats. First, further ecological monitoring and surveillance is required to improve understanding of wildlife distributions and therefore potential impacts of utilising these energy sources. This is likely to reduce the total energy available, especially at sea. Second, some of the technologies under investigation are currently not deployed commercially. Consequently this potential energy will only be available if continued effort is put into developing these energy sources/technologies, to enable realisation of their full potential.

NA	1590	2017.119	Effects of ocean sprawl on ecological connectivity: impacts and solutions	The growing number of artificial structures in estuarine, coastal and marine environments is causing ``ocean sprawl{''}. Artificial structures do not only modify marine and coastal ecosystems at the sites of their placement, but may also produce larger-scale impacts through their alteration of ecological connectivity - the movement of organisms, materials and energy between habitat units within seascapes. Despite the growing awareness of the capacity of ocean sprawl to influence ecological connectivity, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how artificial structures modify ecological connectivity in near- and off-shore environments, and when and where their effects on connectivity are greatest. We review the mechanisms by which ocean sprawl may modify ecological connectivity, including trophic connectivity associated with the flow of nutrients and resources. We also review demonstrated, inferred and likely ecological impacts of such changes to connectivity, at scales from genes to ecosystems, and potential strategies of management for mitigating these effects. Ocean sprawl may alter connectivity by: (1) creating barriers to the movement of some organisms and resources - by adding physical barriers or by modifying and fragmenting habitats; (2) introducing new structural material that acts as a conduit for the movement of other organisms or resources across the landscape; and (3) altering trophic connectivity. Changes to connectivity may, in turn, influence the genetic structure and size of populations, the distribution of species, and community structure and ecological functioning. Two main approaches to the assessment of ecological connectivity have been taken: (1) measurement of structural connectivity - the configuration of the landscape and habitat patches and their dynamics; and (2) measurement of functional connectivity - the response of organisms or particles to the landscape. Our review reveals the paucity of studies directly addressing the effects of artificial structures on ecological connectivity in the marine environment, particularly at large spatial and temporal scales. With the ongoing development of estuarine and marine environments, there is a pressing need for additional studies that quantify the effects of ocean sprawl on ecological connectivity. Understanding the mechanisms by which structures modify connectivity is essential if marine spatial planning and eco-engineering are to be effectively utilised to minimise impacts.

NA	213288	2017.12763	Eco-engineering and management strategies for marine infrastructure to reduce establishment and dispersal of non-indigenous species	Habitat modification and the introduction and establishment of non-indigenous species (NIS) are two of the greatest threats to global biodiversity. Human modifications of marine habitats include the introduction of boating infrastructure, coastal defences and offshore energy installations that are occurring at an increasing rate. These artificial structures are now widely recognised as providing opportunities for the establishment and dispersal of non-indigenous fouling species in new regions. This is driving increased interest into how structures might be designed and built to limit their suitability for invasive species. At the same time the potential for artificial habitats to provide habitat to native and threatened species means that the control of NIS on these structures should not just rely on antifouling. Green or eco-engineering aims to incorporate ecological theory and principles into the design of engineered structures. When combined with other management strategies that aim to increase the resistance of recipient environments there is the potential to enhance practical barriers against invaders in an increasingly developed ocean. Here I explore examples of NIS facilitation by artificial structures and the ecological theories that could be used to reduce opportunities for NIS establishment and spread. Examples include (1) manipulating the physical and chemical properties of structures to enhance native recruitment over NIS, (2) enhancing resource use of structures by native species through ``pre-seeding{''}, (3) providing opportunities for native grazers and predators to easily access structures, and (4) considering the timing of construction/maintenance/decommissioning for artificial structures such that resources are not made available when propagule pressure is also high. These examples are not exhaustive, but rather provide a discussion point for managers of biological invasions to generate further research and application over larger spatial scales.	artificial structure; estuary; coast; offshore; community ecology; invasion theory	2017	Devi	NA	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	10135	2017.831	Protected Areas for Climate Change Mitigation and Livelihood Option: A Case Study of the Bangladesh Sundarbans Mangrove Forest	Carbon sequestration is an important REDD+ strategy to global climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection, and livelihood generation. This study investigated the floristic composition, ecosystem level carbon sequestration, and relation between forest composition and carbon pools in three protected areas (PAs) of the Bangladesh Sundarbans Mangrove Forest. Systematic grid sampling method was employed to collect data from a total of 29 cluster plots composed of five nested circular (10 m radius) subplots of equal size (1570.50 m(2)) each during two forest inventories (in 1997 and 2010). Mean diversity, evenness, and richness of all recorded species were respectively 1.21, 0.37, and 0.59. No significant difference was observed between species diversity, evenness, and richness across three PAs. The mean ecosystem level carbon stock was measured 218.72 Mg ha(-1). The ecosystem level carbon stocks were found significantly different across the three PAs. The Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary contained the highest amount of carbon (299.49 Mg ha(-1)) followed by the Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary and the Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary. There was no significant relationship with carbon (above-and belowground) content with species diversity, evenness, and richness. Shrub-herb carbon stocks showed significant negative correlation with species diversity and evenness. We found significant variation in ecosystem level carbon sequestration across the three wildlife sanctuaries. The mean yearly ecosystem level carbon sequestration rate was 3.93 Mg ha(-1) equivalent to 14.44 Mg CO2 ha(-1). Thus, the three PAs with its total land cover of 90,747 ha (22 \% of the entire mangrove Sundarbans) have been sequestering 1.31 million ton CO2 per year which can earn 19.65 million USD yearly (@ 15 USD/ t CO2). Thus, the Sundarbans Mangrove Forest has enormous potential to address global climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and perhaps more importantly livelihoods to millions of people through participating in Payment for Environmental Services (PES) of the REDD+ financial mechanism.	ecosystem services; carbon trading; functional relation; reed; wetland-based carbon reduction	2017	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	218794	2018.14444	Oceanographic and biological influences on recruitment of benthic invertebrates to hard substrata on the Oregon shelf	The number of anthropogenic substrata in the ocean - structures like oil rigs and offshore renewable energy generators - is increasing. These structures provide hard-bottom habitat in areas previously dominated by sand or mud, so they have the potential to alter species distributions or serve as ``stepping-stones{''} between other hard-bottom habitats. It is thus important to understand what factors influence the composition and abundance of benthic fauna recruiting at these sites. We examined recruitment to hard substrata (fouling panels) deployed on sand at various distances from a large rocky reef (similar to 60 m isobath) on the southern Oregon coast in 2014-2015. Recruitment was dominated by the acorn barnacle Hesperibalanus hesperius. For the majority of the study period in 2014, an anti-cyclonic eddy was present near the deployment sites. However, anomalously high recruitment of H. hesperius during August - early October 2014 coincided with dissipation of the eddy, slower bottom currents, and a positive convergence index, suggesting that H. hesperlus larvae from the adjacent area may have been accumulated and retained near our study sites. Other sessile species, including hydroids and bryozoans, recruited to the fouling panels in low abundances, and most of these species have long-range dispersal and fast growth. Mobile invertebrates observed on the fouling panels included gastropods and nudibranchs, most of which also have long-range dispersal and fast growth, and are predators as adults. Thus, a community with two trophic levels assembled on the fouling panels in a relatively short time period (< 12 weeks). None of the common hard-bottom species from the adjacent rocky reef recruited to the panels, suggesting that there is a specialized assemblage of species that can exploit hard-bottom habitats surrounded by sandy plains. Our results raise many questions about the influences of dispersal and oceanographic conditions on recruitment to hard substrata.	community assembly; rocky reef; barnacle; hesperibalanus hesperius; bottom current; convergence	2018	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	1337	2018.152	Ecological guidelines for designing networks of marine reserves in the unique biophysical environment of the Gulf of California	No-take marine reserves can be powerful management tools, but only if they are well designed and effectively managed. We review how ecological guidelines for improving marine reserve design can be adapted based on an area's unique evolutionary, oceanic, and ecological characteristics in the Gulf of California, Mexico. We provide ecological guidelines to maximize benefits for fisheries management, biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation. These guidelines include: representing 30\% of each major habitat (and multiple examples of each) in marine reserves within each of three biogeographic subregions; protecting critical areas in the life cycle of focal species (spawning and nursery areas) and sites with unique biodiversity; and establishing reserves in areas where local threats can be managed effectively. Given that strong, asymmetric oceanic currents reverse direction twice a year, to maximize connectivity on an ecological time scale, reserves should be spaced less than 50-200km apart depending on the planktonic larval duration of target species; and reserves should be located upstream of fishing sites, taking the reproductive timing of focal species in consideration. Reserves should be established for the long term, preferably permanently, since full recovery of all fisheries species is likely to take>25years. Reserve size should be based on movement patterns of focal species, although marine reserves>10km long are likely to protect80\% of fish species. Since climate change will affect species' geographic range, larval duration, growth, reproduction, abundance, and distribution of key recruitment habitats, these guidelines may require further modifications to maintain ecosystem function in the future.	biodiversity; climate change; connectivity; conservation; fisheries; recovery rates	2018	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
NA	248254	2018.6093	Restoring oysters to urban estuaries: Redefining habitat quality for eastern oyster performance near New York City	Restoring and conserving coastal resilience faces increasing challenges under current climate change predictions. Oyster restoration, in particular, faces threats from alterations in precipitation, warming water temperatures, and urbanization of coastlines that dramatically change salinity patterns, foster the proliferation and spread disease, and disrupt habitat connectivity, respectively. New York City (NYC) coastal waters, once home to a booming oyster fishery for eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), are now nearly devoid of live oyster reefs. Oyster restoration in urban estuaries is motivated by the synergistic ecosystem benefits this native keystone species can deliver. Recent surveys have documented substantial remnant populations of adult oysters in the upper low salinity zone of the Hudson/Raritan Estuary (HRE) near Tarrytown, NY. This study assessed fitness-related performance across the HRE salinity gradient to evaluate habitat suitability on an estuarine scale. Oysters were hatchery-produced from wild, moderate-salinity broodstock, then outplanted for measurement of growth, survival, reproduction and disease prevalence over two years. Survival was generally higher in the lower salinity river sites and in the higher salinity Jamaica Bay sites relative to mesohaline NYC harbor sites. Growth rate was highest in Jamaica Bay and had high variation among other sites. Surprisingly, the highest proportion of individuals with sex-differentiated gametes and the highest average gonad maturation index was found at a low salinity site. Consistent with the advanced gametogenesis measured in experimental animals at low salinity, annual wild recruitment was documented near the low salinity remnant population in each of five monitored years. These results suggest that the remnant HRE oyster population is a robust, self-sustaining population that can be leveraged to support restoration of subpopulations in other parts of the estuary, but further research is required to determine if the mesohaline and near-ocean reaches of the HRE can support the full oyster life cycle.

NA	129686	2018.6541	Successful cryopreservation of coral larvae using vitrification and laser warming	Climate change has increased the incidence of coral bleaching events, resulting in the loss of ecosystem function and biodiversity on reefs around the world. As reef degradation accelerates, the need for innovative restoration tools has become acute. Despite past successes with ultra-low temperature storage of coral sperm to conserve genetic diversity, cryopreservation of larvae has remained elusive due to their large volume, membrane complexity, and sensitivity to chilling injury. Here we show for the first time that coral larvae can survive cryopreservation and resume swimming after warming. Vitrification in a 3.5 M cryoprotectant solution (10\% v/v propylene glycol, 5\% v/v dimethyl sulfoxide, and 1 M trehalose in phosphate buffered saline) followed by warming at a rate of approximately 4,500,000 degrees C/min with an infrared laser resulted in up to 43\% survival of Fungia scutaria larvae on day 2 post-fertilization. Surviving larvae swam and continued to develop for at least 12 hours after laser-warming. This technology will enable biobanking of coral larvae to secure biodiversity, and, if managed in a high-throughput manner where millions of larvae in a species are frozen at one time, could become an invaluable research and conservation tool to help restore and diversify wild reef habitats.

NA	227644	2019.15865	Effects of established offshore wind farms on energy flow of coastal ecosystems: A case study of the Rudong offshore wind farms in China	To assess the impact of offshore wind farms (OWFs) on the structure and energy flow of coastal ecosystems, Ecopath models of the Jiangsu coastal ecosystem (JCE) based on biological field data collected before and after the establishment of the Rudong OWFs in 2007 and 2015, respectively, were constructed and compared. The results indicated that after OWF construction, detritus, phytoplankton, zooplankton, anchovies, and some benthic fish were positively impacted. The increased primary production and detritus resulted in the increased food supply for zooplankton, which made it possible for planktivorous species (particularly anchovies) to be fed. Consequently, the biomass and production of some benthic fish increased, which indicates a potential reef effect. Other groups with decreased biomasses and productions may have been negatively impacted by the OWFs. Herbivory flows dominated the pre- and post-construction JCE despite their low transfer efficiencies; however, the proportion of detritivory flow increased after OWF construction, and this was especially prominent at high trophic levels. The post-construction JCE was immature with lower system connectivity, trophic flow utilisation, and transfer efficiency. However, the ecosystem tended to develop towards higher maturity with higher energy throughput, ecosystem activity, and recycling capability.	trophic flow; system structure; jiangsu coastal ecosystem; ecological influence	2019	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	145973	2020.14053	External conditions drive optimal planting configurations for salt marsh restoration	Coastal salt marshes are threatened by erosion from storminess and sea level rise, with resulting losses in flood protection, wildlife and recreational space. Although more than \$1 billion has been spent to reconcile losses, restoration has had varying success because of poor survival of planted patches in challenging wave and current conditions. Marsh expansion after colonization or replanting is regulated by positive and negative feedbacks between vegetation density and sediment capture. Dense vegetation stimulates sediment capture and vertical patch growth, but negatively constrains patch expansion by concentrating hydrological energy into erosion gullies along patch edges. Conversely, low-density vegetation may not simulate enough sediment capture, which increases plant dislodgement mortality. The strengths of positive and negative feedbacks will vary with wave exposure, but this has never been tested in natural conditions. We observed density-dependent sediment feedbacks, survival and lateral expansion by Sporobolus anglicus patches (0.8 x 0.8 m) planted at three levels of vegetation density, at each of three levels of wave forcing (three sites). We found interactive effects of plant density and forcing on the strength of positive and negative feedbacks. Density-dependent feedbacks only emerged in moderate and exposed conditions: classic marsh tussock patch shapes, which arise due to combined positive (vertical growth) and negative (gullies) feedbacks, were only associated with high density vegetation under exposed conditions. At high exposure, survival was enhanced by dense planting, which diverted energy away from the vegetation. In sheltered conditions, expansion was the greatest at medium density, while dense patches had high mortality and erosion. Synthesis and applications. Success of wetland restoration clearly hinges on considering interactions between environmental stress and planting density. In challenging high-exposure settings, dense planting in large patches should maximize success, as plant facilitation boosts sediment capture and negative edge effects (gullies) will represent a diminished proportion of larger patches. Yet, benefits of dense planting will switch from positive (facilitation) to negative (competition) with reduced environmental stress, when moderate-density planting might be optimal. Switches along stress gradients between positive and negative feedbacks are common across ecosystems. We call for wider integration of facilitation and stress-gradient principles into restoration design to safeguard restoration successes.	planting; positive and negative feedbacks; restoration; saltmarsh; sediment; sporobolus anglicus; stress-gradient hypothesis; survival and expansion	2020	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	202937	2020.15879	Science in support of ecologically sound decommissioning strategies for offshore man-made structures: taking stock of current knowledge and considering future challenges	The blue growth agenda has spurred an accelerating exploitation and continued development of the coastal and marine environment. This is also driven by the increasing need to generate renewable energy. In most cases, this has resulted in a large number of man-made structures (MMSs) across several soft sediment environments. The nature of these structures ranges from oil and gas installations to harbour walls, anchored buoys, pipelines and offshore wind farms. These structures host fouling communities that are often new to offshore regions, potentially serving as stepping stones for range-expanding (non-indigenous) species and providing habitat and shelter for a variety of marine species. The altered local biodiversity also affects biological and biogeochemical processes from the water column to the seafloor, either directly (e.g. scouring, organic matter export from piles) or indirectly (e.g. closure or displacement of fisheries) and, hence, ecosystem functioning at various spatial and temporal scales. A proper understanding of the effects of artificial hard substrate and the consequences of its removal (e.g. through decommissioning) to marine biodiversity has yet to develop to maturity. This themed article set contributes to the scientific knowledge base on the impacts of MMSs on marine ecosystems with the specific aim to fertilize and facilitate an evidence-based debate over decommissioning. This discussion will become ever more vital to inform marine spatial planning and future policy decisions on the use and protection of marine resources.	artificial hard substrata; artificial reef; decommissioning debate; ecological effects; evidence knowledge base; fisheries exclusion	2020	Devi	NA	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	15906	2020.1895	Tropicalization may invert trophic state and carbon budget of shallow temperate rocky reefs	Global warming mediates and maintains the tropicalization of temperate marine ecosystems. Recent studies have demonstrated that this process causes shifts from algal forests to denuded non-canopy states in temperate reefs. It has been suggested that these changes would incur significant consequences to ecosystem functioning. In this study, we tested how tropicalization affects habitat-provisioning functions and carbon turnover of a shallow reef in the fast-warming and highly invaded southeastern Mediterranean Sea, in-situ. On a single shallow reef, we conducted measurements of these functions in three habitats: dwindling native brown algal (Cystoseira) forest, dominant turf (formed by overgrazing of tropical rabbitfish) and expanding tropical shrubs dominated by red calcifying algae (Galaxaura rugosa). Algal forest was an autotrophic net carbon sink and provided habitat for high species diversity and the largest community biomass. The denuded turf was heterotrophic and provided habitat for the lowest species diversity and community biomass. While diversity was as high in tropical shrubs as in the algal forest, it had lower biomass and functioned as a heterotrophic net carbon source. Synthesis. Our study exemplifies possible functional consequences of tropicalization-driven regime shifts on shallow temperate rocky reefs, and how these can invert the net trophic state and carbon balance.	algal forests turf shrubs; calcification caco3 dissolution; carbon sink source; ecosystem functioning; in-situ benthic incubation chambers; net community production respiration; regime phase shift; shallow temperate rocky reefs	2020	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	243962	2021.11012	The thermal impacts of beach nourishment across a regionally important loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) rookery	Beach nourishment is a common coastal management practice used to protect and maintain infrastructure, tourist revenue, and sandy beach habitats. Coastal erosion and increased development along the coast of North Carolina, USA, have resulted in increased use of beach nourishment as an environmentally friendly alternative to hard structures, such as groins and jetties. Despite its advantages, beach nourishment can alter the thermal properties of a beach, potentially impacting the incubation environment of species that utilize this habitat during reproduction. Importantly, in organisms with temperature-dependent sex determination, the incubation environment plays a key role in determining offspring sex ratios, hatchling survival, and fitness. Here we investigate how beach nourishment influences thermal properties and sand characteristics of eight beaches in the high-density loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nesting region of North Carolina. We find that, despite considerable spatial and temporal variation, nourishment is a significant predictor of mean monthly sand temperatures in both univariate and multivariable predictive models. Across a season, nourished beach sections are, on average, 0.4 degrees C (range 0.3-0.8 degrees C) warmer than their unnourished counterparts. Nourishment is also a significant predictor of the mean and variance of sand grain size. Furthermore, variation in mean grain size, the relative percent of small, medium and large grain sizes and albedo are mainly responsible for differences in mean monthly sand temperatures. As such, the coarser and darker sand often used in nourishment projects may exacerbate climate driven increases in surface temperature.	beach erosion; climate change; nesting beach; sand grain characteristics; sand temperature; sea turtle	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	12660	2021.1720	Assisted gene flow using cryopreserved sperm in critically endangered coral	Assisted gene flow (AGF) is a conservation intervention to accelerate species adaptation to climate change by importing genetic diversity into at-risk populations. Corals exemplify both the need for AGF and its technical challenges; corals have declined in abundance, suffered pervasive reproductive failures, and struggled to adapt to climate change, yet mature corals cannot be easily moved for breeding, and coral gametes lose viability within hours. Here, we report the successful demonstration of AGF in corals using cryopreserved sperm that was frozen for 2 to 10 y. We fertilized Acropora palmata eggs from the western Caribbean (Curacao) with cryopreserved sperm from genetically distinct populations in the eastern and central Caribbean (Florida and Puerto Rico, respectively). We then confirmed interpopulation parentage in the Curacao-Florida offspring using 19,696 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. Thus, we provide evidence of reproductive compatibility of a Caribbean coral across a recognized barrier to gene flow. The 6-mo survival of AGF offspring was 42\%, the highest ever achieved in this species, yielding the largest wildlife population ever raised from cryopreserved material. By breeding a critically endangered coral across its range without moving adults, we show that AGF using cryopreservation is a viable conservation tool to increase genetic diversity in threatened marine populations.	assisted gene flow; coral reproduction; cryopreservation; endangered species; acropora palmata	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	28702	2021.3138	Defining the Zostera marina (Eelgrass) Niche from Long-Term Success of Restored and Naturally Colonized Meadows: Implications for Seagrass Restoration	Seagrass restoration can help reverse global meadow loss and restore ecosystem services, including habitat provision for commercial fish and shellfish, carbon sequestration, and improved water quality. However, restoration projects are generally expensive, and site selection remains a challenge due to uncertainty about how environmental variables affect the survival and spread of seedlings. Long-term Zostera marina (eelgrass) success/failure and expansion data from the Virginia Coast Reserve can be used to determine whether the factors that control seedling survival also explain the regional distribution of seagrass meadows. We tracked plant survival and failure within restoration plots and at natural recruitment sites from 2001 to 2015 and used machine learning methods to identify the relative importance of multiple environmental predictors, including water residence time, fetch distance, water temperature, depth, and sediment grain size. Low water residence time was the best predictor of survival, but short fetch length best explained the natural recruit distribution, consistent with hydrodynamic control of seed dispersal. Restoration plot data suggests that the eelgrass fundamental niche covers > 100 km(2) within this system, triple both the current extent and the realized niche predicted by the observed natural spread. Our results corroborate historical records that eelgrass was formerly widespread in areas where it has not spread naturally, likely due to insufficient seed delivery. Additional seeding in these areas would, therefore, increase total seagrass coverage and accelerate recovery. Mapping the total habitable area can help managers maximize the extent of seagrass and other bottom uses, including shellfish aquaculture.	species distribution modeling; environmental niche; seed dispersal; coastal zone management; water residence time	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	4054	2021.554	Coral husbandry for ocean futures: leveraging abiotic factors to increase survivorship, growth, and resilience in juvenile Montipora capitata	Reef restoration via direct outplanting of sexually propagated juvenile corals is a key strategy in preserving coral reef ecosystem function in the face of global and local stressors (e.g. ocean warming). To advance our capacity to scale and maximize the efficiency of restoration initiatives, we examined how abiotic conditions (i.e. larval rearing temperature, substrate condition, light intensity, and flow rate) interact to enhance post-settlement survival and growth of sexually propagated juvenile Montipora capitata. Larvae were reared at 3 temperatures (high: 28.9 degrees C, ambient: 27.2 degrees C, low: 24.5 degrees C) for 72 h during larval development, and were subsequently settled on aragonite plugs conditioned in seawater (1 or 10 wk) and raised in different light and flow regimes. These juvenile corals underwent a natural bleaching event in Kane'ohe Bay, O'ahu, Hawai'i (USA), in summer 2019, allowing us to opportunistically measure bleaching response in addition to survivorship and growth. This study demonstrates how leveraging light and flow can increase the survivorship and growth of juvenile M. capitata. In contrast, larval preconditioning and substrate conditioning had little overall effect on survivorship, growth, or bleaching response. Importantly, there was no optimal combination of abiotic conditions that maximized survival and growth in addition to bleaching tolerances. This study highlights the ability to tailor sexual reproduction for specific restoration goals by addressing knowledge gaps and incorporating practices that could improve resilience in propagated stocks.	montipora capitata; kane'ohe bay; coral husbandry; coral spawning; bleaching	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	61392	2021.6009	The Genetic Component of Seagrass Restoration: What We Know and the Way Forwards	Seagrasses are marine flowering plants providing key ecological services and functions in coasts and estuaries across the globe. Increased environmental changes fueled by human activities are affecting their existence, compromising natural habitats and ecosystems' biodiversity and functioning. In this context, restoration of disturbed seagrass environments has become a worldwide priority to reverse ecosystem degradation and to recover ecosystem functionality and associated services. Despite the proven importance of genetic research to perform successful restoration projects, this aspect has often been overlooked in seagrass restoration. Here, we aimed to provide a comprehensive perspective of genetic aspects related to seagrass restoration. To this end, we first reviewed the importance of studying the genetic diversity and population structure of target seagrass populations; then, we discussed the pros and cons of different approaches used to restore and/or reinforce degraded populations. In general, the collection of genetic information and the development of connectivity maps are critical steps for any seagrass restoration activity. Traditionally, the selection of donor population preferred the use of local gene pools, thought to be the best adapted to current conditions. However, in the face of rapid ocean changes, alternative approaches such as the use of climate-adjusted or admixture genotypes might provide more sustainable options to secure the survival of restored meadows. Also, we discussed different transplantation strategies applied in seagrasses and emphasized the importance of long-term seagrass monitoring in restoration. The newly developed information on epigenetics as well as the application of assisted evolution strategies were also explored. Finally, a view of legal and ethical issues related to national and international restoration management is included, highlighting improvements and potential new directions to integrate with the genetic assessment. We concluded that a good restoration effort should incorporate: (1) a good understanding of the genetic structure of both donors and populations being restored; (2) the analysis of local environmental conditions and disturbances that affect the site to be restored; (3) the analysis of local adaptation constraints influencing the performances of donor populations and native plants; (4) the integration of distribution/connectivity maps with genetic information and environmental factors relative to the target seagrass populations; (5) the planning of long-term monitoring programs to assess the performance of the restored populations. The inclusion of epigenetic knowledge and the development of assisted evolution programs are strongly hoped for the future.	seagrasses; restoration; genetic diversity; donor sites; transplantation; provenance; monitoring	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	61563	2021.6041	Should Hybrids Be Used in Coral Nurseries? A Case Study Comparing Caribbean Acropora spp. and Their Hybrid in the Bahamas	For decades, coral reef ecosystems have been in decline due to environmental stressors such as rising sea temperatures, increased disease prevalence, and other local anthropogenic sources. Considering this decline, coral restoration efforts in the Caribbean have been implemented to promote reef recovery with a focus on the coral genus Acropora. Current methods target the threatened species Acropora cervicornis and A. palmata, but little is known about the restoration potential of their hybrid taxon, A. prolifera. Using interspecific hybrids with higher fitness than one or both parental species has gained traction as a novel restoration technique. For this study, three in situ coral tree nurseries were established around Great Stirrup Cay, The Bahamas, to compare the growth and survival among acroporid taxa. Three 150 mm fragments from six putative genotypes of each acroporid taxa were collected from reefs around New Providence, The Bahamas, and transported to Great Stirrup Cay in June 2018. One fragment from each genotype was transported to each nursery site, cut into three sections (apical, middle, and basal), and suspended from PVC coral trees. Fragment survival was collected monthly for 13 months, and Total Linear Extension (TLE) values were calculated for each fragment monthly for 12 months. Nursery site significantly affected fragment survival, while taxon and fragment section did not. Total fragment mortality was 29.3\% in the first month but ranged from 0 to 5\% for the rest of the study period until July 2019 (32.7\% of remaining fragments died primarily at N1). Overall, A. prolifera growth was significantly greater than the parental species. Taxon, nursery site, and fragment section were identified as important factors affecting TLE. Apical A. prolifera fragment sections at site N3 had the greatest average linear growth at 12 months and had the greatest average growth rate per month. This study highlights the rapid growth rate of hybrid corals and suggests that fragment sections have equivalent survival and growth. Consequently, these results suggest that restoration managers may capitalize on fast growing hybrids for outplanting to degraded reefs and to increase the scale of nursery projects.	acropora; hybrid; coral restoration; coral nursery; caribbean	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	61809	2021.6087	Machine Learning for the Fast and Accurate Assessment of Fitness in Coral Early Life History	As coral reefs continue to degrade globally due to climate change, considerable effort and investment is being put into coral restoration. The production of coral offspring via asexual and sexual reproduction are some of the proposed tools for restoring coral populations and will need to be delivered at scale. Simple, inexpensive, and high-throughput methods are therefore needed for rapid analysis of thousands of coral offspring. Here we develop a machine learning pipeline to rapidly and accurately measure three key indicators of coral juvenile fitness: survival, size, and color. Using machine learning, we classify pixels through an open-source, user-friendly interface to quickly identify and measure coral juveniles on two substrates (field deployed terracotta tiles and experimental, laboratory PVC plastic slides). The method's ease of use and ability to be trained quickly and accurately using small training sets make it suitable for application with images of species of sexually produced corals without existing datasets. Our results show higher accuracy of survival for slides (94.6\% accuracy with five training images) compared to field tiles measured over multiple months (March: 77.5\%, June: 91.3\%, October: 97.9\% accuracy with 100 training images). When using fewer training images, accuracy of area measurements was also higher on slides (7.7\% average size difference) compared to tiles (24.2\% average size difference for October images). The pipeline was 36x faster than manual measurements. The slide images required fewer training images compared to tiles and we provided cut-off guidelines for training for both substrates. These results highlight the importance and power of incorporating high-throughput methods, substrate choice, image quality, and number of training images for measurement accuracy. This study demonstrates the utility of machine learning tools for scalable ecological studies and conservation practices to facilitate rapid management decisions for reef protection.	coral restoration; machine learning; pixel classification; benthic ecology; climate change; coral reproduction; coral settlement; coral fitness	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1
NA	250771	2022.11096	Microhabitat thermal environment controls community structure of macrobenthos on coastal infrastructures	The proliferation of coastal infrastructure in the context of coastal development, urbanization, and global change is inevitably related to the transformation of coastal community structure. For restoration of biodiversity in these human-disturbed coastal ecosystems, it is vital to untangle the community structure and thermal environments, with the consideration of the microhabitat-scale thermal environment variations. In the present study, we measured the species richness, alpha-diversity (i.e. the species composition of each surface of breakwaters), and beta-diversity (i.e. the dissimilarities among macrobenthic communities of different surfaces of breakwater) of macrobenthos on the breakwaters on a tropical shore for understanding the variation of the community structure of macrobenthos; we also monitored the operative temperatures in different surfaces of the breakwaters during the experimental period for investigating the roles of microhabitat thermal environment on the community structure of macrobenthos on the artificial infrastructure. Our results showed that there were higher species richness and abundance in the thermally benign microhabitats. The variations of beta-diversity indicated that the community structure underwent dramatic changes in different microhabitats and seasons. The population dy-namics of thermal-sensitive species (e.g. Patelloida pygmaea, Cellana toreuma, and Siphonaria japonica) largely contributed to the changes in community structure. Redundancy analysis (RDA) results showed that maximum temperature, temperature predictability (i.e. the degree to which a temperature data point in a time series is influenced by its historical values), and heating rate were important thermal characteristics driving community structure on the artificial infrastructure. These results indicate the heterogeneity of thermal environments among different microhabitats is crucial for maintaining the community structure of macrobenthos on the artificial infrastructure and suggest that structural complexity should be considered for biodiversity conservation in the design and construction of coastal infrastructure.	coastal infrastructure; community structure; macrobenthos; microhabitat; thermal variable	2022	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	345280	2022.17449	Magnetic fields generated by the DC cables of offshore wind farms have no effect on spatial distribution or swimming behavior of lesser sandeel larvae (Ammodytes marinus)	In the North Sea, the number and size of offshore wind (OW) turbines, together with the associated network of High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) subsea cables, will increase rapidly over the coming years. HVDC cables produce magnetic fields (MFs) that might have an impact on marine animals that encounter them. One of the fish species that is at risk of exposure to MF associated with OW is the lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus), a keystone species of the North Sea basin. Lesser sandeel could be exposed to MF as larvae, when they drift in proximity of OW turbines. Whether MFs impact the behavior of lesser sandeel larvae, with possible downstream effects on their dispersal and survival, is unknown. We tested the behavior of 56 lesser sandeel larvae, using a setup designed to simulate the scenario of larvae drifting past a DC cable. We exposed the larvae to a MF intensity gradient (150-50 Î¼T) that is within the range of MFs produced by HVDC subsea cables. Exposure to the MF gradient did not affect the spatial distribution of lesser sandeel larvae in a raceway tank 50 cm long, 7 cm wide and 3.5 cm deep. Nor did the MF alter their swimming speed, acceleration or distance moved. These results show that static MF from DC cables would not impact behavior of lesser sandeel larvae during the larval period of their life although it does not exclude the possibility that later life stages could be affected.

NA	61384	2022.6199	Comparing management strategies for conserving communities of climate-threatened species with a stochastic metacommunity model	Many species are shifting their ranges to keep pace with climate change, but habitat fragmentation and limited dispersal could impede these range shifts. In the case of climate-vulnerable foundation species such as tropical reef corals and temperate forest trees, such limitations might put entire communities at risk of extinction. Restoring connectivity through corridors, stepping-stones or enhanced quality of existing patches could prevent the extinction of several species, but dispersal-limited species might not benefit if other species block their dispersal. Alternatively, managers might relocate vulnerable species between habitats through assisted migration, but this is generally a species-by-species approach. To evaluate the relative efficacy of these strategies, we simulated the climate-tracking of species in randomized competitive metacommunities with alternative management interventions. We found that corridors and assisted migration were the most effective strategies at reducing extinction. Assisted migration was especially effective at reducing the extinction likelihood for short-dispersing species, but it often required moving several species repeatedly. Assisted migration was more effective at reducing extinction in environments with higher stochasticity, and corridors were more effective at reducing extinction in environments with lower stochasticity. We discuss the application of these approaches to an array of systems ranging from tropical corals to temperate forests.This article is part of the theme issue `Ecological complexity and the biosphere: the next 30 years'.	connectivity; assisted migration; restoration; climate change; metacommunity	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	61576	2022.6239	Genome-wide analysis of natural and restored eastern oyster populations reveals local adaptation and positive impacts of planting frequency and broodstock number	The release of captive-bred plants and animals has increased worldwide to augment declining species. However, insufficient attention has been given to understanding how neutral and adaptive genetic variation are partitioned within and among proximal natural populations, and the patterns and drivers of gene flow over small spatial scales, which can be important for restoration success. A seascape genomics approach was used to investigate population structure, local adaptation, and the extent to which environmental gradients influence genetic variation among natural and restored populations of Chesapeake Bay eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica. We also investigated the impact of hatchery practices on neutral genetic diversity of restored reefs and quantified the broader genetic impacts of large-scale hatchery-based bivalve restoration. Restored reefs showed similar levels of diversity as natural reefs, and striking relationships were found between planting frequency and broodstock numbers and genetic diversity metrics (effective population size and relatedness), suggesting that hatchery practices can have a major impact on diversity. Despite long-term restoration activities, haphazard historical translocations, and high dispersal potential of larvae that could homogenize allele frequencies among populations, moderate neutral population genetic structure was uncovered. Moreover, environmental factors, namely salinity, pH, and temperature, play a major role in the distribution of neutral and adaptive genetic variation. For marine invertebrates in heterogeneous seascapes, collecting broodstock from large populations experiencing similar environments to candidate sites may provide the most appropriate sources for restoration and ensure population resilience in the face of rapid environmental change. This is one of a few studies to demonstrate empirically that hatchery practices have a major impact on the retention of genetic diversity. Overall, these results contribute to the growing body of evidence for fine-scale genetic structure and local adaptation in broadcast-spawning marine species and provide novel information for the management of an important fisheries resource.	aquaculture; genomics; hatchery; local adaptation; oyster; radseq; restoration	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	62000	2022.6313	A decade of coral biobanking science in Australia-transitioning into applied reef restoration	Active restoration or intervention programs will be required in the future to support the resilience and adaptation of coral reef ecosystems in the face of climate change. Selective propagation of corals ex situ can help conserve keystone species and the ecosystems they underpin; cross-disciplinary research and communication between science and industry are essential to this success. Zoos and aquaria have a long history of managing ex situ breed-for-release programs and have led the establishment of wildlife biobanks (collections of cryopreserved living cells) along with the development of associated reproductive technologies for their application to wildlife conservation. Taronga Conservation Society Australia's CryoDiversity Bank includes cryopreserved coral sperm from the Great Barrier Reef, which represents the largest repository from any reef system around the globe. This paper presents results from an inventory review of the current collection. The review highlighted the skew toward five Acropora species and the necessity to increase the taxonomic diversity of the collection. It also highlighted the need to increase geographic representation, even for the most well represented species. The inventory data will inform Taronga's future research focus and sampling strategy to maximize genetic variation and biodiversity within the biobank and provide a test case for other practitioners implementing biobanking strategies for coral conservation around the world. Through co-investment and collaboration with research partners over the next decade, Taronga will prioritize and resource critical applied research and expand biobanking efforts to assist interventions for reef recovery and restoration.	reef restoration; cryopreservation; biobanking; coral spawning; coral	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	277942	2009.885	Energy storage analysis to increase large ship fuel efficiency	The marine transportation industry is a significant contributor to global emissions of CO2 and other pollutants. Although marine emission standards have become increasingly stringent, increasing fuel efficiency remains the primary objective in terms of further reducing emissions and overall marine energy use. In this paper, a hybrid powertrain is investigated as a means of increasing fuel efficiency for a modern, 100 m class, passenger vessel. The hybrid powertrain includes an Energy Storage System (ESS) based on sodium sulfur (NaS) batteries and commercially available Caterpillar diesel engine-generator sets. The ship's power load profile is based on annual averages for similar vessels. A control strategy and simulation models are developed and implemented in Simulink to analyze the power and energy flows in the hybrid powertrain. The Simulink model is used to compare the base scenario of a ship without energy storage to a hybrid scenario employing a 7.5 MWh NaS battery pack with related control strategy. Annual fuel consumption is the primary measure that is used to assess efficiency. Unlike hybrid powertrains for light-duty surface vehicle transportation, which achieve efficiency gains on the order of 10-20% [8, 9, 10], the hybrid powertrain for a large ship is estimated to lower annual fuel consumption by approximately 2%. The surprisingly small level of fuel savings is explained largely by the granularity of marine power systems, which include multiple generators that can be switched on and off to maximize fuel efficiency.

NA	276921	2010.8033	Hybrid propulsion: True hybrid power for marine propulsion	Ricardo, a consulting engineering firm, is renowned in marine diesel engine circles. The company works closely with several major large engine companies, and such work has increased in both volume and importance as rising fuel costs and tighter emission regulations have forced engine designers as well as vessel operators to look towards ever more radical solutions to raising efficiency without compromising cleanliness. The company is exploring advanced technology in the whole power and propulsion system. Advanced computer modeling and simulation technology permits relevant and in-depth research and development into fuel cell and hybrid technology using various techniques, in some cases executed in real time. The company sees considerable potential in radial turbines, bottoming- or organic-Rankine cycles, and split cycle regenerative engine technologies. Other current activities include research into true hybrid technologies for ship propulsion. Battery-based systems are an obvious choice, similar to those used in hybrid road vehicles, but batteries have proved less than ideal in marine applications. They are heavy, bulky, and costly in terms of initial investment and replacement. Fuel reforming has been a significant part of Ricardo's work. Energy recovery and energy storage technologies also have promising applications in the marine sector. However, as with most technologies, existing hybrid propulsion technology is cost effective up to a point, but becomes a very costly option as higher levels of CO2 reduction are demanded. Thus, Ricardo investigated other energy storage technologies. The most promising of which are hydraulics, ultra-capacitors, and flywheels, which all tend to score more highly than electro-chemical solutions - particularly flywheel.

Deliverance includes the MHI-designed air lubrication system, the DynaWing hybrid Wingmast and mainsail system, and Solbian marine solar panels. With a range of possible power sources, including wind, solar power, LNG and, diesel, Deliverance can sail at around l5 knots on around 20 Mw of power. With a full array of sails with Wingsail emulated efficiency, to a gradual reduction of all sails culminating in Wingmast reefing to sustainable and renewable sun power sources, DynaWing sails can deliver between 4 and 8 Mw of power while the Solbian Solar Panels can offer up to 4 Mw output. As a major Certified Carbon Offset Project, the carbon offset or reduction in greenhouse gas emissions achieved by Deliverance is 11 0,000 ton/yr of CO 2. Capital costs for Deliverance run at around 10-15% higher than a conventional vessel which operates with a 30 Mw output, however, MHI?s Bubble Hull design improves efficiency, significantly reducing the amount of power needed. Deliverance is a cost effective workhorse sized vessel which would normally cost around $180 million, with savings of up to 75% in fuel consumption and pollution costs is significantly reduced.

In this paper, a combined solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and steam turbine fuelled by natural gas is proposed as an attractive option to limit the environmental impact of the marine sector. The analyzed variant of the combined cycle includes a SOFC operated with natural gas fuel and a steam turbine with a single-pressure waste heat boiler. The calculations were performed for two types of tubular and planar SOFCs, each with an output power of 18 MW. This paper includes a detailed energy analysis of the combined system. Mass and energy balances are performed not only for the whole plant but also for each component in order to evaluate the thermal efficiency of the combined cycle. In addition, the effects of using natural gas as a fuel on the fuel cell voltage and performance are investigated. It has been found that a high overall efficiency approaching 60% may be achieved with an optimum configuration using the SOFC system. The hybrid system would also reduce emissions, fuel consumption, and improve the total system efficiency. Â© 2013 Harbin Engineering University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

NA	271974	2013.11204	Environmental regulations spark power savings, reliability and safety	Increasingly stringent environmental policies are causing sea vessels to look at ways to adapt to reduce emissions. Thankfully, as marine operators explore new ship designs and technologies for achieving cleaner operations, they are also realizing other benefits from hybrid drives and energy storage solutions-including improved safety, reliability and cost savings. The technology has undergone significant advances across a wide range of marine applications over the past several years. The modernization of the ship would generate significant fuel savings, but the overall advantages would stem from energy storage. The ability to use energy reserves generated from the new technology would enable modernization with advanced, power-hungry weapons systems. The US Navy sources indicate hybrid-electric drives will increase vessel mission efficiency by allowing increased time at posts. Adding propulsion-derived ship service, or PDSS, to the HED increases the gains to 12 to 15 percent.	electric drives;  energy storage;  environmental regulations;  fuel economy;  marine applications;  ship propulsion, cost saving;  energy reserves;  environmental policy;  fuel savings;  hybrid drive;  power savings;  reliability and safeties;  weapons systems, naval vessels	2013	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The hybrid system would also reduce emissions, fuel consumption, and improve the total system efficiency.	combustion;  environmental impact;  fossil fuel power plants;  fuel cell power plants;  fuel cells;  gas fuel analysis;  gas turbine power plants;  gas turbines;  gases;  hybrid systems;  marine applications;  marine power plants;  natural gas;  thermoanalysis;  thermodynamic properties;  thermodynamics;  waste heat, different operating conditions;  electric power demands;  heat recovery systems;  individual components;  marine gas turbines;  mass and energy balance;  optimum configurations;  thermo dynamic analysis, solid oxide fuel cells (sofc)	2013	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	270033	2014.970	Thermal power plant efficiency enhancement with Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion	In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, coastal thermal power plants would gain further opposition due to their heat rejection distressing the local ecosystem. Therefore, these plants need to enhance their thermal efficiency while reducing their environmental offense. In this study, a hybrid plant based on the principle of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion was coupled to a 740 MW coal-fired power plant project located at latitude 28 S where the surface to deepwater temperature difference would not suffice for regular OTEC plants. This paper presents the thermodynamical model to assess the overall efficiency gained by adopting an ammonia Rankine cycle plus a desalinating unit, heated by the power plant condenser discharge and refrigerated by cold deep seawater. The simulation allowed us to optimize a system that would finally enhance the plant power output by 25-37 MW, depending on the season, without added emissions while reducing dramatically the water temperature at discharge and also desalinating up to 5.8 million tons per year. The supplemental equipment was sized and the specific emissions reduction was estimated. We believe that this approach would improve the acceptability of thermal and nuclear power plant projects regardless of the plant location. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

NA	265634	2015.12905	Reducing cost and environmental impacts through hybrid power options	Power solutions for seagoing vessels have typically been designed to enable operation at maximum economic speeds based on hydrodynamic considerations, and to ensure that vessels have the necessary power to be seaworthy and maneuverable in heavy weather and in high sea states. Historically, fuel costs have been low compared to fixed and other variable costs, but more recently, rising fuel prices and environmental concerns have made it more attractive to reduce fuel consumption through lower steaming speeds. Since speed reduction drastically reduces power requirements, it has become common to operate at 15 to 50% of the installed power in calm to moderate sea conditions. When engines operate at low power, fuel consumption per kWh produced power increases slightly, while the emissions of exhaust gases increase rapidly due to incomplete combustion. This study investigates flexible hybrid power solutions, i.e. power take out (PTO), power take in (PTI) and batteries in combination with internal combustion engines. The focus is on the full operational range from being idle at berth to the peak power needed in critical situations in high sea states. Our results indicate that hybrid solutions are cost-competitive with traditional engine setups. They also reduce the environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions and cost effectively satisfies IMOâ€™s energy efficiency requirements (EEDI).

NA	263231	2016.14180	Green technologies for offshore industry	Environmental technological innovations driven by the evolving regulatory landscape have the potential to provide performance solutions for the next generation of offshore vessels. Future historians may look back at the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, Annex VI (MARPOL) requirements as one of the most important pieces of maritime legislation passed. It sets in motion a series of requirements that change the way vessels are designed and operated. For all practical purposes, the offshore industry may be revolutionized by the confluence of Annex VI requirements which limit the amount of sulfur in fuel oil, limit the amount of nitrogen oxides emitted from the engine combustion process, and reduce CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. The economics of alternative fuels such as LNG and the imperatives of operating in Emission Control Areas (ECA) are driving innovative vessel designs. Offshore vessel operators of the world can greatly benefit by adopting green technologies such as renewable energy, alternative fuels, hybrid propulsion and power generation plants, and advanced environmental systems. This paper will outline a number of emission pollutant driven and energy efficiency driven green ship technologies currently being adopted in offshore vessel design, and considers the opportunities this presents for future designs.

NA	328281	2017.13607	Stand-alone island daily power management using a tidal turbine farm and an ocean compressed air energy storage system	Due to the high predictability and the high energy density, marine tidal resource has become an area of increasing interest with various academic and industrial projects around the world. In fact, several Marine Current Turbine (MCT) farm projects with multi-megawatt capacity are planned to be installed in the coming years. In this paper, a MCT farm is supposed to be the main energy supply for a stand-alone island. To compensate the MCT farm power variation relating to the tidal phenomenon, an Ocean Compressed Air Energy Storage (OCAES) system is considered to achieve the island power management. The novelty in this work is that conventional Diesel Generators (DGs) would only serve as a backup supply while the main island power supply will be fulfilled by the proposed hybrid MCT/OCAES system. A simplified OCAES model is built-up in this paper with cycle efficiency about 60.6%. Simulations under different working conditions are carried out to validate the feasibility of the hybrid power system. The obtained results show that the proposed system power management can greatly help to decrease DG fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emission.

NA	259493	2017.1440	Hydraulic design and performance analysis on a small pump-turbine system for ocean renewable energy storage system	Korea has a myriad of islands in the south western coast that extensively rely on diesel generators for power production, which increase cost and environment pollution. The small hydro pump-turbine system for ocean renewable energy storage system is a kind of hybrid system that can reduce the usage of diesel generators and help to contribute to the environment in a positive manner by helping to reduce carbon emissions. The study focuses on initial hydraulic design and numerical analysis of a 30 kW-class pump-turbine system for energy independent islands in South Korea. The purpose of the study is to propose an ocean renewable energy storage system using a small pump-turbine system working with seawater. A 30 kW-class pump-turbine does not require a large head; approximately 30 m is sufficient for the design and application. Several other renewable energy systems like wind turbines, tidal turbines, wave energy converters and solar energy could be used to make a hybrid system with pump-turbine. The initial design achieved more than 85 % efficiency in both pump and turbine modes. However, further optimizations of the impeller blade shape and number of guide vane and stay vanes could improve the overall efficiency of the system.

NA	260472	2017.15110	Weighted average representation for estimation of fuel saving and emissions reduction in hybrid marine power plants with strategic loading	Recent developments in marine power systems, battery technology and modification to class rules and regulations increased the opportunities to improve the efficiency and reduce the emissions in energy production by marine power plants. In this paper, an analysis of marine hybrid power plants is developed, focusing on understanding the operations with energy storage devices. It reviews the strategic loading methodology as well as proposes a steady state weighted average representation of the results. This will lead to a much more intuitive interpretation of the results, thus, an estimation of the fuel saving potential for hybrid vessels with strategic loading can be developed by simply analyzing the generator set fuel oil consumption curves. The need to develop a simple model to estimate the average emissions and fuel consumption is due to the fact that it can be further used to create optimization algorithms, aid in the hybrid power plant design and operation, or in future research in hybrid power plants. Very few studies have been conducted on understanding how the generator-sets and energy storage devices interact, and the reason why it reduces emissions and fuel consumption. This steady state approach takes into account the energy storage device maximum capacity, charge/discharge rate, and the energy storage device efficiency. Dynamical effects like the generator speed fluctuation and engine load ramping are disregarded. Through this geometrical approach, it becomes clear that for most engines, the biggest opportunity for fuel savings and emissions reduction is when at least one generator is disconnected from the grid, as shown on the cases studied, where the fuel savings and NOx emission reduction reached values of up to 15%. In the case of generator-set disconnection, the energy storage devices also serve as a spinning reserve.

NA	260626	2017.15246	Design and evaluation of LNG-hydrogen hybrid propulsion system for LNG carrier	Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) in International Maritime Organization (IMO) is regulating the CO2 emission from vessels by an established index called the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). The EEDI is applied to every ocean-going vessel and ratified to be stringent with respect to time; the CO2 emission should be reduced by 30 % in 2022 (Phase 3) and by 40 % in 2025 (Phase 4) from the emission level of 2013. Although the LNG-fuelled propulsion system has been developed to reduce the green-house gas emission, it hardly meet the regulation in Phase 4, and consequently some fuel without green-house gas emission should be combined with LNG. This study proposes the LNG-hydrogen hybrid system of a LNG carrier with 154K, 210K, and 267K cargo capacity and discusses some issues including the relative ratio of hydrogen with respect to LNG, the size of hydrogen fuel tanks, and operating complexities to satisfy the step-by-step regulations. An appropriate ratio of hydrogen fuel to satisfy the environmental regulation is estimated to more than 12% and 27% for Phase 4 and 5 respectively. The tank size of liquid hydrogen for the ship is estimated 1,300 âˆ¼ 3,300 m3, and the power of a fuel cell is required to be 4.9 âˆ¼ 11.8 MW. Optimising the hybrid propulsion system considering the spatial, operational, and economic feasibility for the hybrid propulsion system is identified as a future challenge.

NA	144096	2017.9991	Optimizing Fuel Savings and Power System Reliability for All-Electric Hybrid Vessels using Model Predictive Control	Increasingly stringent regulations on emission control and energy efficiency operations drives the maritime industry towards hybrid solutions incorporating energy storage and other alternative energy sources into marine power systems. In particular, commercial all-electric hybrid vessels with dynamic operations such as harbor tugs often face significant challenges in power management control to maximize fuel savings, in addition to ensuring power system reliability. An intelligent power management control strategy plays an important role in effectively managing the multiple energy sources and their constraints to achieve desired control objectives. Hence, in this paper, Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is proposed to address these challenges. The propose strategy shows comparative performance in terms of fuel savings when compared to the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS), with added advantage of improving power system reliability.

NA	201256	2018.13246	Assessment of the Potential of Energy Extracted from Waves and Wind to Supply Offshore Oil Platforms Operating in the Gulf of Mexico	Offshore oil platforms operate with independent electrical systems using gas turbines to generate their own electricity. However, gas turbines operate very inefficiently under the variable offshore conditions, increasing fuel costs and air pollutant emissions. This paper focused on investigating the feasibility of implementing a hybrid electricity supply system for offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, both for the United States and Mexico Exclusive Economic Zones. Geographic Information Systems methodologies were used to analyze the data from various sources. Three different scenarios were studied, including wind power only, wave power only, and wind and wave power combined. The results showed that all the offshore locations were within accepted feasible distance to the coast for connecting to the onshore grid. Most of the locations had acceptable power levels of either wind or wave energy while the combination of both resources can improve the overall energy harvesting efficiency and reduce the variability in a significant number of locations. The proposed methodology can be applied for specific locations with finer spatial and time resolution, which will allow stakeholders to improve the decision making process, generate important savings on the normal operation, reduce pollution, and potentially increase income by selling surplus energy from renewable sources.	wind power; wave power; offshore oil platforms; gulf of mexico; geographic information systems; wavewatch iii	2018	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	322379	2018.17851	Assessment of wind energy in the United States Gulf of Mexico area as power supply for offshore oil platforms	Offshore oil and gas platforms operate under independent power systems, using Gas Turbines (GT) to generate the required electricity. However, the nature of offshore operations causes GT to operate at 30% efficiency, which is low when compared with overall normal average efficiency of 55% for combined cycle gas power plants. This increases fuel consumption and the emission of air pollutants, among other disadvantages. The issue can be ameliorated by integrating the system to the onshore grid and to a wind energy system, supplemented with an energy storage component. This research developed a new methodology to evaluate the integration of offshore oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico to a hybrid electrical system of wind energy, battery components and interconnection to onshore electrical grid to improve its performance. The objectives included improving overall electric generation efficiency, decreasing both fuel consumption and air pollutant emissions and potentially increasing income by selling surplus energy from renewable sources. Geographic Information System (GIS) and Big Data analyses were applied to data generated by the NOAA's Wave Watch III to calculate offshore wind energy for assessment for use on more than 4,000 offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico from data provided by the USGS CMGP, while simultaneously evaluating interconnection feasibility with the onshore grid. The results for the distance analysis were favorable, considering the criteria expressed by previous research. Wind energy assessment revealed a seasonal behavior, with each month showing distinctive power outputs. High power levels were obtained from November to April while overall low power levels were observed from June to August. However most of the 4,000 platforms produced wind power levels above the commercial threshold and an important percentage of the locations produced power levels above capacity factor thresholds that made them exceptionally productive. Overall results indicated that all the locations were within accepted feasible distance from the coast and most of them had acceptable wind energy levels. The proposed GIS methodology can be applied for individual projects, with specific spatial and time resolution. The results of these studies can assist stakeholders on decision making processes of offshore projects.

NA	253204	2019.16995	Fuel Saving with a Hybrid Power System for an Electric Ferry	Fuel efficiency improvements and integration of low or zero emission sources into shipboard power systems have recently become a global trend in the maritime industry. In this context, hybrid ship power system architectures with diesel-electric generators and battery energy storage systems have drawn attention as an attractive solution to increase fuel efficiency and thereby reduce emissions. In this arrangement, the battery energy storage system is used as a buffer to decouple the load dynamics and thereby allow the engine to operate at its optimal operating range. The aim of this study is to assess the fuel saving that can be achieved with this arrangement in an electric ferry. Load profile of an actual ferry, operating between two terminals, is used to estimate the fuel-saving. Results of this study showed that 4.65 L of fuel can be saved in a round-trip by avoiding low efficiency operating regions of the diesel engine.

NA	60518	2019.4859	Affordable CO2 negative emission through hydrogen from biomass, ocean liming, and CO2 storage	A new process to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, by combining commercial industrial technologies with ocean liming and CO2 storage, is presented. The process aims to overcome the limiting factors of other negative emission technologies (cost and energy requirements, potential competition for land and freshwater) while simultaneously addressing the problem of ocean acidification. The overall proposed process is based on the following: (a) a gasifier where the biomass is converted to syngas; (b) a thermal steam reformer working at high temperature where the hydrocarbons and tar oils are converted to hydrogen (H-2) and carbon monoxide (CO); (c) a kiln to produce Ca(OH)(2) (slaked lime) from limestone by using the enthalpy of the hot syngas; (d) the spreading, by means of vessels, of the slaked lime into the seawater to achieve ocean liming; (e) the delivery of syngas to a water gas shift reactor producing CO2 and H-2 that are then separated; (f) the final storage of all CO2 produced in the process; (g) the use of H-2, being the valuable by-product of the whole process, for decarbonized energy production as well as for ammonia synthesis, offsetting part of the production cost, thus generating ``low-cost{''} negative emissions. The mass and energy balances show that the total atmospheric CO2 removed by the process is 2.6 ton per ton of biomass used. By adding an estimated 0.43 ton avoided-thanks to the use of produced H-2-the overall CO2 benefit of the process increases to 3.0 ton per ton of biomass. A preliminary cost analysis resulted in an average levelized cost of 98 \$ per ton of CO2 removed; when considering the revenues from the produced energy, the cost falls to 64 \$/tCO(2). The higher efficiency in carbon removal obtained allows to reduce the amount of biomass required by BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) to achieve negative emissions, and thanks to the valuable H-2 produced it lowers the costs of CO2 removal from the atmosphere.	negative emissions; ocean alkalinization; carbon dioxide removal; gasification; calcination; carbon storage	2019	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The hybrid concept integrates offshore wind power with gas turbines and a H-2 energy storage solution based on proton exchange membrane fuel cells and electrolysers. The objectives are: 1) improve the environmental performance of offshore installations by maximizing the exploitation of offshore wind and partially decarbonizing the gas turbines by co-feeding H-2; 2) minimize the negative effects that wind power variability has on the electrical grid frequency stability. This study presents a first assessment of the HES-OFF concept performance using an offshore platform in the North Sea as case study. The results show that the HES-OFF concept: 1) cuts CO2 emissions up to 40 \% when compared to the reference case but requires large H-2 storage capacity to fully exploit wind power throughout the year; 2) allows higher wind power penetration without infringing on the grid frequency requirements.	offshore energy; hybrid system; energy storage; system design; grid stability	2020	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	304120	2020.19583	FUEL CELLS IN DEEP-SEA SHIPPING: CHALLENGING PATH AHEAD	As regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions take effect step by step, the introduction of fuel cells to vessels is inevitable. In response to this, Samsung Heavy Industries' (SHI) Outfitting Team is working with New York-listed Bloom Energy to develop an Aframax tanker design powered by fuel cells running on natural gas. Fuel cells are capable of providing a zero-emission source of energy for deep-sea ships. However, until such marine fuel cell installations are optimized, power density, and therefore real estate required on board, will be a challenge compared to internal combustion engines. Two types are considered potentially most suitable for marine applications. First, low temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells provide high power density comparable with internal combustion engines. Solid oxide fuel cells, meanwhile, operate at high temperatures, creating opportunities for waste heat recovery, as well as the potential for more durable generators, greater fuel flexibility, and very high combined cycle efficiencies. The adoption of fuel cells will increase, initially for distributed power, then for integration with larger systems to meet continuous power demands, and ultimately for propulsion. Following the 2018 closure of the 15-yr FellowShip project exploring the use of batteries, hybrids, and fuel cell technologies with pilot installations on board the offshore supply vessel, Viking Lady, WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ is working again with Norway's Eidesvik Offshore, state oil company Equinor and classification society DNV GL to test fuel cells on board Eidesvik's supply vessel, Viking Energy. The LNG-powered vessel is to be modified to enable it to cover large distances fueled by carbon-free ammonia fuel cells.

NA	304898	2020.19996	Electroâ€technologies for energy efficiency improvement and low carbon emission in maritime transport	The global share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships is on the rise which will become a significant portion leading to climate changes and other environmental issues unless reduction measures are taken. Therefore, the International Maritime Origination (IMO) and other regulatory bodies have set limits for emissions and defined emission controlled areas. As a result, alternative fuel such as Hydrogen and liquefied natural gas (LNG) that are low in greenhouse gas emission and competitive in cost are gradually being entered into the shipping industry. However, these alternative fuel technologies are still in the developing stage and the necessary infrastructure is not fully developed yet. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that majority of the ships continue to burn fossil fuel for the foreseeable future. A promising and viable solution for reducing the emissions is to reduce the fuel consumption through efficiency improvement. In this context, electro-technologies are shown to be capable of playing a vital role in improving fuel efficiency and thereby reducing emissions. The aim of this paper is to present a review on recent advancements of electro-technologies that help improve fuel efficiency of ships. A hybrid electric ship propulsion system is discussed as an example to show the potential of electro-technologies in improving the fuel efficiency.

NA	300993	2020.3088	Optimal Design of a Hybrid Energy System for the Supply of Clean and Stable Energy to Offshore Installations	This paper presents an innovative hybrid energy system for stable power and heat supply in offshore oil and gas installations. The proposed concept integrates offshore wind power, onsite gas turbines and an energy storage system based on fuel cell and electrolyzer stacks. It is expected to be an effective option to decarbonize the offshore petroleum sector as it allows a more extensive exploitation of the offshore wind resource by means of energy storage. To ascertain its potential, an integrated model was developed. The integrated model allows to simulate the process and electric grid performances. The inclusion of both domains provides a comprehensive picture of a given design operational performance. The feasibility of the proposed concept was first investigated through a parametric analysis where an understanding of its potential and limitations was gained. A rigorous optimization was then implemented to identify the designs resulting in the best performances and ultimately to obtain a comprehensive picture of the suitability of the concept. It is shown that a well-designed system can reduce carbon emissions compared, not only to a standard concept based on gas turbines (almost 1,300Â kt less CO2 emissions, making up for a relative 36% reduction), but also to the integration of a wind farm alone (more than 70Â kt less CO2 emissions, making up for a relative 3% reduction, but complying with grid dynamics requirements). Moreover, the energy storage system brings benefits to the electric grid stability and allows the integration of large wind power capacity without overpassing the 2% maximum frequency variation (as it is the case without energy storage). Not least, the optimization showed that the definition of an optimal design is a complex task, with little margin to further gains in terms of carbon emissions, likely due to technological limitations.

NA	300618	2021.21509	Hybrid Offshore Power Generation	Amid 2020 challenging business environments due to COVID-19 pandemic and strong global push towards transition to cleaner energy, PETRONAS has declared its' aspiration to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. PETRONAS sustainability journey has begun for more than two decades and with strong management support towards renewable and as part of PETRONAS's technology agenda, its' research arm, PETRONAS Research Sdn. Bhd. (PRSB) has been working on ways to use renewable energy sources for offshore oil and gas platforms in Malaysia. Oil and Gas industry has long relied on turbine generators for offshore power generation. These turbo-fired machineries are operating as microgrid with existing power management system (PMS) as microgrid controllers. They normally use either gas or diesel as fuel gas to ensure reliable power generation where high maintence cost is expected to operate these generators. Also, they have low energy efficiency and hence, usually oversized to ensure meeting the demand reliably. Typically, the power generation load is being taken by two units of turbine generators with another unit as spare. This has resulted in high operational expenditure (OPEX) and contributes to high levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for offshore power generation for such conventional system. LCOE is the yardstick for power generation technology, and it measures discounted lifecycle cost consisting of both capital expenditure (CAPEX) and OPEX, divided by discounted lifecycle of annual energy production [2], [4], [5]. Also, these turbine generators operating at platforms that have gas evacuation pipelines will use up precious fuel gas which can otherwise be sold. This will have impact on the total sales gas revenue. Not withstanding, the burning of the fuel gas will result in the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and hence is exposed to carbon tax. To mitigate this issue, PRSB has developed an offshore hybrid power generation concept to leverage and optimize wind turbine system for offshore power generation in weak wind area such as Malaysia. In this concept, one gas turbine generator is replaced by an offshore wind turbine adapted to low wind speed region. This will lower the maintenance cost and carbon exposure. Also, the fuel gas will be diverted to sales gas. This in turn will improve the economics of the renewable solution thereby making offshore renewable power generation feasible for oil and gas platforms. Forward thinking efforts include pushing the limits of harnessing wind energy in weak wind area such as Malaysia. In here, considerations of a total solution include not only the type of wind turbine generator that can be adapted to weak wind area and having the lowest maintenance requirements as possible, but also looking into cutting edge foundation technologies. The LCOE is expected to be lower than conventional power generation. To ensure optimized hybrid concept, careful selection and adaptations of wind turbine system and its' substructure are required to achieve a cost-effective solution [3], [2]. Conceptual engineering and front-end engineering design were conducted which resulted in the development of the hybrid offshore power generation system. In this paper, the hybrid concept will be shown, the considerations for selection of a suitable wind turbine will be shared and the decisions leading the to the selection and optimization of the foundation type, either fixed bottom or floating are elaborated.

NA	300730	2021.21596	An alternative and hybrid propulsion for merchant ships: current state and perspective	The maritime industry is becoming increasingly aware of the global environmental impact of ships and is being forced, by international legislation, to gradually reduce its emissions. International Maritime Organization conventions and energy efficiency standards set challenges to shipping sector, to ship owners and ship designers, and to offer propulsion concepts that will effectively reduce or completely eliminate emission rates and increase energy efficiency with acceptable technological costs and adjustment time. New concepts include environmental-friendly fuels in existing propulsion architecture, hybrid propulsion, and all-electric propulsion architecture with the possible application of renewable energy sources, which are reviewed in this paper. Each concept has advantages and disadvantages regarding adjustment time, implementation cost and energy storage system capacity. One of the main disadvantages for complete replacement of conventional propulsion systems is the limited energy storage capacity of existing storage devices, which would decrease the operational ability of the shipping sector as a cheap transportation solution on the global market. Such problems and unsolved environmental issues regarding the production and recycling of energy storage devices are highlighted in this paper and must be further developed. The main motivation for the paper's work is to offer a detailed review of possible solutions for ship propulsion and to offer direction for further research. This is obtained by applying a literature review method to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each proposed solution. The results are discussed in the last section of the paper with the final conclusion that the internal combustion engines will not be completely replaced in the shipping sector in terms of the next few decades but will be able to use environmental-friendly fuels or fuels without a global carbon footprint. This conclusion is the result of analyzing especially large ocean-going vessels with very strong internal combustion engines. Such high power and energy demand are not very easy to be replaced with alternative energy sources or with all-electric ship solution without decreasing all other advantages of merchant shipping sector. Forecasts of ambitious decarbonization scenarios predict wide usage of carbon-neutral fuels in the late 2030s or mid-2040s and Green House Gases reduction (in the range between 50% and 100%) in 2050, which can be obtained by using enviromental-friendly fuels in existing infrastructure. It is still hard to identify which carbon-neutral fuel will be dominant, but e-ammonia, blue ammonia, bio-methanol, and hydrogen are the most promising carbon-neutral fuels in the decarbonization path.

NA	296734	2021.236	Techno-energy-economic assessment of a high capacity offshore wind-pumped-storage hybrid power system for regional power system	Developing offshore wind powerâ€”one of the most promising renewable energy sourcesâ€”is considered to be an effective measure by China to promote energy transformation and achieve carbon neutrality. The integration of offshore wind with energy storage facilities can improve wind energy opportunities and mitigate the disharmony between energy generation and supply. This study develops a mathematical model to optimise a high capacity offshore wind-pumped-storage hybrid power system with Non-dominant Sorting Genetic Algorithm with Elite Strategy (NSGA-â…¡). We optimised various objects and compared the results. The results showed that the positive effects of increased electricity sales revenue could not always balance the negative effects of increased investments after configuring energy storage. Moreover, the simulation of the pumping state, discharging state, and state of charge (SOC) examined the system performance. The annual energy distribution analysed quantitively the reservoirs utilisation frequency and energy utilisation efficiency, which revealed the effect of design variables on pumping and discharging operation. Additionally, the effects of system stability constraints and load demand levels on the economic benefits, system performance, and CO2 emission reduction were compared and analysed. The adaptability of the optimal configurations to high load demand was tested. Finally, the sensitivity analysis provided clear guidance on external financial parameters for subsidy backslope.

NA	298097	2021.2523	Comparative study of a hybrid research vessel utilizing batteries or hydrogen fuel cells	The Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) current coastal/local research vessel, the R/V Robert Gordon Sproul, is nearing the end of its service life and will soon require replacement. This study compares three potential variants for an R/V Sproul replacement vessel (SRV): a Baseline SRV consisting of a traditional diesel-electric powertrain, a Battery Hybrid SRV (battery/diesel-electric) and a Hydrogen Hybrid SRV (hydrogen fuel cell/diesel-electric). All three variants meet the science mission requirements of the SRV but with varying levels of zero-emission runtime, energy efficiency and emissions. The Battery Hybrid SRV can provide 2.5 h of zero emissions (battery only) operation, but could not complete any of the identified SRV science missions without also engaging the diesel generators. In contrast, the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV can provide 23.4 h of zero emission (hydrogen only) runtime, and can complete 74% of the SRV science missions solely with zero-emission operation. The superior performance of the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV is attributable to the higher volumetric energy storage density of the LH2/fuel cell combination. The capital costs of these vessels are estimated to be: âˆ¼ $21.4 M for the diesel-electric Baseline SRV, âˆ¼ $26.0 M for the Battery Hybrid SRV vessel and âˆ¼ $34.4 M for the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV. The â€œwell-to-wavesâ€ (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant emissions were estimated using various sourcings for the diesel fuel, electricity and hydrogen fuel. The lowest emission levels are achieved with the Hydrogen Hybrid variant using 100% renewable hydrogen. The annual WTW GHG emissions from the Hydrogen Hybrid using renewable LH2 in combination with fossil diesel in the hybrid arrangement yields a 26.7% GHG emissions reduction from the Baseline vessel using fossil-derived diesel fuel. The Battery Hybrid vessel with 100% renewable electricity combined with diesel fuel provides a 6.9% reduction in GHG emissions. Similar results are seen for the criteria pollutant emissions. The hybrid vessels are also compared with regard to operational safety. The study reveals that hydrogen fuel-cell technology provides an effective hybrid supplement to diesel power for a coastal/local research vessel.

NA	27255	2021.3007	Hybrid Electric Solutions for Marine Applications	The transition to a sustainable economy is one of the major undertakings in human history. Meeting the International Maritime Organization's goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions from ships by 2050 is a critical step toward sustainability. It will require a comprehensive and proactive response from the maritime community. Shipping is well positioned to take concrete action by choosing to implement technologies that provide reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions. Technical solutions to improve energy efficiency and to decarbonize shipping are increasingly leading towards electrification in marine applications. Electric propulsion enables to optimize the power production under varying load profiles, and simplifies integration of energy storage systems and alternative power sources. In marine power distribution, DC grid solutions are gaining popularity and increasing the content of power electronics in shipboard power systems. Strict regulations and requirements to cut emissions are accelerating investments in renewable hydrogen and electrofuels. Accordingly, the marine industry is undergoing a rapid transition from fossil to alternative low-carbon fuels. This will introduce fuel cells as a credible alternative to internal combustion engines, and further increasing the share of electric power distribution semiconductorbased power conversion.

NA	300719	2021.3634	Renewable wave energy potential for the sustainable offshore oil platforms in South China Sea	The Jacket platform needs gas and diesel to run its turbines, and in the end, they produce catastrophic emissions annually. The environmental concerns regarding these platforms have forced us to utilize an alternative source of energy that is sustainable and clean. In this study 51 locations, are of interest where oil and gas activities are in progress at present in the shape of a jacket platform or pipelines. The significant wave height and wave period scatter diagram data are collected from the platforms in the South China Sea. The linear wave theory is used to find the wave power. The given time period is converted into an equivalent time period first before wave energy is determined. The study shows that location no. 20 is the ideal location to deploy the wave energy converter Pelamis P2 with a potential mean wave power of 6.61 kW/m A single unit of Pelamis P2 can produce on an average electricity output of 91.37 kW/m including, the losses and machine efficiencies, whereas a wave farm can generate an average output of 62 GWh/yr. The electricity supply of 70.3 % of the minimum and 14.1 % of the maximum energy demand, while using only wave energy converter. If hybrid wind and wave energy system is used, then energy production will increase. The results show that the wave farm could also reduce the use of natural gas up to 17.6E06 m3/year, avoiding the emission of 12000 tonnes of CO and 54000 tonnes of NOx annually, and can save up to RM 20 billion annually with the reduction of natural gas emissions.

NA	58101	2021.5704	Sizing and Control of a Hybrid Ship Propulsion System Using Multi-Objective Double-Layer Optimization	Ship hybridization has received some interests recently in order to achieve the emission target by 2050. However, designing and optimizing a hybrid propulsion system is a complicated problem. Sizing components and optimizing energy management control are coupled with each other. This paper applies a nested double-layer optimization architecture to optimize the sizing and energy management of a hybrid offshore support vessel. Three different power sources, namely diesel engines, batteries and fuel cells, are considered which increases the complexity of the optimization problem. The optimal sizing of the components and their corresponding energy management strategies are illustrated. The effects of the operational profiles and the emission reduction targets on the hybridization design are studied for this particular type of vessel. The results prove that a small emission reduction target of about 10\% can be achieved by improving the diesel engine efficiency using the batteries only while the achievement of a larger emission reduction target mainly depends on the amount of the hydrogen and/or on-shore charging electricity consumed. Some design guidelines for hybridization are derived for this particular ship which could be also valid for other vessels with similar operational profiles.	propulsion; marine vehicles; optimization; fuel cells; batteries; hydrogen; energy management; hybrid; offshore support vessel; sizing; control; energy management	2021	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	14715	2022.2014	Navigating within the Safe Operating Space with Carbon Capture On-Board	Despite the global pandemic that recently affected human and cargo transportation, the emissions of the maritime sector are projected to keep growing steadily. The International Maritime Organization focused on boosting the fleets' efficiency to improve their environmental performance, while more sustainable fuels are currently under investigation. Here, we assess the economic, technical, and environmental feasibility of an interim solution for low-carbon shipping using state-of-the-art CO2 capture technology, namely, chemical absorption, on-board cargo ships. We compute the carbon footprint of this alternative and perform an absolute sustainability study based on seven planetary boundaries. Our results show that the capture on-board scenario can achieve 94\% efficiency on the net CO2 emissions at 85 \$/tCO2 while substantially reducing impacts on core planetary boundaries (relative to the business as usual) and outperforming a direct air capture scenario in global warming and all planetary boundaries, except for the nitrogen flow. Hence, capture on -board seems an appealing solution to decarbonize shipping in the short term while alternative carbon-free fuels and related infrastructure are developed and deployed.	container ship; lining industry; maritime emissions; co2 capture; direct air capture; global warming; planetary boundaries	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	252873	2022.20568	Design and Simulation of Ammonia-Fueled SOFC-ICE Hybrid Power System for Ship Application	Increasingly stringent emission limits and carbon reduction needs of the shipping industry have forced shipowners and builders to look for alternative fuels and related power technology. Using ammonia to fuel solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems is one of the most efficient and environment-friendly technology options for the marine power. Considering the efficient utilization of exhaust gas and the effective integration of hybrid system, the combination of SOFC and other power technologies can achieve higher efficiency. In view of the current promotion of low-carbon/zero carbon fuel in the maritime industry and the integration of efficient and stable complementary SOFC and internal combustion engine (ICE) hybrid, it will be applied on ships in the future. Therefore, this paper designed an ammonia-fueled SOFC-ICE hybrid system for all-electric ship application. Based on MATLAB/SIMULINL, the steady-state electrochemical model of SOFC and the look-up table model of ICE about load were established. It is found that the electric efficiency of the ammonia ICE can reach about 30%. Based on a typical oil tanker, the ammonia-fueled SOFC-ICE hybrid power system achieves an electrical efficiency of 46.6% when the installed power density of the ammonia-fueled SOFC is 0.3 W/cm2 and the SOFC/ICE power ratio is 70-30.

NA	285431	2022.2080	Comparative study of energy efficiency and cost optimization in low-emission marine power systems with alternative fuels	Marine hybrid power systems fed by so-called "alternative fuels"are key enablers to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ship propulsion and reaching international targets, particularly for large vessels. In this paper, a few scenarios of green propulsion are studied based on low-emission energy carriers, marine batteries, and all-electric power architecture. A cost model is proposed to optimise the power system via minimising the fuel consumption and hence, the operational expenses (OPEX). The proposed cost model includes the different types of fuels and a battery cycling and battery energy dissipation term. The result is an optimal energy management system (EMS) based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that is tuned for alternative fuel. The optimised EMS is tested on a commercial LNG vessel, and it enables a more stable use of generators. However, as the paper reveals, optimised control strategies will not yield practical results in reaching international emission targets. Hence, alternative fuels will be pivotal in reducing emissions from shipping.

NA	284975	2022.21320	Review of Alternative Energy Resource for the Future Ship Power	In the near future, reduce emissions from the combustion of the ship's main engine by increasing the propulsion efficiency of ships that are already operating and/or optimizing ship designs during the design process. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has introduced stringent regulations to reduce GHG emissions for the global shipping industry. Another solution to reduce emissions is to use alternative renewable energy and clean. This paper will describe what energy is used for ship propulsion nowadays and other alternative energy sources that can be used for main engines, additional or hybrid power. Wind energy, solar PV, and fuel cells are renewable energy options for small ships' main propulsion, navigation, lighting, and electronic devices. Furthermore, the method used for writing this paper is collecting the best paper and selecting technology alternatives energy that is possible to install on the ship.

NA	285282	2022.21520	OFFSHORE WIND FARMS AND ISOLATED OIL AND GAS PLATFORMS: PERSPECTIVES AND POSSIBILITIES	Single-cycle gas turbines operating at low-efficiency ranges due to redundancy concerns in offshore oil and gas platforms are responsible for considerable amounts of nitrogen oxides and greenhouse gas emissions in some countries. The abundant resource of offshore wind energy constitutes an extraordinary opportunity for reducing such emissions. However, new challenges are introduced when gas-powered generation is partially replaced by wind power. This paper investigates the possibilities provided by a centralized hybrid energy storage system (ESS) for addressing these challenges. It reviews frequency control concepts for isolated grids and discusses the analogous problem of power balancing within the ESS itself. A set of structures for control of the grid frequency and the ESS DC voltage are described and evaluated.

NA	285568	2022.21732	Powering Offshore Installations with Wind Energy	The offshore Oil and Gas industry continues to explore and develop oil and gas fields using installations powered by generators burning either natural gas or marine gas oil (MGO), similar to diesel. There is increasing pressure on the industry to explore and produce hydrocarbons responsibly, cost effectively and with the lowest emissions. By employing renewable sources of power, Waterford Energy Services Inc.'s (WESI) methodology provides a possible solution using Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) to power offshore installations. Various methods are being proposed and developed to maintain production while bringing down overall greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. CO2, NOx, SOx). This paper outlines the methodology used for a conceptual design of a "Plug and Play" hybrid power solution in the Canadian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry. FOWTs are electrically connected to offshore installations such as Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODU), Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) and fixed production platforms in a harsh environment to replace large portions of the onboard power generation. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are incorporated to transition from wind power, increase efficiency, provide safety backup and enhance emissions reduction. The plan includes considerations for the optimal electrical and battery storage topology and the electrical equipment necessary to connect the FOWT Array to the offshore facility. For the purposes of this paper, a representative location was chosen offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada to assess both local conditions and design requirements. WESI has evaluated additional global locations for this FOWT solution. The conceptual design considers the wind turbine power output and examines the components required to deliver the power to the installation's electrical system (e.g. transformers, batteries, switchgear, static and dynamic cables, disconnects, communications/monitoring and required safety systems). Although there have been incremental improvements in emissions via advancements in fuel standards and engine exhaust abatement modifications, the only approach to have a significant step-change improvement in emissions is through replacement of onboard power generation with renewable sources. It anticipated that the installationsâ€™ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be reduced in excess of 70% by combining wind power and battery supplementation. Oil and Gas operations are ideal applications of this decarbonization approach, presenting an opportunity to mature FOWT technology which can readily adapt to other grid isolated applications such as Remote Communities, Aquaculture and near-shore Industries.

NA	326845	2022.2456	Optimizing hybrid offshore wind farms for cost-competitive hydrogen production in Germany	Nearly 96% of the world's current hydrogen production comes from fossil-fuel-based sources, contributing to global greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen is often discussed as a critical lever in decarbonizing future power systems. Producing hydrogen using unsold offshore wind electricity may offer a low-carbon production pathway and emerging business model. This study investigates whether participating in an ancillary service market is cost competitive for offshore wind-based hydrogen production. It also determines the optimal size of a hydrogen electrolyser relative to an offshore wind farm. Two flexibility strategies for offshore wind farms are developed in this study: an optimal bidding strategy into ancillary service markets for offshore wind farms that build hydrogen production facilities and optimal sizing of Power-to-Hydrogen (PtH) facilities at wind farms. Using empirical European power market and wind generation data, the study finds that offshore-wind based hydrogen must participate in ancillary service markets to generate net positive revenues at current levels of wind generation to become cost competitive in Germany. The estimated carbon abatement cost of â€œgreenâ€ hydrogen ranges between 187 EUR/tonCO2e and 265 EUR/tonCO2e. Allowing hydrogen producers to receive similar subsidies as offshore wind farms that produce only electricity could facilitate further cost reduction. Utilizing excess and intermittent offshore wind highlights one possible pathway that could achieve increasing returns on greenhouse gas emission reductions due to technological learning in hydrogen production, even under conditions where low power prices make offshore wind less competitive in the European electricity market.

NA	251445	2022.2750	Sustainable Hybrid Marine Power Systems for Power Management Optimisation: A Review	The increasing environmental concerns due to emissions from the shipping industry have accelerated the interest in developing sustainable energy sources and alternatives to traditional hydrocarbon fuel sources to reduce carbon emissions. Predominantly, a hybrid power system is used via a combination of alternative energy sources with hydrocarbon fuel due to the relatively small energy efficiency of the former as compared to the latter. For such a hybrid system to operate efficiently, the power management on the multiple power sources has to be optimised and the power requirements for different vessel types with varying loading operation profiles have to be understood. This can be achieved by using energy management systems (EMS) or power management systems (PMS) and control methods for hybrid marine power systems. This review paper focuses on the different EMSs and control strategies adopted to optimise power management as well as reduce fuel consumption and thus the carbon emission for hybrid vessel systems. This paper first presents the different commonly used hybrid propulsion systems, i.e., dieselâ€“mechanical, dieselâ€“electric, fully electric and other hybrid systems. Then, a comprehensive review of the different EMSs and control method strategies is carried out, followed by a comparison of the alternative energy sources to diesel power. Finally, the gaps, challenges and future works for hybrid systems are discussed.

NA	27380	2022.3106	Shore power as a first step toward shipping decarbonization and related policy impact on a dry bulk cargo carrier	Maritime shipping currently emits 2.89\% of the world greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and it is estimated that the sector will reach the road transportation level by 2060. International environmental regulations push the industry to lower their GHG emissions, but the feasibility and viability of future green energy is uncertain. This paper presents a road towards green maritime shipping by proposing shore power, also known as cold ironing or alternative marine power, as a key measure to decarbonize the industry. Therefore, transition pathways and the available measures to decarbonize the industry are analyzed. A theoretical description of shore power along with a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis of the technology is discussed. The paper is also supported with a test case on a real bulk carrier to measure the score improvement of shore power on the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and the Carbon Intensity Index (CII). In summary, shore power can reduce GHG and air polluting emissions at ports right now and across the world. The case of study determined that shore power could improve CII by 7.8\% and policy modifications have been presented to include shore power in EEDI and EEXI calculations. Most of all, shore power can eliminate 100\% of emissions of ships at berth right now. Furthermore, shore power is a prime mover for the development of new maritime applications like hybridization and electrification. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

NA	284948	2022.5987	Hybrid power and propulsion systems for ships: Current status and future challenges	Increasing environmental concerns are driving the shipping industry to take strict measures to deal with greenhouse gas emissions. International Maritime Organization drives the industry to find more efficient and environmentally friendly power systems. To mitigate harmful emissions, researches on marine alternative fuels, operational improvements like slow steaming or predictive maintenance, and additional emission abatement technologies are not sufficient. The use of electricity as the main energy vector is one of the ways to improve the shipping propulsion system's efficiency. In this study, power generation technologies, energy storage components, energy management systems, and hybrid propulsion topologies are reviewed. Diesel engines, fuel cells, solar and wind power as renewable energy sources are discussed as power generation units. On the energy storage side, batteries, supercapacitors, and flywheels are presented and described. Three common hybrid propulsion configurations, serial, parallel, and serial-parallel architectures are detailed with their pros and cons by highlighting commonly used energy management systems and optimization methods. Lastly, criteria for hybrid system selection are defined according to eight different ship types and assessed by providing a generic methodological approach. It is shown that electrical components and architectural design should be elaborated according to operational and architectural characteristics for ships. In short term, it is concluded that internal combustion engines are still the major hybridization element with different energy storage systems. New regulations on the mitigation of harmful emissions will accelerate the transition to hybrid power which is an important option for the ultimate zero-carbon shipping goal.

NA	372886	1991.3190	Concept design for artificial upwelling induced by natural forces	Conceptual designs of an underwater upwelling flexible pipe and a bellows pump are used to pump deep seawater by three natural forces solar heat, wind, and waves. For the solar heat, a parabolic collector and a Stirling engine are suggested as the means to convert solar energy into dynamic energy. It is estimated that a 20-30 m$+$/ collector may be enough to pump 1 CMS seawater from 300 m depth. A conventional wind mill can be selected to absorb wind energy. Six wind mills of 5 m diameter can have the same performance in a wind speed of 7 m/s, if the efficiency of the wind mill is 20%. A spar buoy is proposed to pump water by its heaving in waves. Six buoys of 1 m diameter can do the same job as the wind mills, with only 6% of the wave power is used. The buoy is cheaper and more reliable. Waves are suggested as the most promising natural force to generate an artificial upwelling.	pipe - design;  pumps, artificial upwelling;  bellows pump;  conceptual design;  upwelling pipe;  wave energy, ocean engineering	1991	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

NA	56831	1998.938	The Ultimate Ocean Ranch	Significant expansion of global food supply will require new advancements of similar impact to the Green Revolution. The Ultimate Ocean Ranch envisions enhancement of open-sea biological productivity through artificial upwelling of deep-ocean nutrients by means of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC); food products will be derived by management of integrated ``floating grazing platforms,{''} which could also enhance atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration and net oxygen production in the photic zone. Some of the required technologies exist; some must be developed. Commercialization of the concept will be required; this in turn will require the fullest possible integration of value-generating activities. We estimate, from typical ecological parameters and from some assumptions that can only be evaluated through research, that about \$ 3.3 M in aquatic food products could be produced annually from the water-pumping capability of a hypothetical 10-MW OTEC plant. This is not a large return on investment, but it precedes research and engineering development; other values will be generated. The urgency of the food problem and the lack of nullifying obstacles indicates further evaluation of this concept.

NA	13279	2003.231	Offsetting the radiative benefit of ocean iron fertilization by enhancing N2O emissions	Ocean iron fertilization is being considered as a strategy for mitigating the buildup of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere. Assessment of this strategy requires consideration of its unintended consequences, such as an enhancement of ocean N2O emissions. This feedback could offset the radiative benefit from the atmospheric CO2 reduction significantly, because N2O is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2 itself. Our model results show that the magnitude of this offsetting effect is substantial, but is highly dependent on the location and duration of fertilization. We find the largest offsets (of the order of 100\%) when fertilization is undertaken in the tropics, particularly when it is of limited duration and size. Smaller, but still substantial effects are found when fertilization is undertaken elsewhere and over longer periods. These results suggest that any assessment of ocean fertilization as a mitigating option is incomplete without consideration of the N2O feedback.

NA	368335	2003.2820	Enhancing fish stocks with wave-powered artificial upwelling	Ocean fisheries are declining worldwide due to overexploitation. Productivity could be enhanced and the problem alleviated by pumping nutrient-rich deep ocean water (DOW) to the surface to feed phytoplankton, the bottom end of a marine food chain, mimicking natural upwelling which sustains the most productive ocean fishing grounds in the world. Various pump types and power sources have been proposed for this purpose. The present article proposes a simple wave-powered pump to demonstrate the concept cost-effectively at prototype scale. Possible solutions to the problems of dilution and plunging of dense, nutrient-rich DOW are discussed. Two further possible benefits of this proposal are discussed: by extracting wave energy, relatively calm fishing grounds may be created close to markets, and by pumping up very large quantities of cold DOW, the surface temperature could be lowered enough to reduce coral bleaching on parts of the Great Barrier Reef.

NA	367873	2003.5402	Artificial upwelling and near-field mixing of deep-ocean water effluent	Deep-ocean water (DOW) at a depth of 300 m or lower is cold, nutrient-rich, and free of pathogenic bacteria. This water is considered an important natural resource. One of the fully developed technologies of DOW application is ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), which makes use of DOW for energy production. In recent years, the potential of DOW to enrich the open oceans and thus to increase fish yield has attracted the attention of researchers. Before this potential can be realized, however, major scientific and technological developments concerning artificial upwelling, plume mixing, and DOW stimulated bio-productivity must be achieved. This study, which is a continuation of earlier research on artificial upwelling at the University of Hawaii, investigates the effects of discharging artificially upwelled DOW into the open ocean where it is subsequently mixed with surface water. The study involves both hydraulic modeling and numerical simulation, and its objective is to control the near-field mixing of DOW effluent such that the dilution is small and the settling depth does not go below the euphotic zone. Special attention is given to wave effects on the near-field mixing processes. Research results indicate that, with proper effluent control, desirable nutrient-rich DOW plumes can be established and maintained in the open ocean.	bacteria;  effluents;  oceanography;  thermal plumes, thermal energy, marine engineering, deep water;  mixing;  nutrient enrichment;  plume;  upwelling;  wave action, bacteria (microorganisms)	2003	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
NA	56433	2008.1561	Building relationships between scientists and business in ocean iron fertilization	The potential use of ocean iron fertilization (OIF) as a tool for either carbon reduction projects like those used to generate carbon credits or offsets, or for larger-scale mitigation to remove a significant percentage of CO2 from the atmosphere has interested the private sector. Scientists have highlighted the additional research that must be completed to understand the efficacy and impact of OIF at either scale. Carbon markets also place requirements on the nature of the credits generated if they are to be trusted and valued. The challenge for the future is to find effective ways for the science, business and carbon market communities to collaborate in ways that adhere to the high standards of scientific research, A code of conduct that recognizes the needs for scientific excellence and transparency, carbon market quality controls, and regulatory requirements like permitting can facilitate collaboration.	ocean iron fertilization; carbon mitigation; carbon markets	2008	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	6318	2008.184	Ocean iron fertilization and international law	Intentional ocean fertilization and the commercial sale of associated carbon offsets raise a number of issues in international law. On the one hand, states are obliged to adopt adaptation and mitigation measures to prevent dangerous climate change. On the other hand, international law obliges states to protect and preserve the marine environment and to act in a precautionary manner in the face of scientific uncertainty. In this article, we examine the application of the international Law of the Sea to ocean fertilization, with particular reference to the law's dumping regime, which prohibits the dumping of wastes or other materials from vessels into the ocean. We then examine the application of the international legal regime on climate change to ocean fertilization and assess the international legal basis for the sale of carbon offsets or carbon credits associated with ocean fertilization. We conclude that ocean fertilization is governed by the dumping regime and that its commercialization is inconsistent with international law unless and until independent, internationally peer-reviewed scientific research and assessment demonstrates that it is effective and that its benefits outweigh the risks to the marine environment.	international law; law of the sea; ocean fertilization; ocean dumping; london convention; london protocol	2008	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
NA	13311	2008.373	Predicting and verifying the intended and unintended consequences of large-scale ocean iron fertilization	Ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is being considered as a strategy for mitigating rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. One model for implementation is the sale of carbon offsets. Modeling studies predict that OIF has the potential to produce a material difference in the rise of atmospheric CO2 over the next several decades, but this could only be attained by alteration of the ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles of much of the world's oceans. The efficacy of OIF on this scale has not been proven. However, the consequences of successful implementation must be considered now, for 2 important reasons: (1) to determine if the environmental effects would be predictable and verifiable, and if so, acceptable; and (2) to establish whether the basis for valuing carbon offsets-an accurate audit of net reductions in cumulative greenhouse gas potential over 100 yr-can be met. Potential side-effects of widespread OIF that must be considered include a reduced supply of macronutrients to surface waters downstream of fertilized regions, increased emissions of the potent greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and methane, and changes in the extent or frequency of coastal hypoxia. Given the uncertainties inherent in ocean models, predictions of environmental effects must be backed up by measurements. Thus, to go forward with confidence that the effects of rising CO2 could indeed be mitigated through OIF over the next century, and to establish the foundations for auditing carbon offsets, it must be explicitly demonstrated that methods exist to predict and detect downstream effects of OIF against the background of both climate variability and global warming. We propose that until the side-effects of widespread OIF can be shown to be verifiable-and there is good reason to believe that they cannot - OIF should not be considered a viable technology for climate mitigation.	ocean fertilization; climate change; climate change mitigation; carbon offsets; ecological effects; hypoxia; nitrous oxide	2008	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	13655	2008.385	Climate change, ocean processes and ocean iron fertilization	Observations indicate that the rate of increase in concentration of atmospheric CO2 is increasing faster than projected in any of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios. Several mitigation measures, referred to as `geoengineering options', have been proposed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. To be successful, such a mitigation operation must remove `significant' CO2 from the atmosphere for many decades, be verifiable, and not cause deleterious side effects. One option, purposeful addition of iron to fertilize photosynthetic uptake Of CO2 by phytoplankton in regions of the ocean where iron is a limiting nutrient, has received considerable scientific attention. In the last 15 yr, a dozen small-scale open ocean iron fertilization experiments have been performed and a succession of models of large-scale fertilization have been developed. As successive models have become more realistic, the amounts Of CO2 forecast to be sequestered have dropped, and in all cases are small relative to the amounts Of CO2 projected to be released through fossil fuel burning over the next century for any of the IPCC emission scenarios. Possible side effects include a long term reduction in ocean productivity, alteration of the structure of marine food webs, and a more rapid increase in ocean acidity. Most importantly, increased remineralization associated with the increased downward export of organic carbon particles would result: in increased production of the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas, N2O. The magnitude of this effect is poorly known.	climate change; iron fertilization; mitigation; ocean carbon cycle	2008	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0
NA	277329	2010.1051	An open ocean trial of controlled upwelling using wave pump technology	In 1976, John D. Isaacs proposed to use wave energy to invert the density structure of the ocean and pump deep, nutrient-rich water into the sunlit surface layers. The basic principle is simple: a length of tubing attached to a surface buoy at the top, and a one-way valve at the bottom can be extended below the euphotic zone to act as a conduit for deep water. The vertical motion of the ocean forces the attached valve to open on the downslope of a wave and close on the upslope, thus generating upward movement of deep water to the surface ocean. Although Isaacs's wave-powered pump has taken many forms, from energy production to aquaculture to the more recent suggestion that artificial upwelling could be used to stimulate primary productivity and carbon sequestration, the simple engineering concept remains the same. In June 2008, the authors tested a commercially available wave pump (Atmocean) north of Oahu, Hawaii, to assess the logistics of at-sea deployment and the durability of the equipment under open ocean conditions. This test was done as part of an experiment designed to evaluate a recently published hypothesis that upwelling of water containing excess phosphate (P) relative to nitrogen (N) compared to the canonical "Redfield" molar ratio of 16N:1P would generate a two-phased phytoplankton bloom. The end result of this field experiment was rapid delivery (&lt;2 h for a 300-m transit) of deep water to the surface ocean followed by catastrophic failure of pump materials under the dynamic stresses of the oceanic environment. Wave-driven upwelling of cold water was documented for a period of ~17 h, with a volumetric upwelling rate of ~45 m3 h-1 and an estimated total input of 765 m3 of nutrient-enriched deep water. The authors discuss the deployment of a 300-m wave pump, the strategy to sample a biogeochemical response, the engineering challenges faced, and the implications of these results for future experiments aimed at stimulating the growth of phytoplankton.

NA	276761	2010.312	Ocean iron fertilization: Why further research is needed	Despite large uncertainties in the fertilization efficiency, natural iron fertilization studies and some of the purposeful iron enrichment studies have demonstrated that Southern Ocean iron fertilization can lead to a significant export of carbon from the sea surface to the ocean interior. From an economic perspective the potential of ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is far from negligible in relation to other abatement options. Comparing the range of cost estimates to the range of estimates for forestation projects they are in the same order of magnitude, but OIF could provide more carbon credits even if high discount rates are used to account for potential leakage and non-permanence. However, the uncertainty about undesired adverse effects of purposeful iron fertilization on marine ecosystems and biogeochemistry has led to attempts to ban commercial and, to some extent, scientific experiments aimed at a better understanding of the processes involved, effectively precluding further consideration of this mitigation option. As regards the perspective of public international law, the pertinent agreements dealing with the protection of the marine environment indicate that OIF is to be considered as lawful if and to the extent to which it represents legitimate scientific research. In this respect, the precautionary principle can be used to balance the risks arising out of scientific OIF activities for the marine environment with the potential advantages relevant to the objectives of the climate change regime. As scientific OIF experiments involve only comparatively small negative impacts within a limited marine area, further scientific research must be permitted to explore the carbon sequestration potential of OIF in order to either reject this concept or integrate it into the flexible mechanisms contained in the Kyoto Protocol.

NA	277375	2010.326	Ocean iron fertilization in the context of the Kyoto protocol and the post-Kyoto process	Ocean iron fertilization is currently discussed as a potential measure to mitigate climate change by enhancing oceanic CO2 uptake. Its mitigation potential is not yet well explored, and carbon offsets generated through iron fertilization activities could currently not be traded on regulated carbon markets. Still, commercial interests in ocean iron fertilization already exist, which underlines the need to investigate a possible regulatory framework for it. To this end, I first discuss important basic aspects of ocean iron fertilization, namely its scientific background, quantitative potential, side effects, and costs. In a second step, I review regulatory aspects connected to ocean iron fertilization, like its legal status and open access issues. Moreover, I analyze how the regulations for afforestation and reforestation activities within the framework of the Kyoto Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could be applied to ocean iron fertilization. Main findings are that the quantitative potential of ocean iron fertilization is limited, that costs are higher than initially hoped, and that potential adverse side effects are severe. Moreover, the legal status of ocean iron fertilization is currently not well defined, open access might cause inefficiencies, and the CDM regulations could not be easily applied to ocean iron fertilization.

NA	239058	2010.7403	Environmental, legal and social implications of ocean urea fertilization: Sulu sea example	Ocean urea fertilization is one geoengineering proposal aimed at not only reducing the atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide but also increasing fish populations in nutrient poor areas of the ocean. Theoretically ocean fertilization promises great benefits but there is also the possibility of serious environmental damage to consider. The nature of ocean urea fertilization means it is more likely to be carried out in coastal waters, providing States with different powers to enforce their laws compared to ocean iron fertilization which is more suitable to waters beyond national jurisdiction. This paper considers the process and effect urea, when used for the purpose of ocean fertilization, may have on the marine environment as well as the social implications, particularly for coastal and island people in developing nations.

NA	276636	2010.860	Methods for greenhouse gas offset accounting: A case study of ocean iron fertilization	Reducing atmospheric carbon concentration by removing past emissions can extend our rapidly diminishing emission budgets corresponding to the target of limiting the temperature increase to 2 Â°C above preindustrial levels. Forestation measures to offset carbon emissions have already entered the Kyoto Protocol. Other carbon offset options like ocean iron fertilization or chemically enhanced weathering are currently being analyzed. The analysis and comparison of such options requires determination of the amount of carbon credits generated that can be used for compliance. In our analysis we assess the impact of various accounting methods applied to large-scale sink enhancement projects, taking into account the partly temporary storage characteristics arising from such projects. We apply the various accounting methods to hypothetical large-scale Southern Ocean iron fertilization projects for different durations. From an economic perspective, issuing temporary carbon credits would provide the largest number of carbon credits at an early stage. This is equivalent to the existing tCER regulation under the Kyoto Protocol. Issuing temporary carbon credits for short-term ocean iron fertilization would also benefit the environment, as all credits would have to be replaced in the next commitment period. As some carbon will be stored permanently, this reduces atmospheric carbon concentration.

NA	6808	2011.289	The Potential of Ocean Iron Fertilization as an Option for Mitigating Climate Change	Ocean iron fertilization is currently being discussed as one measure that could contribute to climate change mitigation by stimulating the growth of phytoplankton in certain parts of the ocean and enhancing oceanic CO2 uptake. Its implementation is greatly debated however and its mitigation potential has not yet been explored well. At present, it is still not possible to use carbon offsets generated through iron fertilization projects for complying with the Kyoto Protocol as trading these offsets is currently only possible on voluntary carbon markets. Company interests in such a commercial use of ocean iron fertilization do however already exist. Consequently, there is a need to explore the potential of ocean iron fertilization as a climate change mitigation option as well as regulatory issues connected with its implementation. This article combines these two aims by first examining the scientific background, quantitative potential, side effects and costs of ocean iron fertilization. In a second step, regulatory aspects such as its legal status and open access issues are reviewed. Moreover, the chapter analyses how the regulations for afforestation and reforestation activities within the framework of the Kyoto Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could be applied to ocean iron fertilization. The main findings of this chapter are that the quantitative potential of ocean iron fertilization is limited, that potential adverse side effects are severe, and that its costs are higher than it was initially hoped. Moreover, the legal status of ocean iron fertilization is currently not well defined, open access might cause inefficiencies, and the CDM regulations could not be easily applied to ocean iron fertilization.	cdm; kyoto protocol; ocean iron fertilization	2011	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0
NA	274212	2012.603	Economic prospects of ocean iron fertilization in an international carbon market	Staying within the 2Â° C temperature increase target for climate change requires for ambitious emission reduction targets for the 2012-2020 compliance period. Cost-efficiency is a crucial criterion for the achievement of such targets, requiring analyses of all possible options. Enhancing the oceanic carbon sink via ocean iron fertilization (OIF) provides such an option. Our analysis reveals that the critical unit costs per net ton of CO 2 sequestered by OIF range from 22 to 28 USD (price level 2000) in a post-Kyoto compliance scenario. The critical unit costs are defined as those that would make an emitter indifferent between various abatement options. With reference to hypothetical short-term large-scale Southern Ocean OIF we are able to show that seven years of OIF provide a number of credits exceeding those obtainable from global forestation projects lasting 20 years. From an economic perspective, our results indicate that OIF can be considered a potentially viable carbon-removal option. However, further research is needed, especially on adverse side-effects and their ecological and economical consequences.

NA	195271	2014.8908	Experimental and Analytical investigations of Wave-Induced Artificial Upwelling	Artificial upwelling is supposed to be a general technique to enhance the marine primary productivity and fishery resources by means of pumping the nutrient-rich deep ocean water (DOW) to the euphotic layer. The wave energy is the most conspicuous form of ocean energy, the extraction of energy from the waves can be a viable economic solution to the power requirements of artificial upwelling. To extract the wave energy, a structure which responds to the input wave motion is required. This paper presents our latest investigation on the wave-induced artificial upwelling device by a fixed rigid pipe submerged in the water. In this study, we improve the theoretical methods, and the calculated results are verified by the wave-tank experiments. It turns out that the upwelling rate was affected of the wave height H, the wave period H, the water depth h, the length of the pipe L and diameter of the pipe d, etc. Based on the theoretical calculations and experimental results, we can estimate the upwelling flow rate of the wave-induced artificial upwelling device applied in the open sea.	artificial upwelling; wave-induced upwelling; wave tank	2014	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	265146	2015.12759	Climate intervention: Carbon dioxide removal and reliable sequestration	The signals are everywhere that our planet is experiencing significant climate change. It is clear that we need to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from our atmosphere if we want to avoid greatly increased risk of damage from climate change. Aggressively pursuing a program of emissions abatement or mitigation will show results over a timescale of many decades. How do we actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make a bigger difference more quickly? As one of a two-book report, this volume of Climate Intervention discusses CDR, the carbon dioxide removal of greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere and sequestration of it in perpetuity. Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration introduces possible CDR approaches and then discusses them in depth. Land management practices, such as low-till agriculture, reforestation and afforestation, ocean iron fertilization, and land-and-ocean-based accelerated weathering, could amplify the rates of processes that are already occurring as part of the natural carbon cycle. Other CDR approaches, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration, direct air capture and sequestration, and traditional carbon capture and sequestration, seek to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and dispose of it by pumping it underground at high pressure. This book looks at the pros and cons of these options and estimates possible rates of removal and total amounts that might be removed via these methods. With whatever portfolio of technologies the transition is achieved, eliminating the carbon dioxide emissions from the global energy and transportation systems will pose an enormous technical, economic, and social challenge that will likely take decades of concerted effort to achieve.

NA	337791	2015.13578	Environmental impact assessment for an OTEC plant in Martinique Island [MÃ©thodologie d'Ã©tude des impacts d'une centrale d'Ã©nergie thermique des mers (ETM) en Martinique]	The Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) is a marine renewable energy system that uses the temperature difference between the cold deep waters and warm surface waters to produce electricity. DCNS, a world-expert in naval defence and an innovator in energy has conducted technical, juridical and environmental feasibility studies of a plant offshore Martinique under an agreement with the Regional Council. In this context, DCNS realised a preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment in order to prepare public debate to be done further. Due to innovation of such a project, a specific methodology has been done for that. First step was to study bibliography in details, for site assessment of course, but also for impacts of other projects in the world that should present relevant similarities with OTEC (coastal thermal power plants for example). This bibliographic study dealt with thematic synthesis for each topic of physical, biological and human field that could be impacted by the project (total of 28 topics). The aim was to define priorities for specific assessments that have been done further: acoustic impacts, biogeochemical impacts of artificial upwelling, biofouling impacts, etc. Some of these topics are now on course with specific scientific research programs that have been launched at the end of this study. For each new topic, a specific methodology has been used or adapted for OTEC. These methods are made step by step, with a preliminary approach followed by a specific research program when it is necessary. Noise prediction has been done with a specific tool used for ship construction industry and a 3D propagation modelling. Biofouling has been assessed by a bibliographic approach and will be prÃ©cised further with experimental moorings. Biogeochemical and biological impacts due to artificial and localised upwelling are now being studied in details with a double skill approach (physical modelling and plankton analysis), after preliminary water chemicals' analysis and modelling.

NA	265441	2015.2093	Evaluation of the sinks and sources of atmospheric CO2 by artificial upwelling	Artificial upwelling is considered a promising way to reduce the accumulation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This practice could transport nutrient-rich deep water to the euphotic zone, enhance phytoplankton growth and consequently increase organic carbon exportation to the deep ocean via the biological pump. However, only a few studies quantitatively assess changes in oceanic CO2 uptake resulting from artificial upwelling. This article uses a simulation to examine the effect of hypothetical artificial upwelling-induced variations of CO2 fugacity in seawater (fCO2) using observed carbon and nutrient data from 14 stations, ranging from 21 to 43Â°N, in the West Philippine Sea (WPS), the East China Sea (ECS) and the Sea of Japan. Calculations are based on two basic assumptions: First, a near-field mixing of a nutrient-rich deep-ocean water plume in a stratified ocean environment is assumed to form given the presence of an artificial upwelling devise with appropriate technical parameters. Second, it is assumed that photosynthesis of marine phytoplankton could deplete all available nutrients following the stoichiometry of the modified Redfield ratio C/H/O/N/S/P=103.1/181.7/93.4/11.7/2.1/1. Results suggest artificial upwelling has significant effects on regional changes in sea-air differences (Î´fCO2sea-air) and the carbon sequestration potential (Î´fCO2mixed-amb). Large variations of Î´fCO2sea-air and Î´fCO2mixed-amb are shown to be associated with different regions, seasons and technical parameters of the artificial upwelling device. With proper design, it is possible to reverse the contribution of artificial upwelling from a strong CO2 source to sink. Thus, artificial upwelling has the potential to succeed as a geoengineering technique to sequester anthropogenic CO2, with appropriate technical parameters in the right region and season.

NA	227859	2016.12663	Artificial upwelling using offshore wind energy for mariculture applications	Offshore wind is proposed as an energy source to upwell nutrient-rich deep water to the ocean photic layers. A spar-buoy wind turbine with a rigid tube about 300 m long is proposed as a pipe to drive deep water up to the surface. The minimum energy required to uplift the water is the potential energy difference between surface waters inside and outside the pipe, which depends on the background density profile. The corresponding surface jump or hydraulic head, h, calculated for several analytical and experimental density profiles, is of the order of 10 cm. If the complete turbine power (of the order of several MW) is used for raising the water (assuming a 100\% pump efficiency), in a frictionless flow, very large water volumes, of the order of thousands of m(3) s(-1), will be transported to the photic layers. In a more realistic case, taking into account pipe friction in wide pipes, of the order of 10 m radius, and a power delivered to the fluid of 1 MW, the volume transport is still very large, about 500 m(3) s(-1). However, such a large amount of dense water could sink fast to aphotic layers due to vertical static instability (the fountain effect), ruining the enhancement of primary production. Hence, some ways to increase the turbulent entrainment and avoid the fountain effect are proposed. From the energetic viewpoint, artificial upwelling using offshore wind energy is a promising way to fertilize large open sea regions. This mariculture application is, however, severely subjected to atmosphere and ocean climatology, as well as to ecological dynamics. The general problem is multidisciplinary, and some important physical, engineering and ecological questions need to be seriously addressed to improve our confidence in the approach presented here.	artificial upwelling; mariculture applications; ocean fertilization; offshore wind energy; spar-buoy wind turbine	2016	Devi	NA	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	263395	2016.14287	Ocean applications for carbon dioxide sequestration	Increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is being attributed to the adverse effects such as warming of the planet; increase in the sea level; variation in the atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns; snow cover variation; and, sea ice extent. One of the common approaches followed in the mitigation efforts is the study on the reduction of the emissions of CO2 from the major point sources such as coal fired power plants, steel plants, cement industries. Direct injection of the carbon dioxide into the deep oceans, mineral carbonation applications, in situ replacement of the gas hydrate into the carbon dioxide hydrates, micro algal sequestration and iron fertilization are some of the ocean sequestration options studied in the literature. Present chapter studies the feasibility of different ocean sequestration methods in comparison with the technological requirements for the realization of these methods. The relative merits of the methods, the technological challenges, ecological and environmental issues needing detailed studies for the application are discussed in this chapter. The experiments conducted on the mineral carbonation of industrial wastes such as steel slag using direct and indirect methods are discussed, considering the Linz-Donawitz converter slag. The carbonation efficiency for different conditions is compared and the structure of the resulting materials is analyzed. The prospective applications for coastal protective measures and artificial reef growth and the state of the art in similar applications using the concrete structure are discussed. The chapter discusses in detail the energy requirements in mineral carbonation methodology using the steel slag.

NA	24201	2016.1663	Research progress in artificial upwelling and its potential environmental effects	Artificial upwelling, as a geoengineering tool, has received worldwide attention because it may actualize ocean fertilization in a sustainable way, which could potentially alleviate the pressures on the fish stocks and human-driven climate change in the ocean. We reviewed the current knowledge on the development of an artificial upwelling system and its potential environmental effects. Special attention was given to the research progress on the air-lift concept artificial upwelling by Zhejiang University. The research on artificial upwelling over the past few decades has generated a range of devices that have been successfully applied in the field for months. Based on field experiments and the associated modeling results, part of them reported positive effects on increasing primary production and enhancing CO2 sequestration. However, as a significant disturbance to the environment, especially for large-scale applications, the uncertainties related to the potential effects on ecosystem remain unsolved. Zhejiang University has overcome the technical challenges in designing and fabricating a robust and high efficiency artificial upwelling device which has been examined in two field experiments in Qiandao Lake and one sea trial in the East China Sea. It was investigated that cold and hypoxic deep ocean water (DOW) could be uplifted to the euphotic layer, which could potentially change the nutrient distribution and adjust the N/P ratio. Both simulation and field experiments results confirmed that utilizing self-powered energy to inject compressed air to uplift DOW was a valid and efficient method. Therefore, further field-based research on artificial upwelling, especially for long-term field research is required to test the scientific hypothesis.	artificial upwelling; air-lifting; self-powered; environmental impacts; research progress	2016	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	193466	2017.11487	Feasibility analysis and trial of air-lift artificial upwelling powered by hybrid energy system	Artificial upwelling can lift nutritious deep ocean water to sunlit layer, as a result, it is able to promote primary production and is being paid more and more attention all over the world. Kinds of artificial upwelling method have been invented in recent years, however, few of them can fulfill the requirement of desired flow rate and balanced budget. The design of an air-lift artificial upwelling device powered by hybrid energy system is presented in this paper, where solar, wind and wave energy is exploited together to induce artificial upwelling. The preliminary results of an open sea trial lasted for 7 days have demonstrated that the hybrid system assembled in a floating platform with surface area of 12.5 m(2) can lift 4234 m(3) deep seawater from more than 20 m depth. In particular, the operation based on optimal dispatch strategy showed that the unit cost of induced artificial upwelling is only 0.005 US \$/m(3). The work presented in this paper constitutes a step towards the development of an advanced hybrid energy system used for artificial upwelling.	air-lift pump; artificial upwelling; hybrid energy system	2017	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	18971	2018.1682	Reviews and syntheses: Ocean iron fertilization experiments - past, present, and future looking to a future Korean Iron Fertilization Experiment in the Southern Ocean (KIFES) project	Since the start of the industrial revolution, human activities have caused a rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, which have, in turn, had an impact on climate leading to global warming and ocean acidification. Various approaches have been proposed to reduce atmospheric CO2. The Martin (or iron) hypothesis suggests that ocean iron fertilization (OIF) could be an effective method for stimulating oceanic carbon sequestration through the biological pump in iron-limited, high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions. To test the Martin hypothesis, 13 artificial OIF (aOIF) experiments have been performed since 1990 in HNLC regions. These aOIF field experiments have demonstrated that primary production (PP) can be significantly enhanced by the artificial addition of iron. However, except in the Southern Ocean (SO) European Iron Fertilization Experiment (EIFEX), no significant change in the effectiveness of aOIF (i.e., the amount of iron-induced carbon export flux below the winter mixed layer depth, MLD) has been detected. These results, including possible side effects, have been debated amongst those who support and oppose aOIF experimentation, and many questions concerning the effectiveness of scientific aOIF, environmental side effects, and international aOIF law frameworks remain. In the context of increasing global and political concerns associated with climate change, it is valuable to examine the validity and usefulness of the aOIF experiments. Furthermore, it is logical to carry out such experiments because they allow one to study how plankton-based ecosystems work by providing insight into mechanisms operating in real time and under in situ conditions. To maximize the effectiveness of aOIF experiments under international aOIF regulations in the future, we therefore suggest a design that incorporates several components. (1) Experiments conducted in the center of an eddy structure when grazing pressure is low and silicate levels are high (e.g., in the SO south of the polar front during early summer) (2) Shipboard observations extending over a minimum of similar to 40 days, with multiple iron injections (at least two or three iron infusions of similar to 2000 kg with an interval of similar to 10-15 days to fertilize a patch of 300 km(2) and obtain a similar to 2 nM concentration). (3) Tracing of the iron-fertilized patch using both physical (e.g., a drifting buoy) and biogeochemical (e.g., sulfur hexafluoride, photosynthetic quantum efficiency, and partial pressure of CO2) tracers. (4) Employment of neutrally buoyant sediment traps (NBST) and application of the water-column-derived thorium-234 (Th-234) method at two depths (i.e., just below the in situ MLD and at the winter MLD), with autonomous profilers equipped with an underwater video profiler (UVP) and a transmissometer. (5) Monitoring of side effects on marine/ocean ecosystems, including production of climate-relevant gases (e.g., nitrous oxide, N2O; dimethyl sulfide, DMS; and halogenated volatile organic compounds, HVOCs), decline in oxygen inventory, and development of toxic algae blooms, with optical-sensor-equipped autonomous moored profilers and/or autonomous benthic vehicles. Lastly, we introduce the scientific aOIF experimental design guidelines for a future Korean Iron Fertilization Experiment in the Southern Ocean (KIFES).

NA	52378	2018.3958	Effects of operating parameters and injection method on the performance of an artificial upwelling by using airlift pump	Artificial upwelling by using airlift pump is considered a sustainable way in actualizing ocean fertilization, which could potentially alleviate the pressures on the fish stocks and human-driven climate change. However, few experimental data about the effects of operating parameters and injection method on the performance of the airlift artificial upwelling were found in the literature. In this paper, an airlift pump for artificial upwelling was investigated through three field experiments, in which airlift pumps of pipe length ranges from 20 to 28.3 m and pipe diameter ranges from 0.4 to 2 m, were designed and tested. Pumped water flow rate and injected air flow rate were measured to study the effects of different factors on the performance of airlift pump. The experiment results show that airlift pump efficiency is closely related to pipe diameter, submerged depth, submergence ratio and nozzle designs. There is no best nozzle for all the range of air flow rate, and the recommended nozzles are double-ring-shaped or star-shaped nozzles when the air flow rate is less or more than 220 L/min, respectively. Moreover, the lift effectiveness increases when the hole size of nozzle is enlarged, which indicates a relatively large bubble size will enhance the lift effectiveness.	airlift pump; artificial upwelling; injection method; operating parameters; lift effectiveness	2018	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	254519	2019.17381	Role of the ocean in climate stabilization	The ocean has absorbed over 90% of the heat from recent anthropogenic greenhouse warming. This chapter reviews a variety of ocean-related methods for slowing down and eventually halting this warming. â€œBlue carbonâ€ reservoirs store more carbon than terrestrial equivalents, although are still limited compared with global negative emissions needs. Oceanic carbon uptake could be augmented via iron fertilization, although this method presents challenges. Algal-based biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (ABECCS) offers opportunities for carbon-neutral fuel alternatives as well as for negative emissions. Total carbon dioxide removal potential is estimated at 15-33 Pg CO2/year by mid-century and 33-95 Pg CO2/year by the end of the century, which could offset current and projected CO2 emissions. ABECCS can also coproduce high-protein feed for aquaculture and reduce demand for agricultural land. Combined with effective ocean blue carbon management and terrestrial methods, ocean-based carbon removal can play a critical role in climate stabilization. Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

NA	305747	2019.2272	Energy management and operational planning of an ecological engineering for carbon sequestration in coastal mariculture environments in China	China is now accelerating the development of an ecological engineering for carbon sequestration in coastal mariculture environments to cope with climate change. Artificial upwelling as the ecological engineering can mix surface water with bottom water and bring rich nutrients to the euphotic zone, enhance seaweed growth in the oligotrophic sea area, and then increase coastal carbon sequestration. However, one of the major obstacles of the artificial upwelling is the high energy consumption. This study focused on the development of energy management technology for air-lift artificial upwelling by optimizing air injection rate. The fundamental principle underlying this technology is that the mode and intensity of air injection are adjusted from the feedback of information on velocity variation in tidal currents, illumination, and temperature of the surface layer. A series of equations to control air injection was derived based on seaweed growth and solar power generation. Although this finding was originally developed for the air-lift artificial upwelling, it also can be used in other areas of engineering, such as water delivery, aeration, and oxygenation. The simulations show that using a variable air injection rate can lift more nitrogen nutrients of 28.2 mol than using a fixed air injection rate of 26.6 mol, mostly with the same energy cost.

NA	55409	2020.5090	Intelligent Control System of an Ecological Engineering Project for Carbon Sequestration in Coastal Mariculture Environments in China	As an ecological engineering project, artificial upwelling can enhance seaweed growth in the oligotrophic sea area by lifting bottom water, which is rich in nutrients, to the surface and thereby increase coastal carbon sequestration. Generally, engineering projects producing artificial upwelling occur far away from land and are self-powered using offshore solar energy or wind energy. The key to successfully implementing such engineering projects is to produce artificial upwelling with limited energy. With this in mind, an intelligent control system is designed for the energy management of the artificial upwelling engineering project that operates at AoShan Bay in Qingdao, China. This engineering project uses artificial upwelling to assist in the cultivation of macroalgae. The intelligent control system can automatically produce upwelling according to the battery condition and guarantee safety during operation. Meanwhile, users can monitor the system in real time with a Cloud platform. The functioning of the system and the effect of upwelling are confirmed by a sea trial. This research provides guidelines and technical support for the future design of intelligent control systems mounted on artificial upwelling engineering projects.	intelligent control system; artificial upwelling; monitoring system; carbon sequestration	2020	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	298207	2021.1963	Seeking natural analogs to fast-forward the assessment of marine CO2 removal	Mitigating global climate change will require gigaton-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) as a supplement to rapid emissions reduction. The oceans cover 71% of the Earth surface and have the potential to provide much of the required CDR. However, none of the proposed marine CDR (mCDR) methods is sufficiently well understood to determine their real-world efficiency and environmental side effects. Here, we argue that using natural mCDR analogs should become the third interconnecting pillar in the mCDR assessment as they bridge the gap between numerical simulations (i.e., large scale/reduced complexity) and experimental studies (i.e., small scale/high complexity). Natural mCDR analogs occur at no cost, can provide a wealth of data to inform mCDR, and do not require legal permission or social license for their study. We propose four simple criteria to identify particularly useful analogs: 1) large scale, 2) abruptness of perturbation, 3) availability of unperturbed control sites, and 4) reoccurrence. Based on these criteria, we highlight four examples: 1) equatorial upwelling as a natural analog for artificial upwelling, 2) downstream of Kerguelen Island for ocean iron fertilization, 3) the Black and Caspian Seas for ocean alkalinity enhancement, and 4) the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt for ocean afforestation. These natural analogs provide a reality check for experimental assessments and numerical modeling of mCDR. Ultimately, projections of mCDR efficacy and sustainability supported by observations from natural analogs will provide the real-world context for the public debate and will facilitate political decisions on mCDR implementation. We anticipate that a rigorous investigation of natural analogs will fast-forward the urgently needed assessment of mCDR. Â© 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Public attitudes are vital for emerging technologies: publics influence political mandates, help determine the degree of uptake by market actors, and are key to realizing broader ambitions for robust decision-making and responsible incentivization. Discourses surrounding ocean NETs will also have fundamental effects on how governance for the techniques emerges, shaping how they are defined as an object of governance, who is assigned the authority to govern, and what instruments are deemed appropriate. This Perspective brings together key insights on the societal dimensions of ocean NETs, drawing on existing work on public acceptability, policy assessment, governance, and discourse. Ocean iron fertilization is the only ocean NET on which there exists considerable social science research thus far, and we show that much evidence points against its social desirability. Taken in conjunction with considerable natural science uncertainties, this leads us to question whether further research is actually necessary in order to rule out ocean iron fertilization as an option. For other ocean NETs, there is a need for further research into social dimensions, yet research on analogous technologies shows that ocean interventions will likely evoke strong risk perceptions, and evidence suggests that the majority of ocean NETs may face a greater public acceptability challenge than terrestrial NETs. Ocean NETs also raise complex challenges around governance, which pose questions well-beyond the remit of the natural sciences and engineering. Using a conceptual exploration of the ways in which different types of discourse may shape emerging ocean NETs governance, we show that the very idea of ocean NETs is likely to set the stage for a whole new range of contested futures.

NA	2063	2021.289	Proposing a potential strategy concerning Mineral-enhanced Biological Pump (MeBP) for improving Ocean Iron Fertilization (OIF)	Ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is a geoengineering strategy aimed at mitigating global warming by reducing the amount of atmospheric CO2. However, the efficacy by which OIF vertically exports organic carbon of bloomed phytoplankton (mostly, diatoms) to the deep sea is low because of the remineralization of organic carbon during the sinking of diatomaceous silica (BSi). To address the low efficiency of the vertical C export of OIF, a potential strategy for enhancing oceanic biological pump using clay minerals, so-called mineral-enhanced biological pump (MeBP), is proposed herein. Under ideal operation of MeBP, the purposefully added clay minerals are supposed to agglomerate with BSi, facilitating an increase in the quantity of BSi settling and a decrease of organic carbon loss. Meanwhile, the structural Al of clay minerals would be assimilated by diatoms due to the biological dissolution of the clays, inhibiting the dissolution of BSi during its sinking. The abovementioned effects would significantly improve the efficiency of the vertical C export of OIF. The preliminary evidence and arguments in support of MeBP are presented.	clay minerals; diatoms; ocean iron fertilization (oif); co2 sequestration; biological pump	2021	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is a geoengineering strategy aimed at mitigating global warming through human intervention. The OIF concept is based on the idea that artificial adding of iron nutrients into iron-depleted regions of the ocean will lead to a rapid boost of phytoplankton populations and the mass sinking of organic matter that ultimately leads to the sequestration of significant amounts of atmospheric CO2 in the deep sea and sediments. The OIF experiments have been conducted in past over the time and the space scales of weeks and kilometres in polar, subpolar and tropical areas of the oceans. The results have generated new knowledge and a better understanding of the role of iron in regulating marine ecosystems and have confirmed that the iron supply is one of the key controls on the dynamics of phytoplankton blooms, such as diatom as the base of the marine food chain, which in turn affect the whole biogeochemical cycling of carbon. However, the OIF as an effective carbon control strategy is not adequately supported with concerns about potential significant impacts on marine ecosystems. The iron fertilization also did not significantly strengthen the vertical carbon export to the deep sea and thereby the sequestration of CO2. The efficacy by which the OIF vertically exports organic carbon associated with diatom blooms to the deep sea remains constrained due to the remineralization and the loss of organic carbon during the sinking process of diatomaceous biogenic silica (BSi). Therefore, to address these limitations, the next generation of the IOF geoengineering experiments should be designed to improve the low efficiency of the vertical export of bloomed phytoplankton, which will reduce the loss of organic carbon during the sinking of biomass. In our recent studies, we observed a noticeable dissolution-inhibition effect of Al-bearing lake diatomaceous BSi, which is caused by the high content of Al incorporation in the structure of the BSi. This finding inspired a new idea about the possibility of incorporating naturally occurring, environmentally safe and Al-rich minerals as an Al source for the geoengineering experiments. We hypothesize that clay minerals, with characteristically high contents of Al and Si, might be good ingredients for mineral fertilization in geoengineering experiments to enhance the efficiency of the vertical carbon export of the biological pump. This new proposed mineral-aided process is termed mineral-enhanced biological pump (MeBP). In this paper, the concept, background and theoretical basis of MeBP for CO2 sequestration in water bodies as a new and inexpensive geoengineering strategy are explained. The basic idea of the MeBP concept is to use finely grained powders of minerals, such as clay minerals as nutrients for geoengineering or ecological engineering experiment to enhance the efficiency of the complexes of microbial organic matter and minerals and to hinder the loss of particulate organic carbon by adjusting the mineral ratios and regulating the particle properties. If so, the improved carbon sequestration efficiency of the biological pump and the CO2 sink enhancement in water bodies could be achieved. The MeBP offers several potential advantages such as application simplicity, low-cost, scalability, environmental friendliness, and flexibility, and it could be applied alone or in combination with other carbon sequestration strategies. Also, the approaches for the research and application of MeBP, the environmental and ecological risks of applying MeBP and the possible ways of avoiding these risks are discussed. These discussions aim to stimulate new thinking toward the development of new technologies of increasing carbon sink in water bodies that are sustainable, ecologically acceptable and scalable, and can be translated into real applications and engineering practices.

NA	37729	2022.3997	Artificial Upwelling in Singular and Recurring Mode: Consequences for Net Community Production and Metabolic Balance	Artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich waters and the corresponding boost in primary productivity harbor the potential to enhance marine fishery yields and strengthen the biological pump for sequestration of atmospheric CO2. There is increasing urgency to understand this technology as a ``ocean-based solution{''} for counteracting two major challenges of the 21st century-climate change and overfishing. Yet, little is known about the actual efficacy and/or possible side effects of artificial upwelling. We conducted a large-scale off-shore mesocosm study (similar to 44 m(3)) in the oligotrophic waters of the Canary Islands to identify the community-level effects of artificial upwelling on a natural oligotrophic plankton community. Four upwelling intensities were simulated (approx. 1.5/3/5.7/10 mu mol L-1 of nitrate plus phosphate and silicate) via two different upwelling modes (a singular deep-water pulse vs. recurring supply every 4 days) for 37 days. Here we present results on the response of net community production (NCP), metabolic balance and phytoplankton community composition (<250 mu m). Higher upwelling intensities yielded higher cumulative NCP. Following upwelling onset, the phytoplankton community became dominated by diatoms in all treatments, but other taxa such as Coccolithophores increased later in the experiment. The magnitude of effects on the metabolic balance scaled with the amount of added deep water, leading to (i) a balanced to net-heterotrophic system in the singular and (ii) a net-autotrophic system in the recurring upwelling treatments. Accordingly, the mode in which nutrients are supplied to an oligotrophic system plays a crucial role in the ecosystem response, with recurring upwelling leading to higher long-term positive NCP than singular upwelling. These results highlight the importance of empirically measured local responses to upwelling such as community structure and metabolism, with major implications for the potential employment of artificial upwelling as an ocean-based solution to generate (primary) production.	artificial upwelling; metabolic balance; primary production; net community production; mesocosm; chemtax	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	267732	2022.6085	Expected Limits on the Potential for Carbon Dioxide Removal From Artificial Upwelling	Artificial upwelling, the engineered upward pumping of deep ocean water, has long been proposed as a technique to fertilize the ocean and, more recently, remove atmospheric carbon dioxide. This study investigated the potential of artificial upwelling to contribute to carbon dioxide removal using a simple model with high-resolution (1Â° Ã— 1Â°) gridded monthly climatologies of upper ocean and deep ocean physical and chemical properties. The potential for carbon dioxide removal was explored across a range of observationally-informed carbon-to-nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios for microalgae and macroalgae communities, providing information on the sensitivity of the estimates to any assumed carbon-to-nutrient ratios. Simulated carbon dioxide removal across the tropical-to-subpolar ocean did not exceed 0.66 tons per square kilometer per year for microalgae, and did not exceed 0.85 tons per square kilometer per year for macroalgae. Using current technology, the estimated global aggregate potential for carbon dioxide removal using microalgae was less than 50 megatons (0.05 gigatons) of carbon dioxide annually and the estimated global aggregate potential for carbon dioxide removal using macroalgae was approximately 100 megatons (0.1 gigatons) of carbon dioxide annually. While controlled field trials are needed to validate or invalidate the findings of this study, this study suggests that artificial upwelling is unlikely to support annual carbon dioxide removal at, or close to, the rate of one gigaton of carbon dioxide annually.

NA	239167	2010.4663	Conservation management approaches to protecting the capacity for corals to respond to climate change: a theoretical comparison	Multiple anthropogenic impacts, including bleaching from climate change-related thermal stress, threaten coral reefs. Protecting coral capacity to respond to the increase in future thermal stress expected with climate change can involve (1) protecting coral reefs with characteristics indicative of greater resistance and resilience to climate change, and (2) reducing other anthropogenic impacts that are more likely to reduce coral resistance and resilience to climate change. Here, we quantitatively compare possible priorities and existing recommendations for protecting coral response capacity to climate change. Specifically, we explore the relative importance of the relevant dynamics, processes, and parameters in a size-structured model of coral and zooxanthellae ecological and evolutionary dynamics given projected future thermal stress. Model results with varying initial conditions indicate that protecting diverse coral communities is critical, and protecting communities with higher abundances of more thermally tolerant coral species and symbiont types secondary, to the long-term maintenance of coral cover. A sensitivity analysis of the coral population size in each size class and the total coral cover with respect to all parameter values suggests greater relative importance of reducing additional anthropogenic impacts that affect coral-macroalgal competition, early coral life history stages, and coral survivorship (compared with reproduction, growth, and shrinkage). Finally, model results with temperature trajectories from different locations, with and without connectivity, indicate that protection of, and connectivity to, low-thermal-stress locations may enhance the capacity for corals to respond to climate change.	coral bleaching; coral reefs; global climate change; quantitative genetic model; size-structured matrix model	2010	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	185169	2010.5352	Warming Seas in the Coral Triangle: Coral Reef Vulnerability and Management Implications	The highest diversity coral reefs in the world, located in the Coral Triangle, are threatened by a variety of local stresses including pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing in addition to climate change impacts, such as increasing sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and ocean acidification. As climate change impacts increase, coral reef vulnerability at the ecoregional scale will have an increasingly important influence on conservation management decisions. This project provides the first detailed assessment of past and future climatic stress, thermal variability, and anthropogenic impacts in the Coral Triangle at the ecoregional level, thus incorporating both local (e.g., pollution, development, and overfishing) and global threats (increasing SSTs). The development of marine protected area (MPA) networks across the Coral Triangle is critical for the region to address these threats. Specific management recommendations are defined for MPA networks based on the levels of vulnerability to thermal and local stress. For example, coral reef regions with potentially low vulnerability to thermal stress may be priorities for establishment of MPA networks, whereas high vulnerability regions may require selection and design principles aimed at building resilience to climate change. The identification of climate and other human threats to coral reef systems and ecoregions can help conservation practitioners prioritize management responses to address these threats and identify gaps in MPA networks or other management mechanisms (e. g., integrated coastal management).	coral triangle; climate change; coral reef; marine protected area (mpa); sea surface temperature (sst); management	2010	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	174967	2012.5232	Temperature-driven coral decline: the role of marine protected areas	Warming ocean temperatures are considered to be an important cause of the degradation of the world's coral reefs. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been proposed as one tool to increase coral reef ecosystem resistance and resilience (i.e. recovery) to the negative effects of climate change, yet few studies have evaluated their efficacy in achieving these goals. We used a high resolution 4 km global temperature anomaly database from 19852005 and 8040 live coral cover surveys on protected and unprotected reefs to determine whether or not MPAs have been effective in mitigating temperature-driven coral loss. Generally, protection in MPAs did not reduce the effect of warm temperature anomalies on coral cover declines. Shortcomings in MPA design, including size and placement, may have contributed to the lack of an MPA effect. Empirical studies suggest that corals that have been previously exposed to moderate levels of thermal stress have greater adaptive capacity and resistance to future thermal stress events. Existing MPAs protect relatively fewer reefs with moderate anomaly frequencies, potentially reducing their effectiveness. However, our results also suggest that the benefits from MPAs may not be great enough to offset the magnitude of losses from acute thermal stress events. Although MPAs are important conservation tools, their limitations in mitigating coral loss from acute thermal stress events suggest that they need to be complemented with policies aimed at reducing the activities responsible for climate change.	acclimation; climate change; conservation; coral; marine protected areas; resilience; resistance	2012	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	171005	2013.6633	Genotype - environment correlations in corals from the Great Barrier Reef	Background: Knowledge of genetic markers that are correlated to stress tolerance may improve spatial mapping of reef vulnerability and can inform restoration efforts, including the choice of genotypes for breeding and reseeding. In this manuscript we present two methods for screening transcriptome data for candidate genetic markers in two reef building corals, Acropora millepora and Pocillopora damicornis (types alpha and beta). In A. millepora, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were pre-selected by targeting genes believed to be involved in the coral thermal stress responses. In P. damicornis (type alpha and beta), SNPs showing varying allele frequencies between two populations from distinct environments were pre-selected. Allele frequencies at nine, five and eight of the pre-selected SNP loci were correlated against gradients of water clarity and temperature in a large number of populations along the Great Barrier Reef. Results: A significant correlation between environmental category and SNP allele frequency was detected in up to 55\% of the tested loci, which is an exceptional success rate for these types of tests. In P. damicornis, SNP allele frequencies of beta-hexosaminidase and Elongation factor 1-alpha were significantly correlated to temperature in type a and to temperature and/or water clarity respectively in type beta. Type alpha also showed a correlation between water clarity and SNP allele frequency in a gene of unknown function. In A. millepora, allele frequencies at five (beta-gamma crystallin, Galaxin, Ubiquitin, Ligand of Numb X2 and Thioredoxin) SNP loci showed significant correlations. Conclusions: After validation of these candidate loci through laboratory or field assessment of relative stress tolerance of colonies harbouring different alleles, it is anticipated that a proportion of these markers may represent the first coral candidate Quantitative Trait Loci for environmental stress tolerance and provide an important genetic tool that can be incorporated into spatial management decisions and restoration efforts of coral reefs. One pertinent example would be to combine spatial data of tolerant populations with genetic connectivity and thus identify high priority conservation reefs and implement targeted coral husbandry and active restoration efforts that use locally-and stress-adapted genotypes.	snp; pocillopora; acropora; coral; transcriptome; genotype-environment correlation	2013	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

NA	237009	2014.7767	Diverse coral communities in mangrove habitats suggest a novel refuge from climate change	Risk analyses indicate that more than 90\% of the world's reefs will be threatened by climate change and local anthropogenic impacts by the year 2030 under ``business-asusual{''} climate scenarios. Increasing temperatures and solar radiation cause coral bleaching that has resulted in extensive coral mortality. Increasing carbon dioxide reduces seawater pH, slows coral growth, and may cause loss of reef structure. Management strategies include establishment of marine protected areas with environmental conditions that promote reef resiliency. However, few resilient reefs have been identified, and resiliency factors are poorly defined. Here we characterize the first natural, non-reef coral refuge from thermal stress and ocean acidification and identify resiliency factors for mangrove-coral habitats. We measured diurnal and seasonal variations in temperature, salinity, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and seawater chemistry; characterized substrate parameters; and examined water circulation patterns in mangrove communities where scleractinian corals are growing attached to and under mangrove prop roots in Hurricane Hole, St. John, US Virgin Islands. Additionally, we inventoried the coral species and quantified incidences of coral bleaching, mortality, and recovery for two major reef-building corals, Colpophyllia natans and Diploria labyrinthiformis, growing in mangrove-shaded and exposed (unshaded) areas. Over 30 species of scleractinian corals were growing in association with mangroves. Corals were thriving in low-light (more than 70\% attenuation of incident PAR) from mangrove shading and at higher temperatures than nearby reef tract corals. A higher percentage of C. natans colonies were living shaded by mangroves, and no shaded colonies were bleached. Fewer D. labyrinthiformis colonies were shaded by mangroves, however more unshaded colonies were bleached. A combination of substrate and habitat heterogeneity, proximity of different habitat types, hydrographic conditions, and biological influences on seawater chemistry generate chemical conditions that buffer against ocean acidification. This previously undocumented refuge for corals provides evidence for adaptation of coastal organisms and ecosystem transition due to recent climate change. Identifying and protecting other natural, non-reef coral refuges is critical for sustaining corals and other reef species into the future.

NA	165945	2014.8024	An Ecosystem-Level Perspective on the Host and Symbiont Traits Needed to Mitigate Climate Change Impacts on Caribbean Coral Reefs	Caribbean reefs have steadily declined during the past 30 years. Thermal disturbances that elicit coral bleaching have been identified as a major driver of such coral degradation. It has been suggested that either the evolution of more tolerant symbionts, or shifts in the distribution of existing, tolerant symbionts could ameliorate the effect of rising sea temperatures on Caribbean reefs. Using a spatial ecosystem model we describe the characteristics that new tolerant symbionts, `super-symbionts', and their coral hosts, require for coral cover to be maintained. We also quantify the time necessary for such symbionts to become dominant before their potential beneficial effect is lost. Running scenarios under two levels of greenhouse gas emissions, we find that aggressive action to reduce emissions could almost triple the time available for new super-symbionts to become dominant and potentially mitigate the effect of thermal disturbances. The benefits of thermally tolerant super-symbionts depend on the life-history traits of the host, the number of coral species infected and the present coral assemblage. Corals that are strong competitors with macroalgae are likely to become dominant on future reefs if a super-symbiont appears in the next 25-60 years. In principle, super-symbionts could have ecosystem-level benefits in the Caribbean providing that they become dominant in multiple coral hosts with specific life-history traits within the next 60 years. This potential benefit would only be realized if the appearance of the super-symbiont is combined with drastic reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and maintenance of ecosystem processes such as herbivory.	coral reefs; ecosystem state; life history traits; climate change; thermal tolerance; symbiosis; ecosystem modeling	2014	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	9390	2015.651	Conservation Planning for Coral Reefs Accounting for Climate Warming Disturbances	Incorporating warming disturbances into the design of marine protected areas (MPAs) is fundamental to developing appropriate conservation actions that confer coral reef resilience. We propose an MPA design approach that includes spatially-and temporally-varying sea-surface temperature (SST) data, integrating both observed (1985-2009) and projected (2010-2099) time-series. We derived indices of acute (time under reduced ecosystem function following short-term events) and chronic thermal stress (rate of warming) and combined them to delineate thermal-stress regimes. Coral reefs located on the Brazilian coast were used as a case study because they are considered a conservation priority in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. We show that all coral reef areas in Brazil have experienced and are projected to continue to experience chronic warming, while acute events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity. We formulated quantitative conservation objectives for regimes of thermal stress. Based on these objectives, we then evaluated if/how they are achieved in existing Brazilian MPAs and identified priority areas where additional protection would reinforce resilience. Our results show that, although the current system of MPAs incorporates locations within some of our thermal-stress regimes, historical and future thermal refugia along the central coast are completely unprotected. Our approach is applicable to other marine ecosystems and adds to previous marine planning for climate change in two ways: (i) by demonstrating how to spatially configure MPAs that meet conservation objectives for warming disturbance using spatially-and temporally-explicit data; and (ii) by strategically allocating different forms of spatial management (MPA types) intended to mitigate warming impacts and also enhance future resistance to climate warming.

NA	259250	2017.14740	Well integrity for CO2 injection from ships: Simulation of the effect of flow and material parameters on thermal stresses	Ships have been shown to be the most cost-effective way to transport CO2 from many sources in the Nordic region to offshore storage sites. Injection from ships introduces new challenges for the integrity of CO2 injection wells. The low temperature and the intermittency of CO2 injected from ships give rise to large temperature variations in the well. Such variations may lead to thermal stresses that exceed the limits of the well construction method and materials. In this paper we present a coupled flow and heat conduction model for CO2 wells. The model is used to conduct a parameter study and determine the parametersâ€™ effect on the temperature variations in the well during injection from ships. The parameters varied are injection rate, injection time, injection temperature and time between injections. The resulting temperature variations are used as input for a 2D thermoelastic finite-element model in ABAQUS to determine the thermal stresses. Our results show that the amplitude of temperature variations downhole is mainly increased by longer pauses between injections, and by lower injection temperature. In the worst-case scenario considered in this paper, the thermal stresses may be large enough to induce debonding at the casingâ€“cement interface.

NA	233590	2017.8266	Environmental variability indicates a climate-adaptive center under threat in northern Mozambique coral reefs	A priority for modern conservation is finding and managing regions with environmental and biodiversity portfolio characteristics that will promote adaptation and the persistence of species during times of rapid climate change. The latitudinal edges of high-diversity biomes are likely to provide a mixture of environmental gradients and biological diversity that meet the portfolio criteria needed for adaptive systems. Northern Mozambique and the Quirimbas Islands represent the edge of a coral reef diversity center with limited potential to expand because of geologic and oceanographic limits on the southern edges. This region does, however, have the potential to be its own discrete adaptive center if it contains climate refugia and there are environmental gradients that promote acclimatization, ecological reorganization, and natural selection. Consequently, to evaluate this potential we tested for strong regional environmental spatial heterogeneity that might indicate a climate-adaptive center. Additionally, we evaluated human influences and environmental and demographic data on finfish, coral, and sea urchins in 66 reefs across similar to 4 degrees of latitude to evaluate ecological changes and human threats. A number of clear gradients in environmental and human influences were observed. For example, temperature increased and became more centralized and right-skewed, while water quality decreased to the south. Coral communities susceptible to thermal stress were found in the north where dispersed temperatures indicated a location with either tolerance to or refugium from recent thermal disturbances. Nevertheless, high coral diversity was found in southern deep-water channels. Further, spatial patterns for corals and fish differed indicating complex geographic-fishing-biodiversity gradients. Consequently, environmental conditions for an adaptive portfolio exist and include refugia for preserving climate-sensitive and for numbers of coral taxa. Fishing and urban threats were observable as reduced fish biomass, diversity, and body sizes but higher biomass of sea urchins. We observed that many remote and protected areas had fish biomass values lower than expected or near maximum sustainable yields. This indicates low compliance and widespread migratory fishing, which is reducing fish diversity below maximum levels. Recommendations to sustain this adaptive center are to maintain fish biomass >500 kg/ha by increasing fisheries restrictions and compliance.	africa; climate refugia; environmental gradients; fishing impacts; latitudinal limits	2017	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Caused mainly by abnormally high sea surface temperature, coral bleaching has significant effects on marine resources. Using panel data from Indonesia and exogenous variations in bleaching, I observe that fishery households in affected areas experienced a decrease in income relative to other households. Although consumption expenditures did not decline significantly in response to these income shocks, these households reduced their protein consumption in the short and long runs. Regarding labor market outcomes, the affected households tended to substantially increase their labor supply and switch industries only in the long run.	coral bleaching; long-term income shock; labor supply; consumption; climate change	2019	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	1758	2019.192	Coral reefs of the Red Sea - Challenges and potential solutions	The Red Sea is a unique body of water, hosting some of the most productive and diverse coral reefs. Human populations along coasts of the Red Sea were initially sparse due to the hot and arid climate surrounding it, but this is changing with improved desalination techniques, accessible energy, and increased economic interest in coastal areas. In addition to increasing pressure on reefs from coastal development, global drivers, primarily ocean acidification and seawater warming, are threatening coral reefs of the region. While reefs in southern sections of the Red Sea live near or above their maximum temperature tolerance and have experienced bleaching events in the recent past, coral reefs in northern sections are considered a coral reef refugia from global warming and acidification, at least for the coming decades. Such differential sensitivities along the latitudinal gradient of the Red Sea require differential solutions and management. In an effort to identify the appropriate solutions to conserve and maintain resilience of these reefs along a latitudinal gradient, we used a SWOT analysis ( strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats) to frame the present situation and to propose policy solutions as useful planning procedures. We highlight the need for immediate action to secure the northern sections of the Red Sea as a coral reef climate change refuge by management and removal of local stressors. There is a need to strengthen the scientific knowledge base for proper management and to encourage regional collaboration on environmental issues. Based on scientific data, solutions such as marine protected areas, fishing regulation, and reef restoration approaches were ranked for five distinct latitudinal sections in the Red Sea and levels of interventions are recommended.

NA	46785	2019.3721	Restoring the flat oyster Ostrea angasi in the face of a changing climate	Across the globe, restoration efforts are stemming the loss of native oyster reefs and the ecosystem services they provide, but these efforts will need to consider climate change in order to be sustainable. South-eastern Australia is the focus of restoring the once abundant oyster Ostrea angasi. This region is also a climate change `hot spot' where the ocean is warming rapidly, with the potential to be exacerbated by marine heatwaves and coastal acidification. In this study, the impact of near-future (similar to 2050) elevated temperature and pCO(2) on O. angasi was determined and considered in context with concerns for the long-term sustainability of oyster reef restoration efforts. Oysters were exposed to ambient and elevated pCO(2) concentrations (mean +/- SE: 408 +/- 19.8 and 1070 +/- 53.4 mu atm) and ambient and elevated temperatures (22.78 +/- 0.17 and 25.73 +/- 0.21 degrees C) for 10 wk in outdoor flow-through mesocosms. Shell growth, condition index, standard metabolic rate (SMR), extracellular pH and survival were measured. Elevated temperature caused high mortality (36 \%) and decreased the condition of oysters (33 \%). Elevated pCO(2) increased SMR almost 4-fold and lowered the extracellular pH of O. angasi by a mean 0.29 pH units. In combination, elevated pCO(2) and temperature ameliorated effects on SMR and survivorship of oysters. O. angasi appears to be living near the limits of its thermal tolerance. Restoration projects will need to account for the temperature sensitivity of this species and its changing habitat to `climate proof' long-term restoration efforts.	reef restoration; ostrea angasi; ocean warming; ocean acidification; climate change; flat oysters; aquaculture; physiology	2019	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	5835	2019.614	Prioritizing reef resilience through spatial planning following a mass coral bleaching event	Following the recent 2014-2017 global coral bleaching event, managers are seeking interventions to promote long-term resilience beyond monitoring coral decline. Here, we applied a spatial approach to investigate one potential intervention, mapping areas where local management could build coral reef resilience using herbivore management. Although herbivore management is a top recommendation in resilience-based management, site-specific attributes are thought to affect its success, and thus strategizing placement and design of these areas are crucial. Using Marxan, we mapped and prioritized potential Herbivore Management Areas (HMAs), where herbivores are protected but other types of fishing are allowed, in the main Hawaiian Islands. Through four scenarios, we found multiple hotspots along the west coast of Hawai'i Island and around the islands of Moloka'i, Lana'i, Maui, and Kaho'olawe where HMAs may have the best chance for success based on habitat, ecologically critical areas, life history, and social considerations. We further analyzed top results and found that a subset of characteristics including habitat types, biomass of herbivore functional groups, and temperature variability were significantly different from surrounding areas and thus contain potential drivers for selection. This unique approach can serve as an example for coral reef management in Hawai'i, on other Pacific Islands, and beyond, as it provides practical guidance on how to apply a resilience-building tool at a local level, incorporating site-specific biological and socioeconomic considerations.	coral bleaching; reef resilience; marine spatial planning; herbivore management; marxan	2019	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
NA	189574	2020.14794	Depth Affects Seagrass Restoration Success and Resilience to Marine Heat Wave Disturbance	Accelerating losses of seagrass meadows motivate the restoration of these highly productive and beneficial ecosystems. Understanding how environmental parameters including depth and temperature affect restoration trajectories through time is key to conserving and restoring seagrass meadows. We used a long-term (12-year), landscape-scale experiment to test the effect of depth on eelgrass (Zostera marina) restoration success and resilience to a marine heat wave (MHW) disturbance. We found that depth was a critical determinant of seagrass restoration success, with no long-term success at sites deeper than 1.5 m below mean sea level (MSL) or shallower than - 0.8 m MSL. Seeds germinated below - 1.5 m MSL, but shoots did not persist, confirming earlier predictions from a hydrodynamic-vegetation model. Depth was also a significant predictor of seagrass resilience following MHW disturbance. Our results suggest that areas of restored seagrass that are resilient to temperature stress exist across an intermediate depth range, excluding the shallowest and deepest portions of the full habitable depth range for restored seagrass. Over the next decades, sea-level rise will likely affect both the habitable area and the resilient area, available for seagrass restoration. However, seagrass enhancement of sediment accretion may at least partially offset sea-level rise rates. As ocean temperatures warm and MHWs occur more frequently, the resilience of seagrass meadows to temperature stress will be of increasing concern. These results suggest that depth is a critical parameter that will help determine what areas are most resilient and therefore most suitable for conservation and restoration.	restoration; seagrass; zostera marina; marine heat wave; depth limit	2020	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	43667	2020.3983	Modeling Coral Bleaching Mitigation Potential of Water Vertical Translocation - An Analogue to Geoengineered Artificial Upwelling	Artificial upwelling (AU) is a novel geoengineering technology that brings seawater from the deep ocean to the surface. Within the context of global warming, AU techniques are proposed to reduce sea surface temperature at times of thermal stress around coral reefs. A computationally fast but coarse 3D Earth System model (3.6 degrees longitude x 1.8 degrees latitude) was used to investigate the environmental impacts of hypothetically implemented AU strategies in the Great Barrier Reef, South China Sea, and Hawaiian regions. While omitting the discussion on sub-grid hydrology, we simulated in our model a water translocation from either 130 or 550 m depth to sea surface at rates of 1 or 50 m(3) s(-1) as analogs to AU implementation. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 emissions scenario from year 2020 on, the model predicted a prevention of coral bleaching until the year 2099 when AU was implemented, except under the least intense AU scenario (water from 130 m depth at 1 m(3) s(-1)). Yet, intense AU implementation (water from 550 m depth at 50 m(3) s(-1)) will likely have adverse effects on coral reefs by overcooling the surface water, altering salinity, decreasing calcium carbonate saturation, and considerably increasing nutrient levels. Our result suggests that if we utilize AU for mitigating coral bleaching during heat stress, AU implementation needs to be carefully designed with respect to AU's location, depth, intensity and duration so that undesirable environmental effects are minimized. Following a proper installation and management procedure, however, AU has the potential to decelerate destructive bleaching events and buy corals more time to adjust to climate change.	coral bleaching; ocean biogeochemical modeling; artificial upwelling; global warming; sea surface temperature rise; heat waves; earth system modeling	2020	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	301484	2020.4715	Optimising cool-water injections to reduce thermal stress on coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef	Coral bleaching driven by ocean warming is one of the most visible ecological impacts of climate change and perhaps the greatest threat to the persistence of reefs in the coming decades. In the absence of returning atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations to those compatible with ocean temperatures below the mass coral bleaching temperature thresholds, the most straightforward means to reduce thermal-stress induced bleaching is to cool water at the seabed. The feasibility of reducing the seabed temperature through cool-water injections is considered first by analysing the feasibility of doing so on 19 reefs with differing physical environments using a simple residence time metric in 200 m resolution hydrodynamic model configurations. We then concentrate on the reefs around Lizard Island, the most promising candidate of the 19 locations, and develop a 40 m hydrodynamic model to investigate the effect of the injection of cool water at differing volumetric rates. Injecting 27Â°C seawater at a rate of 5 m3 s-1 at 4 sites in early 2017 cooled 97 ha of the reef by 0.15Â°C or more. The power required to pump 5 m3 s-1 through a set of pipes over a distance of 3 km from a nearby channel is 466 kW. This power applied at 4 sites for 3 months achieves a 2 Degree Heating Weeks (DHWs) reduction on 97 ha of reef. A more precise energy costing will require further expert engineering design of the pumping equipment and energy sources. Even for the most physically favourable reefs, cool-water transported through pipes and injected at a reef site is energy expensive and cannot be scaled up to any meaningful fraction of the 3,100 reefs of the GBR. Should priority be given to reducing thermal stress on one or a few high value reefs, this paper provides a framework to identify the most promising sites. Copyright: Â© 2020 Baird et al.

The notion that adaptive traits can be retained by transferring the symbionts alone, however, challenges the holobiont concept, a fundamental paradigm in coral research. Holobiont traits are products of a specific community (holobiont) and all its co-evolutionary and local adaptations, which might limit the retention or transference of holobiont traits by exchanging only one partner. Here we evaluate how interchanging partners affect the short- and long-term performance of holobionts under heat stress using clonal lineages of the cnidarian model system Aiptasia (host and Symbiodiniaceae strains) originating from distinct thermal environments. Our results show that holobionts from more thermally variable environments have higher plasticity to heat stress, but this resilience could not be transferred to other host genotypes through the exchange of symbionts. Importantly, our findings highlight the role of the host in determining holobiont productivity in response to thermal stress and indicate that local adaptations of holobionts will likely limit the efficacy of interchanging unfamiliar compartments to enhance thermal tolerance.	adaptation; climate change; coral reefs; exaiptasia pallida; heat stress; photosynthesis; respiration; symbiodiniaceae; symportal	2020	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Strategies for acute events included development and implementation of programs and practices for monitoring and treating mental health problems and strengthening individual and community resilience, training of community health workers to deliver services, and conducting inventories of available resources and assessments of at-risk populations. Additional strategies for sub-acute changes included advocacy for mitigation policies and programs and adaptation of guidelines and interventions to address the secondary impacts of sub-acute events, such as threats to livelihood, health and well-being, population displacement, environmental degradation, and civil conflict. Strategies for long-lasting changes included the implementation of evidence-based risk communication interventions that address the existing and potential threat of climate change, promoting the mental health benefits of environmental conservation, and promoting psychological growth and resilience.

NA	8641	2021.1144	Large-scale interventions may delay decline of the Great Barrier Reef	On the iconic Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the cumulative impacts of tropical cyclones, marine heatwaves and regular outbreaks of coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS) have severely depleted coral cover. Climate change will further exacerbate this situation over the coming decades unless effective interventions are implemented. Evaluating the efficacy of alternative interventions in a complex system experiencing major cumulative impacts can only be achieved through a systems modelling approach. We have evaluated combinations of interventions using a coral reef meta-community model. The model consisted of a dynamic network of 3753 reefs supporting communities of corals and CoTS connected through ocean larval dispersal, and exposed to changing regimes of tropical cyclones, flood plumes, marine heatwaves and ocean acidification. Interventions included reducing flood plume impacts, expanding control of CoTS populations, stabilizing coral rubble, managing solar radiation and introducing heat-tolerant coral strains. Without intervention, all climate scenarios resulted in precipitous declines in GBR coral cover over the next 50 years. The most effective strategies in delaying decline were combinations that protected coral from both predation (CoTS control) and thermal stress (solar radiation management) deployed at large scale. Successful implementation could expand opportunities for climate action, natural adaptation and socioeconomic adjustment by at least one to two decades.	coral reef; great barrier reef; climate adaptation; climate impacts; coral bleaching; meta-community model	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	123910	2021.13828	Real-Time Environmental Monitoring for Aquaculture Using a LoRaWAN-Based IoT Sensor Network	IoT-enabled devices are making it easier and cheaper than ever to capture in situ environmental data and deliver these data-in the form of graphical visualisations-to farmers in a matter of seconds. In this work we describe an aquaculture focused environmental monitoring network consisting of LoRaWAN-enabled atmospheric and marine sensors attached to buoys on Clyde River, located on the South Coast of New South Wales, Australia. This sensor network provides oyster farmers operating on the river with the capacity to make informed, accurate and rapid decisions that enhance their ability to respond to adverse environmental events-typically flooding and heat waves. The system represents an end-to-end approach that involves deploying a sensor network, analysing the data, creating visualisations in collaboration with farmers and delivering them to them in real-time via a website known as FarmDecisionTECH (R). We compared this network with previously available infrastructure, the results of which demonstrate that an in situ weather station was \& SIM;5 \& LCIRC;C hotter than the closest available real-time weather station (\& SIM;20 km away from Clyde River) during a summertime heat wave. Heat waves can result in oysters dying due to exposure if temperatures rise above 30 \& LCIRC;C for extended periods of time (such as heat waves), which will mean a loss in income for the farmers; thus, this work stresses the need for accurate in situ monitoring to prevent the loss of oysters through informed farm management practices. Finally, an approach is proposed to present high-dimensional datasets captured from the sensor network to oyster farmers in a clear and informative manner.	lorawan; iot; aquaculture; environment; monitoring	2021	Devi	NA	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
NA	188911	2021.16072	Technology requirements, and social impacts of technology for at-scale coral reef restoration	The coral reefs of the world are in decline as a result of local and global stressors. Significant impacts are caused by ocean heat waves associated with increasing ocean temperatures as the oceans accommodate more and more of the heat produced as a result of the global emissions of greenhouse gases. In response, a global reef restoration sector is emerging with the aspiration to restore many of the worlds' reefs and increase their resilience to climate change and other stressors. However, the scale of the challenge is vast, and will realistically only be achieved through the development and application of new marine technology including for environmental surveillance and monitoring, material transfer (corals and coral rubble), new more resilient varieties of corals and the underpinning required data analytics. In addition, most reefs are located in low-income nations, including Small Island Nations and the level of complexity and ease of use of technologies being developed will dictate who can participate in at-scale restoration of the world's reefs, and correspondingly may lead to considerable social distributional impacts as some communities will be able to utilise emerging technologies whilst others may not.	reef restoration; marine technology; social impacts of technology; restoration technology	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	19050	2021.2318	Seagrass Recovery Following Marine Heat Wave Influences Sediment Carbon Stocks	Worldwide, seagrass meadows accumulate significant stocks of organic carbon (C), known as ``blue{''} carbon, which can remain buried for decades to centuries. However, when seagrass meadows are disturbed, these C stocks may be remineralized, leading to significant CO2 emissions. Increasing ocean temperatures, and increasing frequency and severity of heat waves, threaten seagrass meadows and their sediment blue C. To date, no study has directly measured the impact of seagrass declines from high temperatures on sediment C stocks. Here, we use a long-term record of sediment C stocks from a 7-km2, restored eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadow to show that seagrass dieback following a single marine heat wave (MHW) led to significant losses of sediment C. Patterns of sediment C loss and re-accumulation lagged patterns of seagrass recovery. Sediment C losses were concentrated within the central area of the meadow, where sites experienced extreme shoot density declines of 90\% during the MHW and net losses of 20\% of sediment C over the following 3 years. However, this effect was not uniform; outer meadow sites showed little evidence of shoot declines during the MHW and had net increases of 60\% of sediment C over the following 3 years. Overall, sites with higher seagrass recovery maintained 1.7x as much C compared to sites with lower recovery. Our study demonstrates that while seagrass blue C is vulnerable to MHWs, localization of seagrass loss can prevent meadow-wide C losses. Long-term (decadal and beyond) stability of seagrass blue C depends on seagrass resilience to short-term disturbance events.	zostera marina; eelgrass; disturbance; marine heat wave; blue carbon; restoration; resilience; climate change	2021	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	41592	2021.4184	Priming of Marine Macrophytes for Enhanced Restoration Success and Food Security in Future Oceans	Marine macrophytes, including seagrasses and macroalgae, form the basis of diverse and productive coastal ecosystems that deliver important ecosystem services. Moreover, western countries increasingly recognize macroalgae, traditionally cultivated in Asia, as targets for a new bio-economy that can be both economically profitable and environmentally sustainable. However, seagrass meadows and macroalgal forests are threatened by a variety of anthropogenic stressors. Most notably, rising temperatures and marine heatwaves are already devastating these ecosystems around the globe, and are likely to compromise profitability and production security of macroalgal farming in the near future. Recent studies show that seagrass and macroalgae can become less susceptible to heat events once they have been primed with heat stress. Priming is a common technique in crop agriculture in which plants acquire a stress memory that enhances performance under a second stress exposure. Molecular mechanisms underlying thermal priming are likely to include epigenetic mechanisms that switch state and permanently trigger stress-preventive genes after the first stress exposure. Priming may have considerable potential for both ecosystem restoration and macroalgae farming to immediately improve performance and stress resistance and, thus, to enhance restoration success and production security under environmental challenges. However, priming methodology cannot be simply transferred from terrestrial crops to marine macrophytes. We present first insights into the formation of stress memories in both seagrasses and macroalgae, and research gaps that need to be filled before priming can be established as new bio-engineering technique in these ecologically and economically important marine primary producers.	dna methylation; plasticity; stress memory; bio-engineering; seagrass; macroalgae farming; kelp restoration; heat hardening	2021	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	11977	2022.1652	Larval thermal conditioning does not improve post-settlement thermal tolerance in the dominant reef-building coral, Montipora capitata	Climate change-induced ocean warming has reshaped reef ecosystems as coral bleaching events continue to lead to mass coral die-offs globally. These thermal anomalies also negatively affect reef persistence and recovery when heat stress events continue to occur during critical reproduction and recruitment periods. As a result, recruitment (settlement and survival of early life stages) continues to decline on reefs globally, compromising the recovery of reef systems following mass bleaching and mortality events, which has led to the loss of ecological function on these reefs. One mitigation strategy within the active restoration framework includes propagated corals (i.e., adult fragments, larvae, or juveniles) produced in nurseries that are then directly out planted to the reef benthos. Restoration programs can greatly benefit from use of sexually derived coral propagules, which when optimized, increase the scalability and genetic diversity of outplanted stock. Thermal conditioning during larval rearing has the potential to be a cost-effective and scalable strategy to enhance the survival and stress tolerance of subsequent life stages. Here, we tested the potential for thermal conditioning during the larval stage to induce positive latent effects on the stress tolerance of Montipora capitata spat. We exposed larvae to cool (24.5 degrees C), ambient (27.2 degrees C), and warm (28.9 degrees C) conditions for four days and during this period we tracked larval survival. Following thermal conditioning during the larval stage, we measured settlement success and then exposed spat to a 47-day high temperature stress (+ 2 degrees C) and measured survival. We found that larval thermal conditioning did not provide survival benefits to spat under elevated temperature. Furthermore, larval exposure to temperatures outside of an ambient regime compromised survival, suggesting that although positive latent effects were not observed here in spat, optimizing thermal conditions is important for maximizing survival and settlement of coral larvae.	early life history; bleaching; latent effects; larvae; spat; coral reef	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	285152	2022.21401	Effect of marine heat waves on carbon metabolism, optical characterization, and bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon in coastal vegetated communities	Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays an essential role in the global marine carbon cycle, with coastal vegetated communities as important DOC producers. However, the ultimate fate of this DOC remains still largely unknown due to the lack of knowledge about its chemical composition and lability. Furthermore, global change could alter both DOC fluxes and its bioavailability, affecting the carbon sequestration capacity of coastal vegetated communities. This study explores, in two contrasting seasons (winter and summer), the effects of an in situ simulated marine heatwave on carbon metabolism and DOC fluxes produced by seagrass (Cymodocea nodosa) and macroalgae (Caulerpa prolifera) communities. In addition, the fluorescent characteristics and biodegradability of the dissolved organic matter released directly by the communities under such conditions are evaluated. Under marine heatwave conditions, a significant increase in net community production (NCP) in C. nodosa and a shift to negative DOC fluxes in C. prolifera were observed. In control treatments, the seagrass-dominated community produced a substantial amount of labile (between 44% and 58%) and recalcitrant DOC (between 42% and 56%), while C. prolifera community produced mainly recalcitrant DOC (between 64% and 87%). Therefore, this research revealed that temperature is an important factor determining the NCP in benthic communities and the chemical structure and bioavailability of DOC produced by these communities, since both communities tended to produce more humic-like and less bioavailable DOC with increasing temperature.

Shading the reef, through seawater atomised fogging, is one tool in development to reduce levels of irradiance and temperature. To evaluate the potential viability of this concept, here we review 91 years (1930-2021) of published research looking at the effects of different levels of shade and light on coral reefs. We summarised the types of studies, places, coral species used, common responses variable measured, and types of shades used among studies. We discuss issues related to reef scale shading applicability, different methods used to measure light, standardisation methods and most importantly the positive and negative effects of shading corals.	irradiance; ultraviolet radiation; visible light; shading; fogging; cloud brightening; reef restoration; climate change	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	61777	2022.6276	A role for bacterial experimental evolution in coral bleaching mitigation?	Coral reefs are rapidly declining because of widespread mass coral bleaching causing extensive coral mortality. Elevated seawater temperatures are the main drivers of coral bleaching, and climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of destructive marine heatwaves. Efforts to enhance coral thermal bleaching tolerance can be targeted at the coral host or at coral-associated microorganisms (e.g., dinoflagellate endosymbionts and bacteria). The literature on experimental evolution of bacteria suggests that it has value as a tool to increase coral climate resilience. We provide a workflow on how to experimentally evolve coral-associated bacteria to confer thermal tolerance to coral hosts and emphasize the value of implementing this approach in coral reef conservation and restoration efforts.

NA	101782	2022.8582	Marine protected areas do not buffer corals from bleaching under global warming	Background The rising temperature of the oceans has been identified as the primary driver of mass coral reef declines via coral bleaching (expulsion of photosynthetic endosymbionts). Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been implemented throughout the oceans with the aim of mitigating the impact of local stressors, enhancing fish biomass, and sustaining biodiversity overall. In coral reef regions specifically, protection from local stressors and the enhanced ecosystem function contributed by MPAs are expected to increase coral resistance to global-scale stressors such as marine heatwaves. However, MPAs still suffer from limitations in design, or fail to be adequately enforced, potentially reducing their intended efficacy. Here, we address the hypothesis that the local-scale benefits resulting from MPAs moderate coral bleaching under global warming related stress. Results Bayesian analyses reveal that bleaching is expected to occur in both larger and older MPAs when corals are under thermal stress from marine heatwaves (quantified as Degree Heating Weeks, DHW), but this is partially moderated in comparison to the effects of DHW alone. Further analyses failed to identify differences in bleaching prevalence in MPAs relative to non-MPAs for coral reefs experiencing different levels of thermal stress. Finally, no difference in temperatures where bleaching occurs between MPA and non-MPA sites was found. Conclusions Our findings suggest that bleaching is likely to occur under global warming regardless of protected status. Thus, while protected areas have key roles for maintaining ecosystem function and local livelihoods, combatting the source of global warming remains the best way to prevent the decline of coral reefs via coral bleaching.	antagonistic; anthropocene; climate change; coral reefs; degradation; local stressors; mpa; scleractinia	2022	Devi	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	268028	2022.917	Exploring microbiome engineering as a strategy for improved thermal tolerance in Exaiptasia diaphana	Aims: Fourteen percent of all living coral, equivalent to more than all the coral on the Great Barrier Reef, has died in the past decade as a result of climate change-driven bleaching. Inspired by the â€˜oxidative stress theory of coral bleachingâ€™, we investigated whether a bacterial consortium designed to scavenge free radicals could integrate into the host microbiome and improve thermal tolerance of the coral model, Exaiptasia diaphana. Methods and Results: E. diaphana anemones were inoculated with a consortium of high free radical scavenging (FRS) bacteria, a consortium of congeneric low FRS bacteria, or sterile seawater as a control, then exposed to elevated temperature. Increases in the relative abundance of Labrenzia during the first 2Â weeks following the last inoculation provided evidence for temporary inoculum integration into the E. diaphana microbiome. Initial uptake of other consortium members was inconsistent, and these bacteria did not persist either in E. diaphanaâ€™s microbiome over time. Given their non-integration into the host microbiome, the ability of the FRS consortium to mitigate thermal stress could not be assessed. Importantly, there were no physiological impacts (negative or positive) of the bacterial inoculations on the holobiont. Conclusions: The introduced bacteria were not maintained in the anemone microbiome over time, thus, their protective effect is unknown. Achieving long-term integration of bacteria into cnidarian microbiomes remains a research priority. Significance and Impact of the Study: Microbiome engineering strategies to mitigate coral bleaching may assist coral reefs in their persistence until climate change has been curbed. This study provides insights that will inform microbiome manipulation approaches in coral bleaching mitigation research. Â© 2022 The Authors.

NA	56785	2012.2290	A comparative global assessment of potential negative emissions technologies	The paper summarises a global assessment of around 30 prospective negative emissions techniques (NETs) found in the literature. Fourteen techniques including direct air capture, BECCS, biochar, and ocean alkalinity enhancement are considered in more detail. The novel functional categorisation of NETs developed in the course of the assessment is set out and a comparative quantitative summary of the results is presented, focusing on the relative readiness, global capacity, costs and side-effects of the prospective NETs. Both technology specific and more generic potential limitations are discussed, notably those arising from energy requirements, from availability of geological storage capacity and from sustainable supply of biomass. Conclusions are drawn regarding the overall scope of NETs to contribute to safe carbon budgets, and challenges arising in the future governance of NETs, with particular reference to the potential role of carbon markets.

NA	270107	2013.2715	Assessing the potential of calcium-based artificial ocean alkalinization to mitigate rising atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidification	Enhancement of ocean alkalinity using calcium compounds, e.g., lime has been proposed to mitigate further increase of atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidification due to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Using a global model, we show that such alkalinization has the potential to preserve pH and the saturation state of carbonate minerals at close to today's values. Effects of alkalinization persist after termination: Atmospheric CO2 and pH do not return to unmitigated levels. Only scenarios in which large amounts of alkalinity (i.e., in a ratio of 2:1 with respect to emitted CO 2) are added over large ocean areas can boost oceanic CO2 uptake sufficiently to avoid further ocean acidification on the global scale, thereby elevating some key biogeochemical parameters, e.g., pH significantly above preindustrial levels. Smaller-scale alkalinization could counteract ocean acidification on a subregional or even local scale, e.g., in upwelling systems. The decrease of atmospheric CO2 would then be a small side effect.

Addition of 114 Pmol of alkalinity to the surface ocean stabilizes atmospheric CO2 concentration to RCP4.5 levels under RCP8.5 emissions. This scenario removes 940 GtC from the atmosphere and mitigates 1.5 K of global warming within this century. The climate adjusts to the lower CO2 concentration preventing the loss of sea ice and high sea level rise. Seawater pH and the carbonate saturation state (Î©) rise substantially above levels of the current decade. Pronounced differences in regional sensitivities to AOA are projected, with the Arctic Ocean and tropical oceans emerging as hot spots for biogeochemical changes induced by AOA. Thus, the CO2 mitigation potential of AOA comes at a price of an unprecedented ocean biogeochemistry perturbation with unknown ecological consequences. Â©2016. American Geophysical Union.

NA	258082	2017.4100	Model-Based Assessment of the CO2 Sequestration Potential of Coastal Ocean Alkalinization	The potential of coastal ocean alkalinization (COA), a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) climate engineering strategy that chemically increases ocean carbon uptake and storage, is investigated with an Earth system model of intermediate complexity. The CDR potential and possible environmental side effects are estimated for various COA deployment scenarios, assuming olivine as the alkalinity source in ice-free coastal waters (about 8.6% of the global ocean's surface area), with dissolution rates being a function of grain size, ambient seawater temperature, and pH. Our results indicate that for a large-enough olivine deployment of small-enough grain sizes (10 Âµm), atmospheric CO2 could be reduced by more than 800 GtC by the year 2100. However, COA with coarse olivine grains (1000 Âµm) has little CO2 sequestration potential on this time scale. Ambitious CDR with fine olivine grains would increase coastal aragonite saturation Î© to levels well beyond those that are currently observed. When imposing upper limits for aragonite saturation levels (Î©lim) in the grid boxes subject to COA (Î©lim = 3.4 and 9 chosen as examples), COA still has the potential to reduce atmospheric CO2 by 265 GtC (Î©lim = 3.4) to 790 GtC (Î©lim = 9) and increase ocean carbon storage by 290 Gt (Î©lim = 3.4) to 913 Gt (Î©lim = 9) by year 2100.

NA	14324	2018.1400	Quantifying and Comparing Effects of Climate Engineering Methods on the Earth System	To contribute to a quantitative comparison of climate engineering (CE) methods, we assess atmosphere-, ocean-, and land-based CE measures with respect to Earth system effects consistently within one comprehensive model. We use the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) with prognostic carbon cycle to compare solar radiation management (SRM) by stratospheric sulfur injection and two carbon dioxide removal methods: afforestation and ocean alkalinization. The CE model experiments are designed to offset the effect of fossil-fuel burning on global mean surface air temperature under the RCP8.5 scenario to follow or get closer to the RCP4.5 scenario. Our results show the importance of feedbacks in the CE effects. For example, as a response to SRM the land carbon uptake is enhanced by 92Gt by the year 2100 compared to the reference RCP8.5 scenario due to reduced soil respiration thus reducing atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, we show that normalizations allow for a better comparability of different CE methods. For example, we find that due to compensating processes such as biogeophysical effects of afforestation more carbon needs to be removed from the atmosphere by afforestation than by alkalinization to reach the same global warming reduction. Overall, we illustrate how different CE methods affect the components of the Earth system; we identify challenges arising in a CE comparison, and thereby contribute to developing a framework for a comparative assessment of CE.	climate engineering; geoengineering; solar radiation management; carbon dioxide removal; earth system modelling; carbon cycle	2018	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	256702	2018.4287	Potential ecotoxicological effects of elevated bicarbonate ion concentrations on marine organisms	Recently, a novel method for carbon capture and storage has been proposed, which converts gaseous CO2 into aqueous bicarbonate ions (HCO3âˆ’), allowing it to be deposited into the ocean. This alkalinization method could be used to dispose large amounts of CO2 without acidifying seawater pH, but there is no information on the potential adverse effects of consequently elevated HCO3âˆ’ concentrations on marine organisms. In this study, we evaluated the ecotoxicological effects of elevated concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (max 193 mM) on 10 marine organisms. We found species-specific ecotoxicological effects of elevated DIC on marine organisms, with EC50-DIC (causing 50% inhibition) of 11â€“85 mM. The tentative criteria for protecting 80% of individuals of marine organisms are suggested to be pH 7.8 and 11 mM DIC, based on acidification data previously documented and alkalinization data newly obtained from this study. Overall, the results of this study are useful for providing baseline information on ecotoxicological effects of elevated DIC on marine organisms. More complementary studies are needed on the alkalinization method to determine DIC effects on seawater chemistry and marine organisms. â€œMarine organisms could be affected by elevated concentrations of bicarbonate ions in seawater produced via the alkalinization method.â€ Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd	acidification;  carbon capture;  carbon dioxide;  digital storage;  ions;  marine biology;  ph, alkalinization;  aqueous bicarbonates;  bicarbonate;  dissolved inorganic carbon;  ecotoxicological effects;  elevated concentrations;  ion concentrations;  seawater chemistry, seawater effects, bicarbonate;  dissolved inorganic carbon;  unclassified drug;  acid;  bicarbonate;  carbon;  carbon dioxide;  sea water, alkalinization;  bicarbonate;  bioaccumulation;  dissolved inorganic carbon;  ecotoxicology;  ion;  ocean acidification;  ph;  pollution effect, acidification;  alkalinization;  article;  ecotoxicity;  ecotoxicology;  marine species;  nonhuman;  ph;  sea;  aquatic species;  chemistry;  ecotoxicology;  physiology;  toxicity;  water pollutant, acids;  aquatic organisms;  bicarbonates;  carbon;  carbon dioxide;  ecotoxicology;  hydrogen-ion concentration;  seawater;  water pollutants, chemical	2018	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	58672	2018.4415	Enhanced Rates of Regional Warming and Ocean Acidification After Termination of Large-Scale Ocean Alkalinization	Termination effects of large-scale artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) have received little attention because AOA was assumed to pose low environmental risk. With the Max Planck Institute Earth system model, we use emission-driven AOA simulations following the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5). We find that after termination of AOA warming trends in regions of the Northern Hemisphere become similar to 50\% higher than those in RCP8.5 with rates similar to those caused by termination of solar geoengineering over the following three decades after cessation (up to 0.15K/year). Rates of ocean acidification after termination of AOA outpace those in RCP8.5. In warm shallow regions where vulnerable coral reefs are located, decreasing trends in surface pH double (0.01 units/year) and the drop in the carbonate saturation state (Omega) becomes up to 1 order of magnitude larger (0.2 units/year). Thus, termination of AOA poses higher risks to biological systems sensitive to fast-paced environmental changes than previously thought. Plain Language Summary Climate engineering (CE) methods are intended to alleviate the environmental perturbations caused by climate change and ocean acidification. However, these methods can also lead to environmental issues. Among all the different CE techniques, the method of artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) is commonly discussed. AOA involves the release of processed alkaline minerals into the ocean, which enhances the uptake of atmospheric carbon by the ocean while reducing the acidification of seawater. We study the impacts caused by the termination of AOA on environmental properties that are relevant for organisms and ecosystems because they are sensitive not only to the magnitude of environmental change but also to its pace. We analyze the rate at which the environment changes after termination of this method using an Earth system model that simulates the response of our climate to CE. We found that the abrupt termination of large-scale implementation of AOA leads to regional rates of surface warming and ocean acidification, which largely exceed the pace of change that the implementation of AOA was intended to alleviate. This enhanced rate of environmental change would restrict even more the already limited adaptive capacity of vulnerable organisms and ecosystems.

NA	60416	2018.4521	The Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (CDRMIP): rationale and experimental protocol for CMIP6	The recent IPCC reports state that continued anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are changing the climate, threatening ``severe, pervasive and irreversible{''} impacts. Slow progress in emissions reduction to mitigate climate change is resulting in increased attention to what is called geoengineering, climate engineering, or climate intervention - deliberate interventions to counter climate change that seek to either modify the Earth's radiation budget or remove greenhouse gases such as CO2 from the atmosphere. When focused on CO2, the latter of these categories is called carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Future emission scenarios that stay well below 2 degrees C, and all emission scenarios that do not exceed 1.5 degrees C warming by the year 2100, require some form of CDR. At present, there is little consensus on the climate impacts and atmospheric CO2 reduction efficacy of the different types of proposed CDR. To address this need, the Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (or CDRMIP) was initiated. This project brings together models of the Earth system in a common framework to explore the potential, impacts, and challenges of CDR. Here, we describe the first set of CDRMIP experiments, which are formally part of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). These experiments are designed to address questions concerning CDR-induced climate ``reversibility{'' the response of the Earth system to direct atmospheric CO2 removal (direct air capture and storage), and the CDR potential and impacts of afforestation and reforestation, as well as ocean alkalinization.

NA	305263	2019.17709	CO2 Removal With Enhanced Weathering and Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement: Potential Risks and Co-benefits for Marine Pelagic Ecosystems	Humankind will need to remove hundreds of gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere by the end of the twenty-first century to keep global warming below 2Â°C within the constraints of the global carbon budget. However, so far it is unclear if and how this could be achieved. A widely recognized idea is to accelerate weathering reactions of minerals that consume CO2 when they dissolve. Acceleration could be realized by pulverizing and distributing gigatons of these minerals onto land (termed â€œenhanced weathering (EW)â€) or sea (termed â€œocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE)â€) thereby largely increasing their reactive surfaces. However, the desired consumption of atmospheric CO2 during dissolution would inevitably be accompanied by a release of mineral dissolution products (alkalinity, Si, Ca, Mg, Fe, Ni, and maybe others). Here, we approximate their maximum additions to assess potential consequences for pelagic communities (mainly primary producers) and the biogeochemical fluxes they control. Based on this assessment, we tentatively qualify the potential to induce positive and/or negative side effects to be high for Fe, Ni, Si, intermediate for alkalinity, and low for Ca and Mg. However, perturbation potentials are always higher at perturbation hotspots and would be different for EW than for OAE. Furthermore, ecological/biogeochemical consequences of EW/OAE largely depend on the minerals used. We hypothesize that mainly calcifiers would profit in a scheme where CaCO3 derivatives would be used due to beneficial changes in carbonate chemistry. Figuratively, this may turn the blue ocean into a white(r) ocean. When using silicates, the release of additional Si, Fe and Ni could benefit silicifiers and N2-fixers (cyanobacteria) and increase ocean productivity ultimately turning the blue ocean into a green(er) ocean. These considerations call for dedicated research to assess risks and co-benefits of mineral dissolution products on marine and other environments. Indeed, both EW and OAE could become important tools to realize CO2 removal at the planetary scale but associated risks and/or co-benefits should be revealed before deciding on their implementation.

NA	25130	2019.2236	The potential environmental response to increasing ocean alkalinity for negative emissions	The negative emissions technology, artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA), aims to store atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean by increasing total alkalinity (TA). Calcium carbonate saturation state (Omega CaCO3) and pH would also increase meaning that AOA could alleviate sensitive regions and ecosystems from ocean acidification. However, AOA could raise pH and Omega CaCO3 well above modern-day levels, and very little is known about the environmental and biological impact of this. After treating a red calcifying algae (Corallina spp.) to elevated TA seawater, carbonate production increased by 60\% over a control. This has implication for carbon cycling in the past, but also constrains the environmental impact and efficiency of AOA. Carbonate production could reduce the efficiency of CO2 removal. Increasing TA, however, did not significantly influence Corallina spp. primary productivity, respiration, or photophysiology. These results show that AOA may not be intrinsically detrimental for Corallina spp. and that AOA has the potential to lessen the impacts of ocean acidification. However, the experiment tested a single species within a controlled environment to constrain a specific unknown, the rate change of calcification, and additional work is required to understand the impact of AOA on other organisms, whole ecosystems, and the global carbon cycle.	ocean alkalinity; corallina spp; calcification; carbon dioxide removal; artificial ocean alkalinization	2019	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	301024	2020.18856	Anthropogenic CO2 of High Emission Scenario Compensated After 3500 Years of Ocean Alkalinization With an Annually Constant Dissolution of 5 Pg of Olivine	The CO2 removal model inter-comparison (CDRMIP) has been established to approximate the usefulness of climate mitigation by some well-defined negative emission technologies. I here analyze ocean alkalinization in a high CO2 world (emission scenario SSP5-85-EXT++ and CDR-ocean-alk within CDRMIP) for the next millennia using a revised version of the carbon cycle model BICYCLE, whose long-term feedbacks are calculated for the next 1 million years. The applied model version not only captures atmosphere, ocean, and a constant marine and terrestrial biosphere, but also represents solid Earth processes, such as deep ocean CaCO3 accumulation and dissolution, volcanic CO2 outgassing, and continental weathering. In the applied negative emission experiment, 0.14 Pmol/yr of alkalinityâ€”comparable to the dissolution of 5 Pg of olivine per yearâ€”is entering the surface ocean starting in year 2020 for either 50 or 5000 years. I find that the cumulative emissions of 6,740 PgC emitted until year 2350 lead to a peak atmospheric CO2 concentration of nearly 2,400 ppm in year 2326, which is reduced by only 200 ppm by the alkalinization experiment. Atmospheric CO2 is brought down to 400 or 300 ppm after 2730 or 3480 years of alkalinization, respectively. Such low CO2 concentrations are reached without ocean alkalinization only after several hundreds of thousands of years, when the feedbacks from weathering and sediments bring the part of the anthropogenic emissions that stays in the atmosphere (the so-called airborne fraction) below 4%. The efficiency of carbon sequestration by this alkalinization approach peaks at 9.7 PgC per Pmol of alkalinity added during times of maximum anthropogenic CO2 emissions and slowly declines to half this value 2000 years later due to the non-linear marine chemistry response and ocean-sediment processes. In other words, ocean alkalinization sequesters carbon only as long as the added alkalinity stays in the ocean. To understand the basic model behavior, I analytically explain why in the simulation results a linear relationship in the transient climate response (TCR) to cumulative emissions is found for low emissions (similarly as for more complex climate models), which evolves for high emissions to a non-linear relation.

NA	296921	2021.20581	The Sensitivity of the Marine Carbonate System to Regional Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement	Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) simultaneously mitigates atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and ocean acidification; however, no previous studies have investigated the response of the non-linear marine carbonate system sensitivity to alkalinity enhancement on regional scales. We hypothesise that regional implementations of OAE can sequester more atmospheric CO2 than a global implementation. To address this, we investigate physical regimes and alkalinity sensitivity as drivers of the carbon-uptake potential response to global and different regional simulations of OAE. In this idealised ocean-only set-up, total alkalinity is enhanced at a rate of 0.25 Pmol a-1 in 75-year simulations using the Max Planck Institute Ocean Model coupled to the HAMburg Ocean Carbon Cycle model with pre-industrial atmospheric forcing. Alkalinity is enhanced globally and in eight regions: the Subpolar and Subtropical Atlantic and Pacific gyres, the Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean. This study reveals that regional alkalinity enhancement has the capacity to exceed carbon uptake by global OAE. We find that 82â€“175 Pg more carbon is sequestered into the ocean when alkalinity is enhanced regionally and 156 PgC when enhanced globally, compared with the background-state. The Southern Ocean application is most efficient, sequestering 12% more carbon than the Global experiment despite OAE being applied across a surface area 40 times smaller. For the first time, we find that different carbon-uptake potentials are driven by the surface pattern of total alkalinity redistributed by physical regimes across areas of different carbon-uptake efficiencies. We also show that, while the marine carbonate system becomes less sensitive to alkalinity enhancement in all experiments globally, regional responses to enhanced alkalinity vary depending upon the background concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity. Furthermore, the Subpolar North Atlantic displays a previously unexpected alkalinity sensitivity increase in response to high total alkalinity concentrations.

Their role in revising UNFCCC Parties' future Nationally Determined Contributions is discussed in the broad context of ocean-based actions for both mitigation and ecological adaptation. All measures are clustered in three policy-relevant categories (Decisive, Low Regret, Concept Stage). None of the ocean-based NETs assessed are identified as Decisive at this stage. One is Low Regret (Restoring and increasing coastal vegetation), and three are at Concept Stage, one with low to moderate potential disbenefits (Marine bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) and two with potentially high disbenefits (Enhancing open-ocean productivity and Enhancing weathering and alkalinization). Ocean-based NETs are uncertain but potentially highly effective. They have high priority for research and development. Copyright Â© 2021 Gattuso, Williamson, Duarte and Magnan.

NA	300360	2021.21395	Alkalinization Scenarios in the Mediterranean Sea for Efficient Removal of Atmospheric CO2 and the Mitigation of Ocean Acidification	It is now widely recognized that in order to reach the target of limiting global warming to well below 2Â°C above pre-industrial levels (as the objective of the Paris agreement), cutting the carbon emissions even at an unprecedented pace will not be sufficient, but there is the need for development and implementation of active Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategies. Among the CDR strategies that currently exist, relatively few studies have assessed the mitigation capacity of ocean-based Negative Emission Technologies (NET) and the feasibility of their implementation on a larger scale to support efficient implementation strategies of CDR. This study investigates the case of ocean alkalinization, which has the additional potential of contrasting the ongoing acidification resulting from increased uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the seas. More specifically, we present an analysis of marine alkalinization applied to the Mediterranean Sea taking into consideration the regional characteristics of the basin. Rather than using idealized spatially homogenous scenarios of alkalinization as done in previous studies, which are practically hard to implement, we use a set of numerical simulations of alkalinization based on current shipping routes to quantitatively assess the alkalinization efficiency via a coupled physical-biogeochemical model (NEMO-BFM) for the Mediterranean Sea at 1/16Â° horizontal resolution (~6 km) under an RCP4.5 scenario over the next decades. Simulations suggest the potential of nearly doubling the carbon-dioxide uptake rate of the Mediterranean Sea after 30 years of alkalinization, and of neutralizing the mean surface acidification trend of the baseline scenario without alkalinization over the same time span. These levels are achieved via two different alkalinization strategies that are technically feasible using the current network of cargo and tanker ships: a first approach applying annual discharge of 200 Mt Ca(OH)2 constant over the alkalinization period and a second approach with gradually increasing discharge proportional to the surface pH trend of the baseline scenario, reaching similar amounts of annual discharge by the end of the alkalinization period. We demonstrate that the latter approach allows to stabilize the mean surface pH at present day values and substantially increase the potential to counteract acidification relative to the alkalinity added, while the carbon uptake efficiency (mole of CO2 absorbed by the ocean per mole of alkalinity added) is only marginally reduced. Nevertheless, significant local alterations of the surface pH persist, calling for an investigation of the physiological and ecological implications of the extent of these alterations to the carbonate system in the short to medium term in order to support a safe, sustainable application of this CDR implementation.

NA	61061	2021.5963	Techno-economic and environmental feasibility of mineral carbonation technology for carbon neutrality: A Perspective	Although various CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) technologies are being researched and developed intensively for the purpose of lowering greenhouse gas emissions, most current technologies remain at low technology readiness levels for industrial use and are less economical compared to conventional processes. Mineral carbonation is a CO2 utilization technology with low net CO2 emissions and high CO2 reduction potential, and various commercialization studies are underway around the world. This manuscript reviews the potential of mineral carbonation as a general CCU technology and the techno-economic and environmental feasibility of a representative technology, which produces sodium bicarbonate through the saline water electrolysis and carbonation steps, and examines the potential CO2 reduction derived from the application of this technology. The future implementation of mineral carbonation technology in ocean alkalinity enhancement for sequestrating atmospheric CO2 or the production of abandoned mine backfill materials is also discussed in order to deploy the technology at much larger scales for a meaningful contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.	carbon capture and utilization; mineral carbonation; co2 reduction; economic evaluation	2021	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	11187	2022.1543	Response of a Coastal Microbial Community to Olivine Addition in the Muping Marine Ranch, Yantai	Spreading olivine powder in seawater to enhance alkalinity through weathering reactions has been proposed as a potential solution to control atmospheric CO2 concentration. Attention has usually been paid to the chemical properties of seawater after the addition of olivine within lab and modeling studies. However, both microbial acclimation and evolution in such manipulated natural environments are often overlooked, yet they are of great importance for understanding the biological consequences of whether olivine addition is a feasible approach to mitigating climate change. In this study, an olivine addition experiment was conducted to investigate variation in bacterial diversity and community composition in the surface and bottom seawater of a representative marine ranch area in the Muping, Yantai. The results show that the composition of the particle-attached microbial community was particularly affected by the application of olivine. The relative abundance of biofilm-forming microbes in particle-attached fraction increased after the addition of olivine, while no significant variation in the free-living bacterial community was observed. Our study suggests that olivine addition would reshape the bacterial community structure, especially in particle-attached microenvironments. Therefore, the risk evaluation of alkalinity enhancement should be further studied before its large-scale application as a potential ocean geoengineering plan.	co2 sequestration; silicate mineral dissolution; seawater alkalinity; enhanced weathering; bacterial community	2022	Devi	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
NA	267413	2022.1950	Harvesting, storing, and converting carbon from the ocean to create a new carbon economy: Challenges and opportunities	Ever-increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions have required us to develop carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies, and in order to address climate change, these options should be at scale. In addition to engineered systems of CO2 capture from power plants and chemical processes, there are emerging approaches that include the Earth (i.e., air, Earth, and ocean) within its system boundary. Since oceans constitute the largest natural sink of CO2, technologies that can enhance carbon storage in the ocean are highly desired. Here, we discuss alkalinity enhancement and biologically inspired CO2 hydration reactions that can shift the equilibrium of ocean water to pump more carbon into this natural sink. Further, we highlight recent work that can harvest and convert CO2 captured by the ocean into chemicals, fuels, and materials using renewable energy such as off-shore wind. Through these emerging and innovative technologies, organic and inorganic carbon from ocean-based solutions can replace fossil-derived carbon and create a new carbon economy. It is critical to develop these ocean-based CCUS technologies without unintended environmental or ecological consequences, which will create a new engineered carbon cycle that is in harmony with the Earthâ€™s system.

NA	14775	2022.2020	Ocean alkalinity enhancement - avoiding runaway CaCO3 precipitation during quick and hydrated lime dissolution	Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a method that can remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and counteract ocean acidification through the dissolution of alkaline minerals. Currently, critical knowledge gaps exist regarding the dissolution of different minerals suitable for OAE in natural seawater. Of particular importance is to understand how much alkaline mineral can be dissolved before secondary precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) occurs, since secondary CaCO3 precipitation reduces the atmospheric CO2 uptake potential of OAE. Using two types of mineral proposed for OAE, quick lime (CaO) and hydrated lime (Ca(OH)(2)), we show that both (<63 mu m of diameter) dissolved in seawater within a few hours. No CaCO3 precipitation occurred at a saturation state (Omega(A)) of similar to 5, but CaCO3 precipitation in the form of aragonite occurred above an Omega(A) value of 7. This limit is lower than expected for typical pseudo-homogeneous precipitation, i.e. in the presence of colloids and organic matter. Secondary precipitation at low Omega(A) ( similar to 7) was the result of heterogeneous precipitation onto mineral surfaces, most likely onto the added CaO and Ca(OH)(2) particles. Most importantly, runaway CaCO3 precipitation was observed, a condition where significantly more total alkalinity (TA) was removed than initially added. Such runaway precipitation could reduce the OAE CO2 uptake efficiency from similar to 0.8 mol of CO2 per mole of added TA down to 0.1 mol of CO2 per mole of TA. Runaway precipitation appears to be avoidable by dilution below the critical Omega(A) threshold of 5, ideally within hours of the mineral additions to minimise initial CaCO3 precipitation. Finally, OAE simulations suggest that for the same Omega(A) threshold, the amount of TA that can be added to seawater would be more than 3 times higher at 5 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. The maximum TA addition could also be increased by equilibrating the seawater to atmospheric CO2 levels (i.e. to a pCO(2) of similar to 416 mu atm) during addition. This would allow for more TA to be added in seawater without inducing CaCO3 precipitation, using OAE at its CO2 removal potential.

NA	251995	2022.20329	The efficacy of enhancing carbonate weathering for carbon dioxide sequestration	Enhanced weathering is a geoengineering strategy aiming to increase continental weathering rates, thereby increasing the delivery of atmospheric carbon (as (Formula presented.) ) to the oceans. Most enhanced weathering studies focus on the capacity of silicate rocks (e.g., basalt) and minerals (e.g., olivine, Mg2SiO4, or wollastonite CaSiO3) to remove atmospheric CO2. However, carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite, CaCO3) could provide an additional, rapid way to increase (Formula presented.) export to the oceans. Recent studies suggest that 0.84 Gt C yrâˆ’1 could be removed from the atmosphere through the enhanced dissolution of calcite in soils, provided carbonic acid is the main dissolution agent. What is not clear is whether atmospheric CO2 dissolved in soils can be transported by rivers, which typically have lower [pCO2], to the oceans. This difference in calcite solubility between soils (where weathering occurs) and rivers (where (Formula presented.) is transported) may lead to large amounts of secondary carbonate formation during transport, releasing the CO2 consumed through dissolution. Here, we present a modeling study comparing the estimated soil dissolution capacity (SDC) in 149 of Earth's largest river basins, to the potential transport capacity of carbon (PTCC) in corresponding rivers. We find the SDC can only be exported to the oceans, without secondary carbonate precipitation, if rivers are in disequilibrium with respect to calcite (i.e., SIc = 1). In this instance, 0.92 Gt C yrâˆ’1 may be sequestered above background weathering rates, which is ~20% of annual increases in atmospheric carbon. If rivers are at equilibrium with calcite (i.e., SIc = 0), approximately two-thirds of the carbon dissolved in soil waters are lost due to calcite precipitation in rivers, and just 0.26 Gt of additional atmospheric C yrâˆ’1 can be transported to the oceans. Overall, the efficacy of enhanced carbonate weathering is a function of the capacity rivers have for transporting the products from carbonate weathering to the oceans, rather than the dissolution capacity of soils. These findings have implications for the efficiency of enhancing silicate weathering for ocean alkalinity enhancement, as secondary carbonate precipitation during transport is not always considered.

NA	252096	2022.20355	Microbial ecosystem responses to alkalinity enhancement in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre	In addition to reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, actively removing CO2 from the atmosphere is widely considered necessary to keep global warming well below 2Â°C. Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) describes a suite of such CO2 removal processes that all involve enhancing the buffering capacity of seawater. In theory, OAE both stores carbon and offsets ocean acidification. In practice, the response of the marine biogeochemical system to OAE must be demonstrably negligible, or at least manageable, before it can be deployed at scale. We tested the OAE response of two natural seawater mixed layer microbial communities in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, one at the Western gyre boundary, and one in the middle of the gyre. We conducted 4-day microcosm incubation experiments at sea, spiked with three increasing amounts of alkaline sodium salts and a 13C-bicarbonate tracer at constant pCO2. We then measured a suite of dissolved and particulate parameters to constrain the chemical and biological response to these additions. Microbial communities demonstrated occasionally measurable, but mostly negligible, responses to alkalinity enhancement. Neither site showed a significant increase in biologically produced CaCO3, even at extreme alkalinity loadings of +2,000 Î¼mol kgâˆ’1. At the gyre boundary, alkalinity enhancement did not significantly impact net primary production rates. In contrast, net primary production in the central gyre decreased by ~30% in response to alkalinity enhancement. The central gyre incubations demonstrated a shift toward smaller particle size classes, suggesting that OAE may impact community composition and/or aggregation/disaggregation processes. In terms of chemical effects, we identify equilibration of seawater pCO2, inorganic CaCO3 precipitation, and immediate effects during mixing of alkaline solutions with seawater, as important considerations for developing experimental OAE methodologies, and for practical OAE deployment. These initial results underscore the importance of performing more studies of OAE in diverse marine environments, and the need to investigate the coupling between OAE, inorganic processes, and microbial community composition.

NA	252203	2022.20371	Geochemical Negative Emissions Technologies: Part I. Review	Over the previous two decades, a diverse array of geochemical negative emissions technologies (NETs) have been proposed, which use alkaline minerals for removing and permanently storing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Geochemical NETs include CO2 mineralization (methods which react alkaline minerals with CO2, producing solid carbonate minerals), enhanced weathering (dispersing alkaline minerals in the environment for CO2 drawdown) and ocean alkalinity enhancement (manipulation of ocean chemistry to remove CO2 from air as dissolved inorganic carbon). CO2 mineralization approaches include in situ (CO2 reacts with alkaline minerals in the Earth's subsurface), surficial (high surface area alkaline minerals found at the Earth's surface are reacted with air or CO2-bearing fluids), and ex situ (high surface area alkaline minerals are transported to sites of concentrated CO2 production). Geochemical NETS may also include an approach to direct air capture (DAC) that harnesses surficial mineralization reactions to remove CO2 from air, and produce concentrated CO2. Overall, these technologies are at an early stage of development with just a few subjected to field trials. In Part I of this work we have reviewed the current state of geochemical NETs, highlighting key features (mineral resources; processes; kinetics; storage durability; synergies with other NETs such as DAC, risks; limitations; co-benefits, environmental impacts and life-cycle assessment). The role of organisms and biological mechanisms in enhancing geochemical NETs is also explored. In Part II, a roadmap is presented to help catalyze the research, development, and deployment of geochemical NETs at the gigaton scale over the coming decades.

NA	267023	2022.20777	Assessing the influence of ocean alkalinity enhancement on a coastal phytoplankton community	Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a proposed method to counteract climate change by increasing the alkalinity of the surface ocean and thus the chemical storage capacity of seawater for atmospheric CO2. The impact of OAE on marine ecosystems, including phytoplankton communities which make up the base of the marine food web, is largely unknown. To investigate the influence of OAE on phytoplankton communities, we enclosed a natural plankton community from coastal Tasmania for 22gÂ¯d in nine microcosms during a spring bloom. Microcosms were split into three groups, (1) the unperturbed control, (2) the unequilibrated treatment where alkalinity was increased (+495gÂ¯Â±gÂ¯5.2gÂ¯Î¼molgÂ¯kg-1) but seawater CO2 was not in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2, and (3) the equilibrated treatment where alkalinity was increased (+500gÂ¯Â±gÂ¯3.2gÂ¯Î¼molgÂ¯kg-1) and seawater CO2 was in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. Both treatments have the capacity to increase the inorganic carbon sink of seawater by 21gÂ¯%. We found that simulated OAE had significant but generally moderate effects on various groups in the phytoplankton community and on heterotrophic bacteria. More pronounced effects were observed for the diatom community where silicic acid drawdown and biogenic silica build-up were reduced at increased alkalinity. Observed changes in phytoplankton communities affected the temporal trends of key biogeochemical parameters such as the organic matter carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. Interestingly, the unequilibrated treatment did not have a noticeably larger impact on the phytoplankton (and heterotrophic bacteria) community than the equilibrated treatment, even though the changes in carbonate chemistry conditions were much more severe. This was particularly evident from the occurrence and peak of the phytoplankton spring bloom during the experiment, which was not noticeably different from the control. Altogether, the inadvertent effects of increased alkalinity on the coastal phytoplankton communities appear to be rather limited relative to the enormous climatic benefit of increasing the inorganic carbon sink of seawater by 21gÂ¯%. We note, however, that more detailed and widespread investigations of plankton community responses to OAE are required to confirm or dismiss this first impression.

NA	19883	2022.2472	Investigating the effect of nickel concentration on phytoplankton growth to assess potential side-effects of ocean alkalinity enhancement	Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a proposed method for removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere by the accelerated weathering of (ultra-)basic minerals to increase alkalinity - the chemical capacity of seawater to store CO2. During the weathering of OAE-relevant minerals relatively large amounts of trace metals will be released and may perturb pelagic ecosystems. Nickel (Ni) is of particular concern as it is abundant in olivine, one of the most widely considered minerals for OAE. However, so far there is limited knowledge about the impact of Ni on marine biota including phytoplankton. To fill this knowledge gap, this study tested the growth and photo-physiological response of 11 marine phytoplankton species to a wide range of dissolved Ni concentrations (from 0.07 to 50 000 nmol L-1). We found that the phytoplankton species were not very sensitive to Ni concentrations under the culturing conditions established in our experiments, but the responses were species-specific. The growth rates of 6 of the 11 tested species showed generally limited but still significant responses to changing Ni concentrations (36 \% maximum change). Photosynthetic performance, assessed by measuring the maximum quantum yield (F-v /F-m) and the functional absorption cross-section (sigma(PSII)) of photosystem II (PSII), was sensitive to changing Ni in 3 out of 11 species (35 \% maximum change) and 4 out of 11 species (16 \% maximum change), respectively. The limited effect of Ni may be partly due to the provision of nitrate as the nitrogen source for growth as previous studies suggest higher sensitivities when urea is the nitrogen source. Furthermore, the limited influence may be due to the relatively high concentrations of synthetic organic ligands added to the growth media in our experiments. These ligands are commonly added to control trace metal bioavailability and therefore for example ``free Ni2+{''} concentrations by binding the majority of the dissolved Ni. Our data suggest that dissolved Ni does not have a strong effect on phytoplankton under our experimental conditions, but we emphasize that a deeper understanding of nitrogen sources, ligand concentrations, and phytoplankton composition is needed when assessing the influence of Ni release associated with OAE.

NA	252344	2022.2982	Use of aircraft in ocean alkalinity enhancement	Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) is a proposed Negative Emissions Technology (NET) to remove atmospheric CO2 through the dispersion of alkaline materials (e.g.: calcium hydroxide, slaked lime, SL) into seawater, simultaneously counteracting ocean acidification. This study considers aircraft discharge of SL and its consequent dry deposition, extending to the marine environment a technique used in freshwater. A feasibility analysis assesses potential, costs, benefits, and disadvantages, considering scenarios with different assumptions on aircraft size, discharge height and duration, and wind conditions. Due to the small size of SL particles (median diameter 9 Î¼m), the dispersion from aircraft is highly enhanced by wind drift; the smallest SL particles may drift thousands of kilometres, especially if discharged from elevated altitudes. This could pose problems related to powders particles settling on remote lands. Although calcium hydroxide maximum concentration into water (from 0.01 to 82 mg Lâˆ’1) is for almost all the scenarios lower than the most stringent threshold for the ecosystem impacts on a 96-h exposure, the ecologically sensitive sea surface microlayer (SML) should be considered in detail. The high CO2 emissions of the Landing to Take-Off Cycle (LTO) of the aircraft and their limited payload lead to a significant CO2 penalty, ranging in analysed scenarios between 28% and 77% of the CO2 removal potential; very fast discharge could reduce the penalty to 11% - 32%. Preliminary cost analysis shows that the cost of the SL discharge through aircraft is high, between â‚¬ 30 and â‚¬ 1846 per ton of CO2 removed (neglecting the lime cost), substantially higher than the cost for discharge by surface vessels resulting from previous studies, which restricts the practical use of this strategy.

NA	284688	2022.4772	The Availability of Limestone and Other Raw Materials for Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement	The work assesses the availability and localizations of different raw materials suitable for ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE), like limestone, olivine, magnesite and brucite, since several billion tons of rocky materials are needed to achieve meaningful results for carbon sequestration through OAE. Resources of carbonates are immense and widespread around all continents. Availability of pure carbonates is still very large (outcrop area 4.1 million km2) and is not a constraint for the large-scale development of OAE. Outcrops of pure carbonates within 10Â km from the coastline and below bare ground or scrub/shrub, preferred for the logistics of exploitation, account for about 70,000Â km2, and could provide about 5,000Â Gt of limestone. These values increase by a factor of 3 and 8 within 50 and 100Â km from the coastline, respectively. Potential resources of olivine, less easily identifiable from the geological data, are estimated in the order of a few hundred billion tons and could provide only a minor contribution to ocean-based carbon removal strategies. A comparison with the current level of world extraction of mineral raw materials is also provided. The annual production of limestone, estimated to be more than 6.6Â Gt from deposits scattered all around the world, is about 9% of the world production of mineral raw materials (around 44Â Gt yrâˆ’1), and is of the same order of magnitude as coal (7.3Â Gt yrâˆ’1).

NA	267435	2022.5684	The Carbon-Capture Efficiency of Natural Water Alkalinization: Implications For Enhanced weathering	Enhanced weathering (EW) is a promising negative-emission technology that artificially accelerates the dissolution of natural minerals, promotes biomass growth, and alleviates the acidification of soils and natural waters. EW aims to increase the alkalinity of natural waters (alkalinization) to promote a transfer of CO2 from the atmosphere to the water. Here we provide a quantification of the alkalinization carbon-capture efficiency (ACE) as a function of the water chemistry. ACE can be used for any alkaline mineral in various natural waters. We show that ACE strongly depends on the water pH, with a sharp transition from minimum to maximum in a narrow interval of pH values. We also quantify ACE in three compartments of the land-to-ocean aquatic continuum: the world topsoils, the lakes of an acid-sensitive area, and the global surface ocean. The results reveal that the efficiency of terrestrial EW varies markedly, from 0 to 100 %, with a significant trade-off in acidic conditions between carbon-capture efficiency and enhanced chemical dissolution. The efficiency is more stable in the ocean, with a typical value of around 80 % and a latitudinal pattern driven by differences in seawater temperature and salinity. Our results point to the importance of an integrated hydrological and biogeochemical theory to assess the fate of the weathering products across the aquatic continuum from land to ocean.

NA	268434	2022.6101	Ocean-Based Carbon Dioxide Removal: A New Frontier in the Blue Economy	The ocean is a key facet of climate stability and Earthâ€™s carbon cycle. Given the immense scale of atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR) necessary to achieve international climate goals, ocean-based CDR approaches (or â€œocean CDRâ€) warrant serious consideration. Ocean CDR is a still nascent, but cautiously promising, area of scientific research with several approaches under evaluation. Here, we examine one of the most promising approaches, ocean alkalinity enhancement, to highlight and exemplify challenges and opportunities of an emerging ocean CDR industry in the blue economy.

NA	306566	2023.2984	Potential capture and conversion of CO2 from oceanwater through mineral carbonation	Carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by human activities not only brings about a serious greenhouse effect but also accelerates global climate change. This has resulted in extreme climate hazards that can obstruct human development in the near future. Hence, there is an urgent need to achieve carbon neutrality by increasing negative emissions. The ocean plays a vital role in absorbing and sequestering CO2. Current research on marine carbon storage and sink enhancement mainly focuses on biological carbon sequestration using carbon sinks (macroalgae, shellfish, and fisheries). However, seawater inorganic carbon accounts for more than 95 % of the total carbon in marine carbon storage. Increasing total alkalinity at a constant dissolved inorganic carbon shifts the balance of existing seawater carbonate system and prompts a greater absorption of atmospheric CO2, thereby increasing the ocean's â€œcarbon sinkâ€. This review explores two main mechanisms (i.e., enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization) and materials (e.g., silicate rocks, metal oxides, and metal hydroxides) that regulate marine chemical carbon sink (MCCS). This work also compares MCCS with other terrestrial and marine carbon sinks and discusses the implementation of MCCS, including the following aspects: chemical reaction rate, cost, and possible ecological and environmental impacts.

NA	306569	2023.2987	Geochemical carbon dioxide removal potential of Spain	Many countries have made pledges to reduce CO2 emissions over the upcoming decades to meet the Paris Agreement targets of limiting warming to no &gt;1.5 Â°C, aiming for net zero by mid-century. To achieve national reduction targets, there is a further need for CO2 removal (CDR) approaches on a scale of millions of tonnes, necessitating a better understanding of feasible methods. One approach that is gaining attention is geochemical CDR, encompassing (1) in-situ injection of CO2-rich gases into Ca and Mg-rich rocks for geological storage by mineral carbonation, (2) ex-situ ocean alkalinity enhancement, enhanced weathering and mineral carbonation of alkaline-rich materials, and (3) electrochemical separation processes. In this context, Spain may host a notionally high geochemical CDR capacity thanks to its varied geological setting, including extensive mafic-ultramafic and carbonate rocks. However, pilot schemes and large-scale strategies for CDR implementation are presently absent in-country, partly due to gaps in current knowledge and lack of attention paid by regulatory bodies. Here, we identify possible materials, localities and avenues for future geochemical CDR research and implementation strategies within Spain. This study highlights the kilotonne to million tonne scale CDR options for Spain over the rest of the century, with attention paid to chemically and mineralogically appropriate materials, suitable implementation sites and potential strategies that could be followed. Mafic, ultramafic and carbonate rocks, mine tailings, fly ashes, slag by-products, desalination brines and ceramic wastes hosted and produced in Spain are of key interest, with industrial, agricultural and coastal areas providing opportunities to launch pilot schemes. Though there are obstacles to reaching the maximum CDR potential, this study helps to identify focused targets that will facilitate overcoming such barriers. The CDR potential of Spain warrants dedicated investigations to achieve the highest possible CDR to make valuable contributions to national reduction targets.

NA	58034	2023.701	Limits and CO2 equilibration of near-coast alkalinity enhancement	Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) has recently gained attention as a potential method for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) at gigatonne (Gt) scale, with near-coast OAE operations being economically favorable due to proximity to mineral and energy sources. In this paper we study critical questions which determine the scale and viability of OAE. Which coastal locations are able to sustain a large flux of alkalinity at minimal pH and omega(Arag )(aragonite saturation) changes? What is the interference distance between adjacent OAE projects? How much CO2 is absorbed per unit of alkalinity added? How quickly does the induced CO2 deficiency equilibrate with the atmosphere? Choosing relatively conservative constraints on delta pH or delta Omega, we examine the limits of OAE using the ECCO LLC270 (0.3 degrees) global circulation model. We find that the sustainable OAE rate varies over 1-2 orders of magnitude between different coasts and exhibits complex patterns and non-local dependencies which vary from region to region. In general, OAE in areas of strong coastal currents enables the largest fluxes and depending on the direction of these currents, neighboring OAE sites can exhibit dependencies as far as 400 km or more. At these steady state fluxes most regional stretches of coastline are able to accommodate on the order of 10s to 100s of megatonnes of negative emissions within 300 km of the coast. We conclude that near-coastal OAE has the potential to scale globally to several Gt CO2 yr(-1) of drawdown with conservative pH constraints, if the effort is spread over the majority of available coastlines. Depending on the location, we find a diverse set of equilibration kinetics, determined by the interplay of gas exchange and surface residence time. Most locations reach an uptake efficiency plateau of 0.6-0.8 mol CO2 per mol of alkalinity after 3-4 years, after which there is only slow additional CO2 uptake. Regions of significant downwelling (e.g., around Iceland) should be avoided by OAE deployments, as in such locations up to half of the CDR potential of OAE can be lost to bottom waters. The most ideal locations, reaching a molar uptake ratio of around 0.8, include North Madagascar, California, Brazil, Peru and locations close to the Southern Ocean such as Tasmania, Kerguelen and Patagonia, where the gas exchange appears to occur faster than the surface residence time. However, some locations (e.g., Hawaii) take significantly longer to equilibrate (up to 8-10 years) but can still eventually achieve high uptake ratios.
