"What is the level of incentivisation required for biomethane upgrading technologies with carbon capture and reuse?","Rajendran, Karthik and Browne, James D. and Murphy, Jerry D.","2019","Renewable Energy","This paper documents a techno-economic assessment of biomethane feedstocks from urban, rural, and coastal settings. Additionally, the effect of three upgrading technologies was investigated, ranging from commercialised systems (water scrubbing) to more advanced systems: power to gas systems employing hydrogen to capture CO2; and microalgae cultivation utilising CO2 in biogas. In total, nine scenarios were investigated based on a combination of the three feedstock groups and the three upgrading technologies. The levelized cost of energy and the incentive required to allow financial sustainability were assessed. The assessment showed that water scrubbing was the cheapest upgrading method. The optimum scenario was the combination of urban based feedstock (food waste) with water scrubbing upgrading costing 87(sic)/MWh, equivalent to 87c/L. diesel equivalent. The incentive required was 0.13 (sic)/m(3) (or per L of diesel equivalent), however if power to gas was used to upgrade, an incentive of 0.40 (sic)/m(3) was required. This was expected as food waste attracts a gate fee. Rural-based plants (using slurries and grasses) are expected to provide the majority of the resource however, for this to become a reality incentive in the range 0.86-1.03 (sic)/m(3) are required.

"Modeling of smart mixing regimes to improve marine biorefinery productivity and energy efficiency","Golberg, Alexander and Liberzon, Alexander","2015","Algal Research-biomass Biofuels And Bioproducts","Biorefineries aim to provide sustainable production of food and generation of low carbon energy in the next decades. Current strategies for biorefinery reply mostly on the classic terrestrial agriculture for biomass production. However, land availability, competition with food crops and total energy balance are challenging limiting factors for terrestrial bioenergy crop production. Off-shore macroalgae production could provide alternative, sustainable feedstocks for biorefineries without competition with food crops. Increasing the yields of off-shore macroalgae cultivation systems could further improve the total energy balance of the marine biorefineries. In this work, based on the fundamental principle of timing differences between light harvesting and carbon fixation in algae, we developed a theoretical framework for increasing the yields of off-shore macroalgae biomass using external mechanical mixing. We show that for a given physiological parameter of macroalgae light harvesting and carbon fixation, mixing could allow for increase of the total energy gain by two orders of magnitude. The overall biorefinery to biofuel efficiency, however, is constrained by drag and macroalgae thallus size. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Sustainable saline microalgae co-cultivation for biofuel production: A critical review","Ishika, Tasneema and Moheimani, Navid R. and Bahri, Parisa A.","2017","Renewable \& Sustainable Energy Reviews","Microalgae have gained increased attention as a viable, eco-friendly and alternative source of green bioenergy. To compete in the fuel market, saline microalgae cultivation for biofuel production would need to be economically sustainable and co-cultivation of saline microalgae using only saline water and recycled nutrient can potentially be the best solution to reduce the excessive use and prompt downsizing of natural resources like fresh water and fertilizers. This review provides a critical analysis on the selection of potential biofuel producing marine, halotolerant and halophilic microalgae. Here we proposed a microalgae co-cultivation strategy from seawater salinity (35ppt) to salt saturation (300ppt) with biofuel as the main output. We focused that adaptation of a co-cultivation strategy could reduce 95\%, 74\% and 51\% of the overall nutrient waste compared to the monoculture of marine, halotolerant and halophilic microalgae. This paper also highlights a cultivation strategy using both mono and mixed culture over the period of increased saline condition and compares mass industrial scale biofuel production from microalgae in three sites in Western Australia.","Science \& Technology - Other Topics; Energy \& Fuels","2017.332","selected",""
"Deep Water Nutrient Supply for an Offshore Ulva sp. Cultivation Project in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea: Experimental Simulation and Modeling","Zollmann, M. and Traugott, H. and Chemodanov, A. and Liberzon, A. and Golberg, A.","2019","Bioenergy Research","Offshore cultivation of marine macroalgae is a potential sustainable resource for fuel, food, and chemicals. Offshore, the high productivity of macroalgae cultivation depends on external nitrogen supply. The current work examines the idea of supplying nitrogen for Ulva sp. cultivation in the oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) by artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich deep seawater (DSW). Growth rates, protein, and starch contents of Ulva sp. were measured for time varying fertilizations with nitrate concentrations corresponding to nutrient concentrations of DSW at increasing depths of the EMS. A maximal relative growth rate of 7.4% was measured for fertilizing ten times per week with 5.8Â Î¼M, which corresponds to the artificial upwelling from the depth of 700Â m at EMS. Protein and starch contents ranged between 1â€“6 and 8â€“15% of dry weight. Finally, yields and energetic costs of DSW pumping were modeled for an example case of 10-ha offshore farm. The model predicts a high productivity but low energetic efficiency, which can be improved by coupling the biomass production with offshore power sources such as ocean thermal energy conversion.

"Biological processes for mitigation of greenhouse gases","Benemann, JR","1999","NANA","Biological processes driven by photosynthesis cycle through the atmosphere well over an order of magnitude more CO2 than is currently emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels. Already human activities control and appropriate almost half the primary photosynthetic productivity of the planet. Better management of natural and man-made ecosystems affords many opportunities for mitigation of greenhouse gases, through sink enhancements, source reductions and substitution of fossil fuels with biofuels. Biofuels can be recovered from most organic wastes, from agricultural and forestry residues, and from biomass produced solely for energy use. However, the currently low costs of fossil fuels limits the markets for biofuels. Accounting for the greenhouse gas mitigation value of biofuels would significantly increase their contribution to world fuel supplies, estimated to be currently equivalent to about 15\% of fossil fuel usage. Another limiting factor in expanding the use of biofuels is the relatively low solar energy conversion efficiencies of photosynthesis. Currently well below 1\% of solar energy is converted into biomass energy even by intensive agricultural or forestry systems, with peak conversion efficiencies about 2 to 3 \% for sugar cane or microalgae cultures. One approach to increase photosynthetic efficiencies, being developed at the University of California Berkeley, is to reduce the amount of light-gathering chlorophyll in microalgae and higher plants. This would reduce mutual shading and also increase photosynthetic efficiencies under full sunlight intensities. Estimates of the potential of photosynthetic greenhouse mitigation processes vary widely. However, even conservative estimates for biofuels substituting for fossil fuels project the potential to reduce a large fraction of current increases in atmospheric CO2 levels. Biofuels production will require integration with existing agronomic, forestry and animal husbandry systems, and improved utilization-conversion processes. The diffuse nature of biomass resources requires relatively small-scale processes for their utilization as solid fuels or conversion to liquid and gaseous fuels. Earlier proposals for enormous energy plantations feeding large power plants, or for establishing huge ocean kelp farms, were impractical. As are some recent ``geoengineering{'' proposals, such as ocean fertilization. In biomass utilization, combustion is generally preferable to more complex processes, such as thermal or biochemical conversions to oils and alcohols. The co-firing of biomass in fossil power plants avoids many of the scale, procurement, and efficiency limitations of stand-alone systems and provides significant near-term opportunities for CO2 mitigation. Landfill gas recovery, due to the large greenhouse gas forcing of methane gas, is another currently available technology that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Wastes and residues provide many opportunities for biofuels production and CO2 mitigation. Mitigating global warming with biological processes requires overcoming many scientific, technological, financial, institutional, regulatory and, perhaps most important, environmental barriers. This necessitates a major, world-wide and long-term, sustained research, development and implementation effort.","Engineering; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Geology","1999.223","selected",""
"Hydrothermal co-solvent processing of marine algae biomass","Jena, U. and Han, Y. and Cui, Z. and Hoekman, S.K.","2018","Asabe 2018 Annual International Meeting","Hydrothermal liquefaction (or HTL) of microalgae biomass is a promising conversion technology in which wet biomass is treated under high temperature (280-350 oC) and pressure (700-3000 psi), and the associated water in the wet biomass forms the reaction medium. A significant fraction of the microalgae cell is converted into biocrude, which separates from the aqueous layer by gravity and/or chemical/mechanical methods. Since the HTL process uses the whole biomass, increasing lipid content during microalgae cultivation is not essential. With an overall goal to utilize highly productive algal strains into a liquid hydrocarbon fuel/ fuel precursor, the current research investigates HTL conversion of a marine algae feedstock (Tetraselmis) and a freshwater algae (Spirulina) in the presence of co-solvents. HTL was performed using a 1.2 L Parr reactor at 275-350 oC for 30 min in the presence or absence of a co-solvent (ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol). The results showed that Tetraselmis algae preferred severe conditions and biocrude yield increased with temperature increasing from 16% -25%. Addition of 10% of co-solvent promoted biocrude oil conversion. The yield at high temperature with co-solvent didnâ€™t change significantly, while the yield with co-solvents at low temperature was much higher (29%). Spirulina produced 40-45% biocrude yield under all HTL conditions. This study also reports the characteristics of the obtained biocrude.

At the Algae Systems plant in Daphne AL, this process was used to treat up to 50,000 gal/day of incoming raw wastewater. A combination of algae nutrient uptake, aeration by photosynthetically produced oxygen, and dewatering via suspended air flotation removed 75\% of total nitrogen, 93\% of total phosphorus and 92\% BOD from influent wastewater. Offshore PBRs contained evolving polycultures of microalgae and associated heterotrophs, with community composition shifting based on the dynamic external and internal environment. During one year of operation, microalgae composition shifted from dominance of Scenedesmus dimorphus to a diverse polyculture dominated by genus Chlorella, Cryptomonas and Scenedesmus. ``The more, the merrier{''} approach to species richness produced resilient communities, enabling efficient nutrient uptake due to niche complementarity and eliminating process downtime due to biological disruptions. The resulting biomass was suitable for fuel conversion via hydrothermal liquefaction due to consistent lipid content, low ash content, and consistent elemental composition.

"The Analysis on the Current Situation of the Utilization Mode of Microalgal Biomass Materials","Zhang, L. and Wang, L. and Nie, H. and Liu, C.","2022","Advances In Multimedia","In recent years, global warming caused by the greenhouse effect has become one of the greatest threats to mankind. This will have a serious impact on the environment and human body, such as land desertification, increase in ocean acidity, sea level rise, and increase in pests and diseases; affect people's normal work and rest; and make people feel dizzy and nauseated. Excessive emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main component of the greenhouse gas, have contributed to the continued rise in Earth's temperature. Although the world is vigorously developing clean energy to reduce carbon emissions, it will not replace fossil fuels in the short term. The conversion of biomass into energy is the most important way of energy utilization. Biomass energy refers to the solar energy stored in biomass in the form of chemical energy and is the fourth major energy source after oil, coal, and natural gas. At present, biofuels have gone through three developmental stages, which can be divided into first-generation biofuels, second-generation biofuels, and third-generation biofuels according to the types of raw materials and development history. The first generation of biofuels produced from food crops, such as bioethanol derived from sucrose and starch, has already entered the energy market. However, because the first generation of biofuels uses food crops as raw materials, there is a phenomenon of ""competing with people for food,""and it is difficult to achieve large-scale application. To avoid the problem of food shortages, second-generation biofuels produced from nonfood crops, such as wood fiber, have been developed. Microalgae biomass energy is favored by governments and scholars all over the world because of its unique advantages of fast reproduction speed and high oil content. The cultivation of microalgae does not occupy traditional farmland, and the marginal land such as mountains, oceans, and deserts can cultivate microalgae, or develop microalgae cultivation in the air through the innovation of microalgae photosynthetic reactors. When municipal wastewater, food industry wastewater, and aquaculture wastewater are used as the medium for large-scale cultivation of microalgae, and waste gas from biogas power generation, flue gas from coal power plants, and industrial waste gas from fermentation are used as the CO2 gas source for large-scale cultivation of microalgae, it can be further reduced. The comprehensive production cost of microalgae bioenergy plays a significant emission reduction effect. Combining the above advantages, the use of microalgae to produce first- or second-generation bioenergy has become a new research direction. This study focuses on the review of microalgal biomass in fuel, nonfuel, wastewater treatment, and fuel cell. Â© 2022 Lina Zhang et al.",NA,"2022.2763","selected",""

The bioreactor is the core of bioprocess engineering and is the premise for the commercial application of certain types of biotechnology. The challenges of phototrophic cultivation are completely different from those of heterotrophic processes because the efficiency of phototrophic cultivation is limited by the energy density of the input sunlight and the inorganic carbon supply. Thus, the development of microalgae cultivation technologies with low manufacturing and operating costs is key to addressing this problem, and floating photobioreactors (PBRs) are a promising solution. PBRs are deployed on the water surface without any land requirements, and wave energy provides free mixing energy. Additionally, the surrounding water can be used to control the culture temperature and to supply nutrients for microalgae growth.

"The underexplored potential of green macroalgae in aquaculture","Moreira, Anthony and Cruz, Sonia and Marques, Ruben and Cartaxana, Paulo","2022","Reviews In Aquaculture","Green macroalgae (Chlorophyta) currently represent a residual fraction (<1\%) of global seaweed biomass production landings. In turn, red (Rhodophyta) and brown (Ochrophyta) macroalgae dominate the remaining percentage of aquaculture production, exceeding 32 million tonnes per annum. However, the industry relies on a relatively low number of species, in which as few as seven macroalgal genera collectively represent the bulk of global production metrics. At present, innovation and increased sustainability of the industry calls for diversification of macroalgal species/strains in aquaculture to counteract potential adverse effects ensuing from genetic impoverishment, decreased resilience to disease and climate change. Despite the dominance of red and brown seaweed regarding production figures, aquaculture of green macroalgae has witnessed an increasing trend in productivity and diversification over the last decades, particularly in Asia, where green seaweed taxa often occupy specific market niches in the food sector. Furthermore, growing interest in green seaweeds in aquaculture has been highlighted for different applications in emerging western markets (eg IMTA, biorefineries, food delicacies), owing to a unique diversity of cytomorphologies, ecophysiological traits, propagation capacities and bioactive compounds featured by this group of macroalgae. Cultivation technologies are relatively well developed, but sustainability assessments are scarce and required to unlock the potential of green seaweeds. Although it is likely that green macroalgae will remain occupying specialised market niches, in which high-value products are favoured, we argue that aquaculture of chlorophytan taxa presents itself as a compelling option under the current quest for commercial diversification of products and expansion of the sector.","Fisheries","2022.5257","selected",""
