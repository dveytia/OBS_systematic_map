"Volcanic CO2 seep geochemistry and use in understanding ocean acidification","Aiuppa, A. and Hall-Spencer, J. M. and Milazzo, M. and Turco, G. and Caliro, S. and Di Napoli, R.","2021","Biogeochemistry","Ocean acidification is one of the most dramatic effects of the massive atmospheric release of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) that has occurred since the Industrial Revolution, although its effects on marine ecosystems are not well understood. Submarine volcanic hydrothermal fields have geochemical conditions that provide opportunities to characterise the effects of elevated levels of seawater CO2 on marine life in the field. Here, we review the geochemical aspects of shallow marine CO2-rich seeps worldwide, focusing on both gas composition and water chemistry. We then describe the geochemical effects of volcanic CO2 seepage on the overlying seawater column. We also present new geochemical data and the first synthesis of marine biological community changes from one of the best-studied marine CO2 seep sites in the world (off Vulcano Island, Sicily). In areas of intense bubbling, extremely high levels of pCO(2) (> 10,000 mu atm) result in low seawater pH (< 6) and undersaturation of aragonite and calcite in an area devoid of calcified organisms such as shelled molluscs and hard corals. Around 100-400 m away from the Vulcano seeps the geochemistry of the seawater becomes analogous to future ocean acidification conditions with dissolved carbon dioxide levels falling from 900 to 420 mu atm as seawater pH rises from 7.6 to 8.0. Calcified species such as coralline algae and sea urchins fare increasingly well as sessile communities shift from domination by a few resilient species (such as uncalcified algae and polychaetes) to a diverse and complex community (including abundant calcified algae and sea urchins) as the seawater returns to ambient levels of CO2. Laboratory advances in our understanding of species sensitivity to high CO2 and low pH seawater, reveal how marine organisms react to simulated ocean acidification conditions (e.g., using energetic trade-offs for calcification, reproduction, growth and survival). Research at volcanic marine seeps, such as those off Vulcano, highlight consistent ecosystem responses to rising levels of seawater CO2, with the simplification of food webs, losses in functional diversity and reduced provisioning of goods and services for humans.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Geology","2021.5278","excluded",""
"Resilient consumers accelerate the plant decomposition in a naturally acidified seagrass ecosystem","Lee, J. and Gambi, M.C. and Kroeker, K.J. and Munari, M. and Peay, K. and Micheli, F.","2022","Global Change Biology","Anthropogenic stressors are predicted to alter biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide. However, scaling up from species to ecosystem responses poses a challenge, as species and functional groups can exhibit different capacities to adapt, acclimate, and compensate under changing environments. We used a naturally acidified seagrass ecosystem (the endemic Mediterranean Posidonia oceanica) as a model system to examine how ocean acidification (OA) modifies the community structure and functioning of plant detritivores, which play vital roles in the coastal nutrient cycling and food web dynamics. In seagrass beds associated with volcanic CO2 vents (Ischia, Italy), we quantified the effects of OA on seagrass decomposition by deploying litterbags in three distinct pH zones (i.e., ambient, low, extreme low pH), which differed in the mean and variability of seawater pH. We replicated the study in two discrete vents for 117 days (litterbags sampled on day 5, 10, 28, 55, and 117). Acidification reduced seagrass detritivore richness and diversity through the loss of less abundant, pH-sensitive species but increased the abundance of the dominant detritivore (amphipod Gammarella fucicola). Such compensatory shifts in species abundance caused more than a threefold increase in the total detritivore abundance in lower pH zones. These community changes were associated with increased consumption (52%â€“112%) and decay of seagrass detritus (up to 67% faster decomposition rate for the slow-decaying, refractory detrital pool) under acidification. Seagrass detritus deployed in acidified zones showed increased N content and decreased C:N ratio, indicating that altered microbial activities under OA may have affected the decay process. The findings suggest that OA could restructure consumer assemblages and modify plant decomposition in blue carbon ecosystems, which may have important implications for carbon sequestration, nutrient recycling, and trophic transfer. Our study highlights the importance of within-community response variability and compensatory processes in modulating ecosystem functions under extreme global change scenarios.

"An ocean acidification-simulated system and its application in coral physiological studies","Zheng Xinqing and Wang Chenying and Hadi, Tri Aryono and Ye Youyin and Pan Ke","2018","Acta Oceanologica Sinica","Due to the elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, ocean acidification (OA) has recently emerged as a research theme in marine biology due to an expected deleterious effect of altered seawater chemistry on calcification. A system simulating future OA scenario is crucial for OA-related studies. Here, we designed an OA-simulated system (OASys) with three solenoid-controlled CO2 gas channels. The OASys can adjust the pH of the seawater by bubbling CO2 gas into seawaters via feedback systems. The OASys is very simple in structure with an integrated design and is new-user friendly with the instruction. Moreover, the OASys can monitor and record real-time pH values and can maintain pH levels within 0.02 pH unit. In a 15-d experiment, the OASys was applied to simulate OA in which the expected target pH values were 8.00, 7.80 and 7.60 to study the calcifying response of Galaxea fascicularis. The results showed daily mean seawater pH values held at pH 8.00 +/- 0.01, 7.80 +/- 0.01 and 7.61 +/- 0.01 over 15 d. Correspondingly, the coral calcification of G. fascicularis gradually decreased with reduced pH.","Oceanography","2018.5692","excluded",""
"High CO2 detrimentally affects tissue regeneration of Red Sea corals","Horwitz, R. and Fine, M.","2014","Coral Reefs","Ocean acidification (OA) from rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is threatening the future of coral reef ecosystems. Mounting experimental evidence suggests that OA negatively impacts fundamental life functions of scleractinian corals, including growth and sexual reproduction. Although regeneration is regarded as a chief life function in scleractinian corals and essential to maintain the colony's integrity, the effect of OA on regeneration processes has not yet been investigated. To evaluate the effects of OA on regeneration, the common Indo-Pacific corals Porites sp., Favia favus, Acropora eurystoma, and Stylophora pistillata were inflicted with lesions (314-350 mm2, depending on species) and incubated in different pCO2: (1) ambient seawater (400 Î¼atm, pH 8.1), (2) intermediate (1,800 Î¼atm, pH 7.6), and (3) high (4,000 Î¼atm, pH 7.3) for extended periods of time (60-120 d). While all coral species after 60 d had significantly higher tissue regeneration in ambient conditions as compared to the intermediate and high treatments, reduction in regeneration rate was more pronounced in the slow-growing massive Porites sp. and F. favus than the relatively fast-growing, branching S. pistillata and A. eurystoma. This coincided with reduced tissue biomass of Porites sp., F. favus, and A. eurystoma in higher pCO2, but not in S. pistillata. Porites sp., F. favus, and S. pistillata also experienced a decrease in Symbiodinium density in higher pCO2, while in A. eurystoma there was no change. We hypothesize that a lowered regenerative capacity under elevated pCO2 may be related to resource trade-offs, energy cost of acid/base regulation, and/or decrease in total energy budget. This is the first study to demonstrate that elevated pCO2 could have a compounding influence on coral regeneration following injury, potentially affecting the capacity of reef corals to recover following physical disturbance.

This ocean acidification has negative but variable impacts on individual performance in many marine species. However, little is known about the adaptive capacity of species to respond to an acidified ocean, and, as a result, predictions regarding future ecosystem responses remain incomplete. Here we demonstrate that ocean acidification generates striking patterns of genome-wide selection in purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) cultured under different CO2 levels. We examined genetic change at 19,493 loci in larvae from seven adult populations cultured under realistic future CO2 levels. Although larval development and morphology showed little response to elevated CO2, we found substantial allelic change in 40 functional classes of proteins involving hundreds of loci. Pronounced genetic changes, including excess amino acid replacements, were detected in all populations and occurred in genes for biomineralization, lipid metabolism, and ion homeostasis-gene classes that build skeletons and interact in pH regulation. Such genetic change represents a neglected and important impact of ocean acidification that may influence populations that show few outward signs of response to acidification. Our results demonstrate the capacity for rapid evolution in the face of ocean acidification and show that standing genetic variation could be a reservoir of resilience to climate change in this coastal upwelling ecosystem. However, effective response to strong natural selection demands large population sizes and may be limited in species impacted by other environmental stressors.","Science \& Technology - Other Topics","2013.10225","excluded",""
"Increased temperature, but not acidification, enhances fertilization and development in a tropical urchin: potential for adaptation to a tropicalized eastern Australia","Foo, Shawna A. and Dworjanyn, Symon A. and Khatkar, Mehar S. and Poore, Alistair G. B. and Byrne, Maria","2014","Evolutionary Applications","To predict the effects of global change on marine populations, it is important to measure the effects of climate stressors on performance and potential for adaptation. Adaptation depends on heritable genetic variance for stress tolerance being present in populations. We determined the effects of near-future ocean conditions on fertilization success of the sea urchin Pseudoboletia indiana. In 16 multiple dam-sire crosses, we quantified genetic variation in tolerance of warming (+3 degrees C) and acidification (-0.3 to 0.5 pH units) at the gastrulation stage. Ocean acidification decreased fertilization across all dam-sire combinations with effects of pH significantly differing among the pairings. Decreased pH reduced the percentage of normal gastrulae with negative effects alleviated by increased temperature. Significant sire by environment interactions indicated the presence of heritable variation in tolerance of stressors at gastrulation and thus the potential for selection of resistant genotypes, which may enhance population persistence. A low genetic correlation indicated that genotypes that performed well at gastrulation in low pH did not necessarily perform well at higher temperatures. Furthermore, performance at fertilization was not necessarily a good predictor of performance at the later stage of gastrulation. Southern range edge populations of Pseudoboletia indiana may benefit from future warming with potential for extension of their distribution in south-east Australia.","Evolutionary Biology","2014.4360","excluded",""
"Effect of environmental stress on non-structural carbohydrates reserves and transfer in seagrasses","Jiang, Z. and Huang, X. and Zhang, J.","2012","Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica","The seagrass bed is one of the most productive wetland ecosystems, providing valuable ecological goods and services. About 2%-5% of seagarss populations disappeared each year on Earth, which has been due to a wide variety of human and natural disturbances in recent years. The dynamics of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) reserves play an important role in determining seagrass growth and its response to environmental disturbances. In order to improve our understanding of the NSC in seagrasses, the information on the NSC responses to environmental stresses, such as light, nutrient, salinity, ocean acidification, temperature, sulfide and animal grazing were summarized. Seagrasses are particularly sensitive to reductions in light availability, where small decreases can cause significant declines in growth and distribution. During periods of reduced photosynthesis caused by light limitation, the stored NSC in belowground tissue can be reallocated to meet the C (Carbon) demand of seagrasses. Thus, seagrass species with higher belowground biomass and carbohydrate storage capacity can tolerate longer period of light limitation. Nitrogen assimilation requires carbon skeletons for the respiratory pathway and reserves. Under excessive nitrogen conditions, carbon requirements for synthesizing amino acids may exceed carbon fixation capacity, leading to a decrease in NSC concentration and NSC reserves reallocation. Under hypo- and hypersaline conditions, a number of organic compounds in seagrass including soluble sugar can be produced in response to salinity stress. Furthermore, carbon skeletons are also important for the synthesis and accumulation of proline (and other nitrogen containing osmotica such as glycine betaine or ectoine) during elevated salinities. Ocean acidification may promote seagrass photosynthesis, resulting in an increase of NSC synthesis in aboveground tissue and transfer to belowground tissue. And the belowground tissues of seagrass became a sink for fixed carbon. The effect of temperature on the NSC accumulation was significant by means of altering seagrass photosynthesis, respiration and nitrogen metabolism. Additionally, the decrease of NSC biosynthesis and reserves was resulted from both sulfide and animal grazing by inhibiting the enzyme activity and grazing seagrass photosynthetic tissue, respectively. Finally, research fields in the future are pointed out including: (1) the transformation mechanism between NSC and structural carbohydrates, and between soluble sugar and starch of seagrass in different life stage (seed dormancy and germination, development and reproduction); (2) the coupling impact of dual and/or more environmental factors on seagrass NSC; (3) the application of NSC as an ecological indicator for evaluating the seagrass ecosystem health evaluation.",NA,"2012.9763",NA,""

We suggest that this distinct diel pattern in pH and pCO(2) could be associated with the enhancement of total alkalinity (TA) production coupled to carbonate sediment dissolution in a semienclosed lagoon. The confinement of the IL may hamper water exchange and seagrass detritus export to the adjacent open ocean, which may result in higher organic matter loading to the sediments, and longer residence time of the water in the IL, accompanied by microbial respiration (both aerobic and anaerobic) that may reduce carbonate saturation level to drive carbonate dissolution and thus TA elevation, thereby forming such a unique diel pattern in carbonate chemistry. This finding further highlights the importance of considering TA production through metabolic carbonate dissolution when evaluating the potential of coastal blue carbon ecosystems to buffer ocean acidification and to absorb atmospheric CO2, in particular in a semienclosed setting.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2021.2073","selected",""

This work has informed societal considerations of the climate responsibilities of these major industrial carbon producers. Here, we extend this work to historical (1880-2015) and recent (1965-2015) acidification of the world's ocean. Using an energy balance carbon-cycle model, we find that emissions traced to the 88 largest industrial carbon producers from 1880-2015 and 1965-2015 have contributed 55\% and 51\%, respectively, of the historical 1880-2015 decline in surface ocean pH. As ocean acidification is not spatially uniform, we employ a three-dimensional ocean model and identify five marine regions with large declines in surface water pH and aragonite saturation state over similar historical (average 1850-1859 to average 2000-2009) and recent (average 1960-1969 to average of 2000-2009) time periods. We characterize the biological and socioeconomic systems in these regions facing loss and damage from ocean acidification in the context of climate change and other stressors.

Yet, there is limited research investigating the cumulative impacts of anthropogenic stressors on the structure and functioning of seagrass benthic assemblages, key drivers of OM mineralization and burial. Here, using a 16-month field experiment, we assessed how meiobenthic assemblages and extracellular enzymatic activities (as a proxy of OM degradation) in Posidonia oceanica sediments responded to ocean acidification (OA) and nutrient loadings, at CO2 vents. P. oceanica meadows were exposed to three nutrient levels (control, moderate, and high) at both ambient and low pH sites. OA altered meiobenthic assemblage structure, resulting in increased abundance of annelids and crustaceans, along with a decline in foraminifera. In addition, low pH enhanced OM degradation rates in seagrass sediments by enhancing extracellular enzymatic activities, potentially decreasing the sediment carbon storage capacity of seagrasses. Nutrient enrichment had no effect on the response variables analyzed, suggesting that, under nutrient concentration unlikely to cause N or P imitation, a moderate increase of dissolved nutrients in the water column had limited influence on meiobenthic assemblages. These findings show that OA can significantly alter meiobenthic assemblage structure and enhance OM degradation rates in seagrass sediments. As meiofauna are ubiquitous key actors in the functioning of benthic ecosystems, we postulated that OA, altering the structure of meiobenthic assemblages and OM degradation, could affect organic carbon sequestration over large spatial scales.","Marine \& Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","2020.5180","selected",""
"Sea urchins in a high CO2 world: Impacts of climate warming and ocean acidification across life history stages","Byrne, M. and HernÃ¡ndez, J.C.","2020","Developments In Aquaculture And Fisheries Science","Uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) is changing seawater chemistry (ocean acidification) causing a reduction in seawater pH and saturation state (Î©) of the CaCO3 minerals needed for calcification and increased organism hypercapnia (pCO2). Ocean acidification and global warming are having negative impacts on sea urchin larvae and adults. As sea urchins calcify in both these life stages, they have been used as a model group to investigate the impacts of climate change on marine species. In general, near-future acidification has a stunting effect on sea urchin growth as seen in smaller larval and adult skeletons, a change largely caused by energetic constraints and reduced Î©. These effects can be reduced by moderate warming and sufficient food supply. Variation in the response to acidification and/or warming within and between species indicates that there is capacity for phenotypic plasticity to adjust to changing climate. The presence of sea urchin populations at naturally acidified habitats indicates resilience to acidification and highlights species-specific and biological system adaptive strategies to life at low pH. We need to identify the sea urchin species that are resilient and their phenotypic plastic responses or genetic adaptations to climatic stressors to understand the echinoid fauna of the future.

"Simulated effect of calcification feedback on atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidification","Zhang, Han and Cao, Long","2016","Scientific Reports","Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 reduces pH and saturation state of calcium carbonate materials of seawater, which could reduce the calcification rate of some marine organisms, triggering a negative feedback on the growth of atmospheric CO2. We quantify the effect of this CO2-calcification feedback by conducting a series of Earth system model simulations that incorporate different parameterization schemes describing the dependence of calcification rate on saturation state of CaCO3. In a scenario with SRES A2 CO2 emission until 2100 and zero emission afterwards, by year 3500, in the simulation without CO2-calcification feedback, model projects an accumulated ocean CO2 uptake of 1462 PgC, atmospheric CO2 of 612 ppm, and surface pH of 7.9. Inclusion of CO2-calcification feedback increases ocean CO2 uptake by 9 to 285 PgC, reduces atmospheric CO2 by 4 to 70 ppm, and mitigates the reduction in surface pH by 0.003 to 0.06, depending on the form of parameterization scheme used. It is also found that the effect of CO2-calcification feedback on ocean carbon uptake is comparable and could be much larger than the effect from CO2-induced warming. Our results highlight the potentially important role CO2-calcification feedback plays in ocean carbon cycle and projections of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations.","Science \& Technology - Other Topics","2016.1085","excluded",""

The decrease in seawater pH may result in a reduction in the concentration of both hydroxide and carbonate (OHâ€“ and CO3 2Â âˆ’). The main aim of this work is to conduct an ecotoxicology comparative survey using two amphipod species from Europe and Brazil exposed to different acidification (CO2) scenarios. For it, an integrative approach based on the weight of evidence was used for comparative proposes to identify the effects on the amphipods association with the acidification and with the related mobility of metals. The results demonstrate that the Ampelisca brevicornis species is more sensitive to pH reductions than the Hyale youngi species. Furthermore, this study has demonstrated that the CO2 enrichment in aquatic ecosystems would cause changes on the mobility of certain metals (Zn, Cu and As). The results of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the dissolved Zn in overlying water was strongly correlated with the decrease in the pH and was associated with increased toxicity of the sediment to the exposed organisms, mainly for the A. brevicornis species from Spain. Nevertheless, similar results were found in relation to the mortality of amphipods in low pH values for all sediment tested.

"Community interactions dampen acidification effects in a coastal plankton system","Rossoll, D. and Sommer, U. and Winder, M.","2013","Marine Ecology Progress Series","Changing seawater chemistry towards reduced pH as a result of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is affecting oceanic organisms, particularly calcifying species. Responses of non-calcifying consumers are highly variable and mainly mediated through indirect ocean acidification effects induced by changing the biochemical content of their prey, as shown within single species and simple 2-trophic level systems. However, it can be expected that indirect CO2 impacts observed at the single species level are compensated at the ecosystem level by species richness and complex trophic interactions. A dampening of CO2-effects can be further expected for coastal communities adapted to strong natural fluctuations in pCO(2), typical for productive coastal habitats. Here we show that a plankton community of the Kiel Fjord was tolerant to CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) levels projected for the end of this century (<1400 mu atm), and only subtle differences were observed at the extremely high value of 4000 mu atm. We found similar phyto- and microzooplankton biomass and copepod abundance and egg production across all CO2 treatment levels. Stoichiometric phytoplankton food quality was minimally different at the highest pCO(2) treatment, but was far from being potentially limiting for copepods. These results are in contrast to studies that include only a single species, which observe strong indirect CO2 effects for herbivores and suggest limitations of biological responses at the level of organism to community. Although this coastal plankton community was highly tolerant to high fluctuations in pCO(2), increase in hypoxia and CO2 uptake by the ocean can aggravate acidification and may lead to pH changes outside the range presently experienced by coastal organisms.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","2013.1316","excluded",""

The marine carbonate system is not well characterized in the Arctic, where challenging logistics and extreme conditions limit observations of atmospheric CO2 flux and ocean acidification. Here, we present a high-resolution marine carbon system data set covering the complete cycle of sea-ice growth and melt in an Arctic estuary (Nunavut, Canada). This data set was collected through three consecutive yearlong deployments of sensors for pH and partial pressure of CO2 in seawater (pCO(2sw)) on a cabled underwater observatory. The sensors were remarkably stable compared to discrete samples: While corrections for offsets were required in some instances, we did not observe significant drift over the deployment periods. Our observations revealed a strong seasonality in this marine carbon system. Prior to sea-ice formation, air-sea gas exchange and respiration were the dominant processes, leading to increasing pCO(2sw) and reduced aragonite saturation state (Omega(Ar)). During sea-ice growth, water column respiration and brine rejection (possibly enriched in dissolved inorganic carbon, relative to alkalinity, due to ikaite precipitation in sea ice) drove pCO(2sw)to supersaturation and lowered Omega(Ar)to < 1. Shortly after polar sunrise, the ecosystem became net autotrophic, returning pCO(2sw) to undersaturation. The biological community responsible for this early switch to autotrophy (well before ice algae or phytoplankton blooms) requires further investigation. After sea-ice melt initiated, an under-ice phytoplankton bloom strongly reduced aqueous carbon (chlorophyll-a max of 2.4 mu g L-1), returning Omega(Ar) to > 1 after 4.5 months of undersaturation. Based on simple extrapolations of anthropogenic carbon inventories, we suspect that this seasonal undersaturation would not have occurred naturally. At ice breakup, the sensor platform recorded low pCO(2sw) (230 mu atm), suggesting a strong CO2 sink during the open water season.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Meteorology \& Atmospheric Sciences","2021.2474",NA,""

We show that the phytoplankton community composition was resilient to CO2 and did not diverge between the treatments. Seston FA composition was influenced by community composition, which in turn was driven by silicate and phosphate limitation in the mesocosms and showed no difference between the CO2 treatments. These results suggest that CO2 effects are dampened in coastal communities that already experience high natural fluctuations in pCO(2).

The growth rate and consumption of nitrate were higher at pH 8.1, moreover differences were observed in the duration of the latency phase, suggesting a longer acclimation process at lower pH. Changes in phosphate and iron consumption indicated a higher availability in acid treatments, however they did not enhance the growth. These denoted unfavorable effects of ocean acidification on diatoms growth.","Agriculture; Fisheries","2022.6695","excluded",""
"Ocean Acidification and the Loss of Phenolic Substances in Marine Plants","Arnold, Thomas and Mealey, Christopher and Leahey, Hannah and Miller, A. Whitman and Hall-Spencer, Jason M. and Milazzo, Marco and Maers, Kelly","2012","Plos One","Rising atmospheric CO2 often triggers the production of plant phenolics, including many that serve as herbivore deterrents, digestion reducers, antimicrobials, or ultraviolet sunscreens. Such responses are predicted by popular models of plant defense, especially resource availability models which link carbon availability to phenolic biosynthesis. CO2 availability is also increasing in the oceans, where anthropogenic emissions cause ocean acidification, decreasing seawater pH and shifting the carbonate system towards further CO2 enrichment. Such conditions tend to increase seagrass productivity but may also increase rates of grazing on these marine plants. Here we show that high CO2 / low pH conditions of OA decrease, rather than increase, concentrations of phenolic protective substances in seagrasses and eurysaline marine plants. We observed a loss of simple and polymeric phenolics in the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa near a volcanic CO2 vent on the Island of Vulcano, Italy, where pH values decreased from 8.1 to 7.3 and pCO(2) concentrations increased ten-fold. We observed similar responses in two estuarine species, Ruppia maritima and Potamogeton perfoliatus, in in situ Free-Ocean-Carbon-Enrichment experiments conducted in tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay, USA. These responses are strikingly different than those exhibited by terrestrial plants. The loss of phenolic substances may explain the higher-than-usual rates of grazing observed near undersea CO2 vents and suggests that ocean acidification may alter coastal carbon fluxes by affecting rates of decomposition, grazing, and disease. Our observations temper recent predictions that seagrasses would necessarily be ``winners{''} in a high CO2 world.","Science \& Technology - Other Topics","2012.5296",NA,""
