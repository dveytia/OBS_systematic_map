"Defining the Zostera marina (Eelgrass) Niche from Long-Term Success of Restored and Naturally Colonized Meadows: Implications for Seagrass Restoration","Oreska, Matthew P. J. and McGlathery, Karen J. and Wiberg, Patricia L. and Orth, Robert J. and Wilcox, David J.","2021","Estuaries And Coasts","Seagrass restoration can help reverse global meadow loss and restore ecosystem services, including habitat provision for commercial fish and shellfish, carbon sequestration, and improved water quality. However, restoration projects are generally expensive, and site selection remains a challenge due to uncertainty about how environmental variables affect the survival and spread of seedlings. Long-term Zostera marina (eelgrass) success/failure and expansion data from the Virginia Coast Reserve can be used to determine whether the factors that control seedling survival also explain the regional distribution of seagrass meadows. We tracked plant survival and failure within restoration plots and at natural recruitment sites from 2001 to 2015 and used machine learning methods to identify the relative importance of multiple environmental predictors, including water residence time, fetch distance, water temperature, depth, and sediment grain size. Low water residence time was the best predictor of survival, but short fetch length best explained the natural recruit distribution, consistent with hydrodynamic control of seed dispersal. Restoration plot data suggests that the eelgrass fundamental niche covers > 100 km(2) within this system, triple both the current extent and the realized niche predicted by the observed natural spread. Our results corroborate historical records that eelgrass was formerly widespread in areas where it has not spread naturally, likely due to insufficient seed delivery. Additional seeding in these areas would, therefore, increase total seagrass coverage and accelerate recovery. Mapping the total habitable area can help managers maximize the extent of seagrass and other bottom uses, including shellfish aquaculture.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2021.3138","selected",""
"Conservation and Management of Tropical Coastal Ecosystems","Gladstone, William","2009","NANA","All major coastal ecosystems in the tropics are being degraded. The problems include losses of biodiversity, reduced ecosystem functions, and costs to coastal human societies. Declines in species' abundances, and habitat loss and modification are the result of the demands for aquaculture, port construction, trawling, excessive nutrient loads, overfishing and collecting, sedimentation from catchment activities, invasive species, and climate change. A global response to these changes has been conservation and management approaches that aim to reduce, reverse, and prevent unnatural changes and address their underlying causes. Successes in conservation and management are likely when actions are designed to achieve the fundamental ecological goals of ensuring resilience, maintaining ecosystem connectivity, protecting water quality, conserving species-at-risk, conserving representative samples of species and assemblages, and managing at the appropriate spatial scale. Achieving societal aspirations for coastal ecosystems requires that management approaches address the socio-economic aspects of issues and include stakeholder consultation, participation, and education. Achieving long-term success in conservation and management requires coastal nations to address fundamental issues such as lack of information for management decision-making, population growth and poverty, limited technical and management capacity, poor governance, lack of stakeholder participation, the mismatches between the issue and the geographic scale of management, lack of an ecosystem perspective, ineffective governance and management, and a lack of awareness of the effects of human activities.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","2009.5995","excluded",""
"Oyster reef restoration facilitates the recovery of macroinvertebrate abundance, diversity, and composition in estuarine communities","Searles, Adam R. and Gipson, Emily E. and Walters, Linda J. and Cook, Geoffrey S.","2022","Scientific Reports","Historic declines in oyster populations have resulted in diminished production of ecosystem services and habitat function in many estuaries. Due to the important role of oysters in ecosystem function, scientists and resource managers have employed oyster reef restoration to mitigate declines, recover essential ecosystem services, and better habitat function. Yet, there are knowledge gaps regarding the impact of restoration efforts on ecologically valuable mid-trophic level organisms inhabiting these systems. To address this knowledge gap, here we quantify macroinvertebrate species abundance, community diversity, and composition on experimental restored oyster reefs before and after restoration, and from live (positive control) and dead (negative control) reefs in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida. Species diversity and composition on restored reefs shifted towards states similar to live (positive control) reefs within 12 months of restoration. Recovery of species abundance occurred within 18 months of restoration. The results presented herein quantify the effect of restoration on resident macroinvertebrates and provide timelines of recovery for each attribute of these communities. Further, this study presents an actionable and transferable framework for identifying effective single-species metrics of restoration success across ecosystems. The application of this framework will provide managers and researchers with tools to improve the efficiency and efficacy of post-restoration monitoring. By doing so, this study contributes significantly to the improvement of broader restoration practices in an era of unprecedented habitat loss.","Science \& Technology - Other Topics","2022.6278","excluded","exclude because not specific to climate change"
"Protected Areas for Climate Change Mitigation and Livelihood Option: A Case Study of the Bangladesh Sundarbans Mangrove Forest","Rahman, Md Mizanur and Kabir, Md Enamul and Ahmed, Imran","2017","NANA","Carbon sequestration is an important REDD+ strategy to global climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection, and livelihood generation. This study investigated the floristic composition, ecosystem level carbon sequestration, and relation between forest composition and carbon pools in three protected areas (PAs) of the Bangladesh Sundarbans Mangrove Forest. Systematic grid sampling method was employed to collect data from a total of 29 cluster plots composed of five nested circular (10 m radius) subplots of equal size (1570.50 m(2)) each during two forest inventories (in 1997 and 2010). Mean diversity, evenness, and richness of all recorded species were respectively 1.21, 0.37, and 0.59. No significant difference was observed between species diversity, evenness, and richness across three PAs. The mean ecosystem level carbon stock was measured 218.72 Mg ha(-1). The ecosystem level carbon stocks were found significantly different across the three PAs. The Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary contained the highest amount of carbon (299.49 Mg ha(-1)) followed by the Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary and the Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary. There was no significant relationship with carbon (above-and belowground) content with species diversity, evenness, and richness. Shrub-herb carbon stocks showed significant negative correlation with species diversity and evenness. We found significant variation in ecosystem level carbon sequestration across the three wildlife sanctuaries. The mean yearly ecosystem level carbon sequestration rate was 3.93 Mg ha(-1) equivalent to 14.44 Mg CO2 ha(-1). Thus, the three PAs with its total land cover of 90,747 ha (22 \% of the entire mangrove Sundarbans) have been sequestering 1.31 million ton CO2 per year which can earn 19.65 million USD yearly (@ 15 USD/ t CO2). Thus, the Sundarbans Mangrove Forest has enormous potential to address global climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and perhaps more importantly livelihoods to millions of people through participating in Payment for Environmental Services (PES) of the REDD+ financial mechanism.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Forestry; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2017.831","selected",""
"White willow sexual regeneration capacity under estuarine conditions in times of climate change","Markus-Michalczyk, Heike and Hanelt, Dieter and Denstorf, Julian and Jensen, Kai","2016","Estuarine Coastal And Shelf Science","Tidal wetlands provide both habitats for coastal populations and wildlife, and ecosystem services for human welfare. Building with nature regarding cost-effective coastal protection is of increasing interest. Much research has been carried out on plant reproduction capacities in mangroves and salt marshes, but less is known on this issue in tidal freshwater wetlands. Willows are being successfully used for bank stabilization in riverine habitats, however, today white willow softwood forests in tidal wetlands are highly fragmented, and restoration is required e.g. by the European Habitats Directive. Recently, tolerance to increasing salinity and tidal flooding was found for vegetative propagules of floodplain willows. However, the establishment of autochthonous sexual recruits is necessary to conserve the genetic diversity of local populations, and thus may be preferable in restoration. The germination and early seedling establishment of Salix alba (white willow) was experimentally studied under simulated estuarine conditions. The species tolerance to increasing salinity (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2) was tested in a climate chamber, and its tolerance to flooding at different tidal treatments (control, spring tide, daily tide 15 min and 2 h flooding) in the greenhouse. Germination was neither affected by increasing salinity nor by tidal flooding. Salix seedlings established up to salinity 1.5, but cotyledon performance and radicle growth was largely reduced at salinity 2. Under tidal flooding, seedling growth was similar in all treatments. However, in the treatments with daily tides seedling anchorage in the substrate took more than two weeks, and fewer seedlings reached a suitable length to approach the high water line. We assess S. alba sexual regeneration under estuarine conditions as generally possible. Further studies are needed on the effects of sedimentation-erosion processes on willow establishment in the field, especially on feedbacks between Salix survival and tidal wetland evolution.

"Should Hybrids Be Used in Coral Nurseries? A Case Study Comparing Caribbean Acropora spp. and Their Hybrid in the Bahamas","VanWynen, Cassie M. and Hightshoe, V, Morgan and Fogarty, Nicole D. and Dahlgren, Craig P. and Gilliam, David S.","2021","Frontiers In Marine Science","For decades, coral reef ecosystems have been in decline due to environmental stressors such as rising sea temperatures, increased disease prevalence, and other local anthropogenic sources. Considering this decline, coral restoration efforts in the Caribbean have been implemented to promote reef recovery with a focus on the coral genus Acropora. Current methods target the threatened species Acropora cervicornis and A. palmata, but little is known about the restoration potential of their hybrid taxon, A. prolifera. Using interspecific hybrids with higher fitness than one or both parental species has gained traction as a novel restoration technique. For this study, three in situ coral tree nurseries were established around Great Stirrup Cay, The Bahamas, to compare the growth and survival among acroporid taxa. Three 150 mm fragments from six putative genotypes of each acroporid taxa were collected from reefs around New Providence, The Bahamas, and transported to Great Stirrup Cay in June 2018. One fragment from each genotype was transported to each nursery site, cut into three sections (apical, middle, and basal), and suspended from PVC coral trees. Fragment survival was collected monthly for 13 months, and Total Linear Extension (TLE) values were calculated for each fragment monthly for 12 months. Nursery site significantly affected fragment survival, while taxon and fragment section did not. Total fragment mortality was 29.3\% in the first month but ranged from 0 to 5\% for the rest of the study period until July 2019 (32.7\% of remaining fragments died primarily at N1). Overall, A. prolifera growth was significantly greater than the parental species. Taxon, nursery site, and fragment section were identified as important factors affecting TLE. Apical A. prolifera fragment sections at site N3 had the greatest average linear growth at 12 months and had the greatest average growth rate per month. This study highlights the rapid growth rate of hybrid corals and suggests that fragment sections have equivalent survival and growth. Consequently, these results suggest that restoration managers may capitalize on fast growing hybrids for outplanting to degraded reefs and to increase the scale of nursery projects.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2021.6041","selected",""
"Population genetic structure of eelgrass (Zostera marina) on the Korean coast: Current status and conservation implications for future management","Kim, J.H. and Kang, J.H. and Jang, J.E. and Choi, S.K. and Kim, M.J. and Park, S.R. and Lee, H.J.","2017","Plos One","Seagrasses provide numerous ecosystem services for coastal and estuarine environments, such as nursery functions, erosion protection, pollution filtration, and carbon sequestration. Zostera marina (common name ""eelgrass"") is one of the seagrass bed-forming species distributed widely in the northern hemisphere, including the Korean Peninsula. Recently, however, there has been a drastic decline in the population size of Z. marina worldwide, including Korea. We examined the current population genetic status of this species on the southern coast of Korea by estimating the levels of genetic diversity and genetic structure of 10 geographic populations using eight nuclear microsatellite markers. The level of genetic diversity was found to be significantly lower for populations on Jeju Island [mean allelic richness (AR) = 1.92, clonal diversity (R) = 0.51], which is located approximately 155 km off the southernmost region of the Korean Peninsula, than for those in the South Sea (mean AR = 2.69, R = 0.82), which is on the southern coast of the mainland. South Korean eelgrass populations were substantially genetically divergent from one another (FST = 0.061-0.573), suggesting that limited contemporary gene flow has been taking place among populations. We also found weak but detectable temporal variation in genetic structure within a site over 10 years. In additional depth comparisons, statistically significant genetic differentiation was observed between shallow (or middle) and deep zones in two of three sites tested. Depleted genetic diversity, small effective population sizes (Ne) and limited connectivity for populations on Jeju Island indicate that these populations may be vulnerable to local extinction under changing environmental conditions, especially given that Jeju Island is one of the fastest warming regions around the world. Overall, our work will inform conservation and restoration efforts, including transplantation for eelgrass populations at the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula, for this ecologically important species.

"A mink-free GB: perspectives on eradicating American mink Neovison vison from Great Britain and its islands","Martin, Anthony R. and Lea, Vince J.","2020","Mammal Review","This paper examines the case for, and plausibility of, eradicating American mink Neovison vison from mainland Great Britain and its associated offshore islands. This invasive species causes extensive damage to native fauna throughout Europe, and the UK Government is obliged to eradicate it, if feasible, under the Bern Convention. Current mink control buys time, but is patchy and dependent on substantial funding in perpetuity. If enacted, eradication would be cheaper in the long term and much more effective in preserving native wildlife. The methodology of an eradication campaign is explored, together with risks, challenges, and a tentative timeline and cost. We judge that mink eradication is now logistically feasible, due to technological developments and experience gained from landscape-scale control. Using live traps fitted with electronic sensors - `smart' traps - as the primary means of catching mink would render the campaign efficient, humane and free of non-target mortality and negative environmental impacts. The ecological benefits of mink eradication would be profound, including greatly improving prospects for water vole Arvicola amphibius populations. Reinvasion is highly unlikely. The greatest logistical challenge is probably removing mink from Scottish west coast islands. Eradication might take around a decade and be dependent on co-ordination between many conservation, fishing, farming, and water-related organisations, together with the consent of landowners. By adding alarms to existing mink traps, land and water managers can pave the way to eradication now. A mink-free Great Britain would plausibly cost tens of millions of pounds, against which could be set the limitless future costs of mink control. Such a campaign would be by far the world's largest invasive predator eradication project by geographical area and would set a precedent for citizen-led conservation action globally. Regional trials would be extremely valuable in determining the costs and practicality of a GB-wide campaign.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Zoology","2020.11100","excluded",""
"Predicting the invasive potential of a non-native mangrove reforested plant (Laguncularia racemosa) in China","Gu, Xiaoxuan and Feng, Hongyu and Tang, Ting and Tam, Nora Fung-Yee and Pan, Hao and Zhu, Qichong and Dong, Ying and Fazlioglu, Fatih and Chen, Luzhen","2019","Ecological Engineering","Mangroves are critical inter-tidal ecosystems with high productivity and ecological significance. Afforestation was regarded as one of the key projects worldwide in recovering mangrove ecosystem function. Laguncularia racemosa, a non-native mangroves species in China has been used in mangrove afforestation, while its invasiveness is widely concerned. Understanding how it tolerates shade and salinity stresses is crucial as these factors can affect its invasive potential. However, the effects of soil salinity and light on mangroves (especially on non-native species) are ambiguous. We examined the combined effects of salinity and light on the growth and physiological responses of L. racemosa and predicted an extensive range of dispersal habitats for L. racemosa in a typical estuary using Kriging model. The field surveys showed that the seedling density and seedling height were positively correlated with light availability but negatively correlated with salinity. Our greenhouse experiment also demonstrated that moderate shading (60-80\% PAR) and low salinity treatments (0-10 psu) enhanced the survival and growth of seedlings, whereas high salinity limited their assimilation rates (A), independent of the light levels. Under high salinity (30 psu) and low light level (20\%), L. racemosa seedlings employed a water-saving strategy (248.96 +/- 24.27 mu mol.mmol(-1) in instantaneous water use efficiency), which helped them to improve their adaptability to stressful environmental conditions and maintain their growth. Our findings indicate the combined effects of salinity and light on the growth strategies of L. racemosa as well as its environmental tolerance to high salinity which limits its growth and survival in coastal ecosystems. These results can provide a reference for the management of non-native mangrove species in China and worldwide.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Engineering","2019.6891","excluded",""
"Microhabitat thermal environment controls community structure of macrobenthos on coastal infrastructures","Sun, Yong-Xu and Li, Xiao-Xu and Tan, Yue and Wang, Jie and Dong, Yun-Wei","2022","Estuarine Coastal And Shelf Science","The proliferation of coastal infrastructure in the context of coastal development, urbanization, and global change is inevitably related to the transformation of coastal community structure. For restoration of biodiversity in these human-disturbed coastal ecosystems, it is vital to untangle the community structure and thermal environments, with the consideration of the microhabitat-scale thermal environment variations. In the present study, we measured the species richness, alpha-diversity (i.e. the species composition of each surface of breakwaters), and beta-diversity (i.e. the dissimilarities among macrobenthic communities of different surfaces of breakwater) of macrobenthos on the breakwaters on a tropical shore for understanding the variation of the community structure of macrobenthos; we also monitored the operative temperatures in different surfaces of the breakwaters during the experimental period for investigating the roles of microhabitat thermal environment on the community structure of macrobenthos on the artificial infrastructure. Our results showed that there were higher species richness and abundance in the thermally benign microhabitats. The variations of beta-diversity indicated that the community structure underwent dramatic changes in different microhabitats and seasons. The population dy-namics of thermal-sensitive species (e.g. Patelloida pygmaea, Cellana toreuma, and Siphonaria japonica) largely contributed to the changes in community structure. Redundancy analysis (RDA) results showed that maximum temperature, temperature predictability (i.e. the degree to which a temperature data point in a time series is influenced by its historical values), and heating rate were important thermal characteristics driving community structure on the artificial infrastructure. These results indicate the heterogeneity of thermal environments among different microhabitats is crucial for maintaining the community structure of macrobenthos on the artificial infrastructure and suggest that structural complexity should be considered for biodiversity conservation in the design and construction of coastal infrastructure.","Marine \& Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","2022.11096","selected",""
"Eco-estates: Diversity hotspots or isolated developments? Connectivity of eco-estates in the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","Alexander, Jarryd and Smith, David A. Ehlers and Smith, Yvette C. Ehlers and Downs, Colleen T.","2019","Ecological Indicators","Population expansion and land transformation reduce biodiversity, potentially reducing environmental functionality. These effects are evident globally, and specifically in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, where land cover is being transformed for urbanisation. However, much of the urbanised areas incorporate differing levels of urban greening, which is improving local species and functional diversity. In recent years, a new form of urban greening in the form of eco-estate development has increased, which improves biodiversity and functional diversity. However, it has not yet been determined whether these eco-estates are connected to one another and the surrounding natural landscapes, allowing for natural species' colonisation, immigration and dispersal. In this study, we assessed whether eco-estates along the coast of KZN were ecologically connected to a) one another, and b) the surrounding natural landscape. Using a hybrid Least-cost Pathway/Ecological Circuit Theory approach, we modelled habitat suitability and dispersal requirements of a forest-specialised bird species in an effort to provide future development and management plans for eco-estates. Connectivity throughout coastal KZN was evident, with increased connectivity in areas of natural and urban indigenous forest and coastal thicket/dense bush and river systems (riparian zones), within which existing eco-estates were subsequently developed. Eco-estates were well connected to one another and surrounding natural landscapes, emphasising their importance as patches containing endangered indigenous forest and unprotected coastal thicket/dense bush and of increased species and functional diversity, improving local ecosystem functioning. We recommend that eco-estate development primarily focus on areas which have previously been transformed, to increase natural land cover. The intention to preserve, rehabilitate, and conserve natural land cover is fundamentally important if development is to take place within and surrounding areas of high connectivity to assist in increasing and conserving suitable habitats, improving functionality and connectivity in KZN, and assisting in offsetting the deleterious effects of future climate change.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2019.5873","excluded",""
"Oceanographic and biological influences on recruitment of benthic invertebrates to hard substrata on the Oregon shelf","Meyer, Kirstin S. and Li, Yizhen and Young, Craig M.","2018","Estuarine Coastal And Shelf Science","The number of anthropogenic substrata in the ocean - structures like oil rigs and offshore renewable energy generators - is increasing. These structures provide hard-bottom habitat in areas previously dominated by sand or mud, so they have the potential to alter species distributions or serve as ``stepping-stones{''} between other hard-bottom habitats. It is thus important to understand what factors influence the composition and abundance of benthic fauna recruiting at these sites. We examined recruitment to hard substrata (fouling panels) deployed on sand at various distances from a large rocky reef (similar to 60 m isobath) on the southern Oregon coast in 2014-2015. Recruitment was dominated by the acorn barnacle Hesperibalanus hesperius. For the majority of the study period in 2014, an anti-cyclonic eddy was present near the deployment sites. However, anomalously high recruitment of H. hesperius during August - early October 2014 coincided with dissipation of the eddy, slower bottom currents, and a positive convergence index, suggesting that H. hesperlus larvae from the adjacent area may have been accumulated and retained near our study sites. Other sessile species, including hydroids and bryozoans, recruited to the fouling panels in low abundances, and most of these species have long-range dispersal and fast growth. Mobile invertebrates observed on the fouling panels included gastropods and nudibranchs, most of which also have long-range dispersal and fast growth, and are predators as adults. Thus, a community with two trophic levels assembled on the fouling panels in a relatively short time period (< 12 weeks). None of the common hard-bottom species from the adjacent rocky reef recruited to the panels, suggesting that there is a specialized assemblage of species that can exploit hard-bottom habitats surrounded by sandy plains. Our results raise many questions about the influences of dispersal and oceanographic conditions on recruitment to hard substrata.","Marine \& Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","2018.14444","selected",""
"Strategies for land-bird conservation on Mauritius","Safford, RJ and Jones, CG","1998","Conservation Biology","The native wildlife of Mauritius is highly threatened by a variety of influences other than habitat destruction. Protection from habitat destruction atone cannot guarantee its conservation and the damage already sustained is not fully reversible Therefore, the ideal for conservation-maintenance or restoration of self-sustaining populations of all species in native ecosystems-is presently unattainable. We assessed three long-term strategies for maintaining and increasing populations of threatened native birds on the mainland and offshore islets of Mauritius, with respect to efficacy, sustainability, and side-effects. Rehabilitation of native vegetation on the mainland is likely to improve food availability over limited areas, but it can only form the basis of a long-term bird conservation strategy when population density of introduced animals, especially predators, can he reduced sustainably, at low financial cost, and without adversely affecting native wildlife. Marooning bird populations on ecologically rehabilitated islets can eliminate the predator problem, but they would be vulnerable to catastrophes (especially cyclones) and possibly disease and much habitat manage ment work is still needed. A third novel strategy-enhancement of mainland habitat using exotic plants-allows creation of source habitats, greatly reducing the predator threat. It also permits larger areas to be managed and at lower cost, than is the case with intensive rehabilitation. Habitat management regimes for conservation of threatened species or communities must be designed specifically to alleviate population-limiting factors. Ln altered environments certain exotic plants can be essential to the survival of native animal species. The most effective conservation measure must not be assumed always to be the rehabilitation of native vegetation.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","1998.1818","excluded",""

The effect of resource proliferation and protection is obvious. However, few reports have addressed the biological community association between artificial habitats and adjacent environments. Here, Illumina sequencing of 18S rDNA was performed, and the diversity, community structure, and co-occurrence networks of protists in different layers of artificial reefs (ARs) and adjacent seawater (WAR) were described to verify that constructing ARs in Bailong Pearl Bay improves local spatial heterogeneity and functional diversity. In terms of the degree of species interaction, the protist communities were ranked as follows: surface and bottom of WAR > ARs and WAR > different layers of ARs. The alpha-diversity of protists associated with ARs and WAR decreased with an increase in depth. Protist diversity was greater in WAR than in ARs. beta-Diversity analysis revealed significant differences in protist community structure between WAR and ARs (P < 0.05), and the upper layers of ARs and the middle or bottom layers of ARs differed. The key topological features of protist networks showed more positive interspecific interactions in the AR-associated protist community, a higher degree of niche differentiation, and higher complexity and stability. The keystone protists in the bottom seawater layer displayed community functions that were biased toward initial fixation in the ocean carbon cycle. The AR-associated protist community tended to participate in carbon transfer in the food chain and decomposition and utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM). This study revealed significant differences in protist community structure between ARs and the adjacent environment, and the ecological functions of the key phyla were found to be related. In conclusion, protist communities in WAR may provide food sources for AR-associated heterotrophic protists.

"Habitat connectivity and matrix restoration: the wider implications of agri-environment schemes","Donald, PF and Evans, AD","2006","Journal Of Applied Ecology","1. The spread and intensification of agriculture are recognized as two of the most important global threats to wildlife. There are clear links between agricultural change and declines in biodiversity across a wide range of agricultural systems, and convincing evidence that reversing these changes leads to a recovery in wildlife populations. 2. Nearly 4 billion euros are now paid annually through agri-environment schemes (AES) to farmers in Europe and North America to make environmental improvements to their land. Where appropriately designed and targeted, these schemes have proved successful in reversing declines in farmland wildlife populations. 3. We argue that insights gained from island biogeography and metapopulation theory, and from theoretical and empirical assessments of landscape connectivity suggest that AES may carry substantial wider benefits, which so far have not been considered in the design and deployment of such schemes. `Softening' agricultural land could offset some of the negative impacts on biodiversity of the loss and fragmentation of non-agricultural habitats; could allow species to adapt to climate change; could slow the spread of alien and invasive species; and could contribute positively to the coherence of key biodiversity and protected area networks. Indeed, AES might represent the only viable way to counter these threats. 4. We outline a number of ways in which these wider benefits could be taken account of in the design of AES and suggest a number of characteristics of the species most likely to benefit from them. 5. Synthesis and applications. Agri-environment schemes might bring significant environmental benefits to habitats other than farmland by restoring the agricultural matrix that separates them. Theoretical and empirical research suggests that matrix restoration improves a number of ecosystem functions. Where they are available, AES might therefore represent a viable mechanism for addressing a range of pandemic environmental problems such as global climate change. Little consideration has so far been given to these wider conservation applications in the design, deployment and monitoring of AES.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2006.2691","excluded",""

Additionally, the role of lucinid bivalves in N provisioning to the plant (through N-2 fixation by the symbionts) was hypothesized. Thus, lucinids may contribute to sediment detoxification and plant fitness. Seagrasses are subject to ever-increasing human pressure in coastal environments. Here, disentangling nested interactions between chemosynthetic lucinid bivalves and seagrass exposed to pollution may help to understand seagrass ecosystem dynamics and to develop successful seagrass restoration programs that consider the roles of animal-microbe symbioses. We evaluated the capacity of lucinid bivalves (Loripes orbiculatus) to promote nutrient cycling and seagrass (Cymodocea nodosa) growth during a 6-week mesocosm experiment. A fully crossed design was used to test for the effect of sediment contamination (metals, nutrients, and hydrocarbons) on plant and bivalve (alone or interacting) fitness, assessed by mortality, growth, and photosynthetic efficiency, and for the effect of their nested interaction on sediment biogeochemistry. Plants performed better in the contaminated sediment, where a larger pool of dissolved nitrogen combined with the presence of other trace elements allowed for an improved photosynthetic efficiency. In fact, pore water nitrogen accumulated during the experiment in the controls, while it was consumed in the contaminated sediment. This trend was accentuated when lucinids were present. Concurrently, the interaction between clams and plants benefitted both organisms and promoted plant growth irrespective of the sediment type. In particular, the interaction with lucinid clams resulted in higher aboveground biomass of C. nodosa in terms of leaf growth, leaf surface, and leaf biomass. Our results consolidate the notion that nested interactions involving animal-microbe associations promote ecosystem functioning, and potentially help designing unconventional seagrass restoration strategies that exploit chemosynthetic symbioses.","Plant Sciences","2022.8610","excluded",""

We evaluated how well the current protected area network and priority areas selected through previous systematic conservation planning exercises preserve biodiversity hotspots in the Gulf of California, Mexico. We also determined spatial congruence between biodiversity hotspots based on different criteria, which may determine their ability to be used as surrogates for each other. We focus on the Gulf of California because it is a megadiverse system where limited information regarding species diversity and distribution has constrained development of strategies for conservation and management. We developed a species occurrence database and identified biodiversity hotspots using four different criteria: species richness, rarity, endemism, and threatened species. We interpolated species occurrence, while accounting for heterogeneous sampling efforts. We then assessed overlap of hotspots with existing protected areas and priority areas, and between hotspots derived by distinct criteria. We gathered 286,533 occurrence records belonging to 12,105 unique species, including 6388 species identified as rare, 642 as endemic, and 386 as threatened. We found that biodiversity hotspots showed little spatial overlap with areas currently under protection and previously identified priority areas.

In this study, we examine how using different types of bait affects CPUE of European green crab (Carcinus maenas), an invasive species impacting ecosystems on the south and west coasts of the island of Newfoundland, Canada. We compared both CPUE and mean body size of green crabs caught in Fukui traps baited with Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), short-fin squid (Illex illecebrosus), blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), and Atlantic cod (Gothic morhua). We found that squid and cod produced substantially higher catch rates, and also caught larger-bodied crabs. Despite green crabs being generalist predators, our results show that bait choice affects capture efficiency, and thus managers should preface removal programs with controlled studies designed to identify locally-effective and ecologically-appropriate baits.","Fisheries","2020.11899","excluded",""
"Old concepts, new challenges: adapting landscape-scale conservation to the twenty-first century","Donaldson, Lynda and Wilson, Robert J. and Maclean, Ilya M. D.","2017","Biodiversity And Conservation","Landscape-scale approaches to conservation stem largely from the classic ideas of reserve design: encouraging bigger and more sites, enhancing connectivity among sites, and improving habitat quality. Trade-offs are imposed between these four strategies by the limited resources and opportunities available for conservation programmes, including the establishment and management of protected areas, and wildlife-friendly farming and forestry. Although debate regarding trade-offs between the size, number, connectivity and quality of protected areas was prevalent in the 1970-1990s, the implications of the same trade-offs for ongoing conservation responses to threats from accelerating environmental change have rarely been addressed. Here, we reassess the implications of reserve design theory for landscape-scale conservation, and present a blueprint to help practitioners to prioritise among the four strategies. We consider the new perspectives placed on landscape- scale conservation programmes by twenty-first century pressures including climate change, invasive species and the need to marry food security with biodiversity conservation. A framework of the situations under which available theory and evidence recommend that each of the four strategies be prioritized is provided, seeking to increase the clarity required for urgent conservation decision-making.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2017.9029",NA,""
"EFFECTS OF FISHING ON THE ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE OF CORAL-REEFS","ROBERTS, CM","1995","Conservation Biology","Overfishing is considered one of the three most significant threats to coral reef ecosystems. Exponentially increasing human populations in the tropics have placed enormous demands upon reefs as a food source. At high intensities, termed ecosystem or Malthusian overfishing, fishing causes major direct and indirect effects on the community structure of fishes and other organisms. It reduces species diversity and lends to local extinctions not only of target species brit also of other species not fished directly Conceivably it could also lend to global extinctions. Loss of keystone species, such as predators of echinoderms, through fishing, can lead to major effects on reef processes, such ns accretion of calcium carbonate. Ultimately, sustained heavy fishing may lead to loss of entire functional groups of species resulting in impairment of the potentially important ecosystem functions provided by those groups. Overfishing has been shown to interact with other agents of disturbance to reduce the ability of reefs to recover from natural occurrences such as hurricanes. Effective management of fishing will require a deeper understanding of the effects of exploitation than we now possess. Research initiatives are underway to examine the responses of fish populations to fishing, generally responses to protection from fishing. There is, however an urgent need to look beyond fish communities and to consider the entire reef ecosystem. Studies that integrate population and community biology with ecosystem processes will provide a much better understanding of the effects of biodiversity loss on reef function and will improve our ability to manage these complex systems.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","1995.1171","excluded",""
