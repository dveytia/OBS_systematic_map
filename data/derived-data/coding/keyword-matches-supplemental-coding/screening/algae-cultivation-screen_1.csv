"Dispersal and Deposition of Detritus From Kelp Cultivation","Broch, Ole Jacob and Hancke, Kasper and Ellingsen, Ingrid Helene","2022","Frontiers In Marine Science","A high resolution coastal and ocean hydrodynamic model system was used to investigate the transport and deposition patterns of Particulate Organic Matter (POM) from kelp farmed at three locations of different properties: a sheltered location, an exposed location, and an offshore location. Published values on the sinking speeds of organic particles from kelp were used, spanning several orders of magnitude. Recent work on quantifying the release of particulate organic matter from farmed kelp was used to link the release of carbon to possible cultivation volumes and scenarios, and finally to link this to the potential for carbon loading on the ocean floor. The results are presented in terms of loading and distribution per unit harvested kelp, and the loading estimates are compared with estimates of natural (background) primary production. According to the simulation results, organic matter may be transported anything from a few (hundred) meters up to a hundred km away from the release site, depending on the sinking rates, time of release, and the location. The depth at which the matter settles on the sea floor likewise depends on the properties of the matter and the sites. The time until settlement varied from minutes to several hundred hours. The results underscore the importance of constraining the dispersal and deposition of detritus from kelp cultivation in order to better understand and quantify associated environmental risks posed by organic loading, and the potential for seafloor carbon sequestration by kelp farming as a nature based climate solution.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2022.5759","selected",""
"A review of existing and potential blue carbon contributions to climate change mitigation in the Anthropocene","Gao, Guang and Beardall, John and Jin, Peng and Gao, Lin and Xie, Shuyu and Gao, Kunshan","2022","Journal Of Applied Ecology","The atmospheric concentration of CO2 is steadily increasing and causing climate change. To achieve the Paris 1.5 or 2 degrees C target, negative emission technologies must be deployed in addition to reducing carbon emissions. The ocean is a large carbon sink but the potential of marine primary producers to contribute to carbon neutrality remains unclear. Here we review the alterations to carbon capture and sequestration of marine primary producers (including traditional `blue carbon' plants, microalgae and macroalgae) in the Anthropocene, and, for the first time, assess and compare the potential of various marine primary producers to carbon neutrality and climate change mitigation via biogeoengineering approaches. The contributions of marine primary producers to carbon sequestration have been decreasing in the Anthropocene due to the decrease in biomass driven by direct anthropogenic activities and climate change. The potential of blue carbon plants (mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses) is limited by the available areas for their revegetation. Microalgae appear to have a large potential due to their ubiquity but how to enhance their carbon sequestration efficiency is very complex and uncertain. On the other hand, macroalgae can play an essential role in mitigating climate change through extensive offshore cultivation due to higher carbon sequestration capacity and substantial available areas. This approach seems both technically and economically feasible due to the development of offshore aquaculture and a well-established market for macroalgal products. Synthesis and applications. This paper provides new insights and suggests promising directions for utilizing marine primary producers to achieve the Paris temperature target. We propose that macroalgae cultivation can play an essential role in attaining carbon neutrality and climate change mitigation, although its ecological impacts need to be assessed further.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2022.1352","selected",""
"Marine algae as a co2 sink","Ritschard, R.L.","1992","Water, Air, & Soil Pollution","The most effective ways to reduce CO2 emissions are to improve the energy efficiency of each economic sector and to reduce the cutting of tropical and temperate forests around the world. These options, however, may not fully reach their technical and economic potential due to various political and socioeconomic barriers. Other more innovative and less well developed mitigation measures therefore will be required. The most practical of these is to increase CO2 sinks through photosynthesis in both standing tree biomass and in ocean primary producers. In this paper, the use of marine algae as CO2 sinks is reviewed from a technical, engineering/economic, and environmental perspective. Two open ocean options are considered for large-scale CO2 mitigation: the use of phytoplankton through Fe fertilization and macroalgal (kelp) farms, which can be used for both C sequestering and energy production. It has been estimated that these two approaches can sequester from 0.7 to 3 Gt C yr-1 from the atmosphere at an estimated cost of $5 to 300 t-1 C yr-1. Other options currently under study are also mentioned. Numerous questions remain to be answered pertaining to the use of both microalgae and macroalgae for CO2 assimilation before credible estimates of costs of C removal can be made for either system. In addition, there are several key environmental issues raised by the use of algae. A detailed discussion of these variables, including cost estimates, is presented.

Marine-based biorefinery has been recently discussed as a promising route to mitigate the environmental challenges, enhance the energy recovery, and provide a potential source for value-added products. Anaerobic digestion is a promising technology that can convert the organic compounds of marine ecosystems into biogas. To date, a comprehensive review incorporating integrated biogas potential and effective approaches to enhance seaweed digestibility for biogas production from marine resources has not been reported. Thus, the present review aims to explore and comprehensively present seaweed and other marine resources for potential biogas production. The basics and challenges of biogas production from seaweed are elucidated. The impact of biochemical composition on biogas and the microbial communities involved in anaerobic digestion of seaweed are discussed. Utilization of different techniques such as pretreatment, co-digestion, and sequential extraction of seaweed biomass to enhance the biogas yield and to mitigate the effect of inhibitors are presented. Specifically, this article evaluates the co-digestion of seaweed with other biomass feedstocks or liquid biowastes. Integration of marine microalgae cultivation on anaerobic digestate for value-added compound production, biogas upgrading, and bioenergy recovery provides a promising approach towards a zero-waste marine-based system.","Biotechnology \& Applied Microbiology; Food Science \& Technology","2022.5234","selected",""

However, commercial-scale cultivation of microalgae still faces one major challenge, which is its economic feasibility, with lower cost and energy consumption. Developing floating photobioreactors to be utilized in offshore open water areas has gained more interest recently as it can diminish the cost effects of onshore land utilization, while seeking for additional benefits, such as regulated temperature, proximity to sunlight and nutrient supplies, and integrated ocean renewable energy. Thereby, this is timely to explore the potential of floating photobioreactors for microalgae cultivation in the offshore region. This review deliberately presents the characteristics of offshore environments and their potential effects on microalgae cultivation, as factors such as location selection, heat capacity, and utilization of cultivation resources are significantly different from conventional land-based cultivation. Compared to land-based photobioreactors, the design of floating photobioreactors has the opportunity to adopt hydrodynamical design; by utilizing the external force from ocean waves to generate internal liquid sloshing for improving the mixing of cultivation medium. While offshore-based microalgae cultivation is considerably new as part of blue economy and mariculture, this review provides insights into the opportunities for further advancement of offshore microalgae cultivation technologies. The encouraging factors for hybridization of offshore microalgae cultivation include mariculture, carbon dioxide capture and utilization, hydrogen production, and ocean thermal energy. Such understandings are vital to improving microalgae cultivation in offshore floating photobioreactors towards a valuable alternative to the current concerns in developing commercial scale of the microalgae industry. Various challenges in biological issues, economic and environmental challenges, installation and maintenance, as well as destructive hydrodynamic loads are also discussed.

"Exergy efficiency of solar energy conversion to biomass of green macroalgae Ulva (Chlorophyta) in the photobioreactor","Zollmann, M. and Traugott, H. and Chemodanov, A. and Liberzon, A. and Golberg, A.","2018","Energy Conversion And Management","Offshore production of macroalgae biomass, which was recently given the name seagriculture, is one of the important but least explored alternative energy resources. Unlike microalgae, macroalgae cultivation can be done offshore and therefore brings real news to the biofuel - food land agriculture conflict. A wide variety of small-scale laboratory experiments are done lately in order to deepen the knowledge and develop expertise in macroalgae cultivation and its downstream processing. For energy applications, it is common to evaluate the performance of an energy source or system in exergy efficiency terms. Another important parameter that is evaluated to determine the system's environmental impact is it's volumetric and areal footprint. The current work examines two exergy efficiency indexes, the Exergy Efficiency (EE), which takes into account all exergy inputs, and the Exergy Return On Investment (ExROI), that includes only fossil fuel exergy inputs, both on a green macroalgae Ulva grown in the macroalgae photobioreactor system (MPBR) incorporated into a building. Cultivation of macroalgae in the building embedded MPBR achieved maximal values of 0.012 and 0.22 for EE and ExROI, compared to a range of 0.05-8.34 and 0.013-0.327 found in published papers of microalgae systems. In addition, a modelled optimization of the initial biomass density leads to maximal values of about 0.035 for EE and 0.433 for ExROI, while further improvement may be achieved by optimization of nutrient addition and mixing methodology.

Macroalgae (seaweeds) are fast-growing marine plants, providing several harvests per year without the need for arable land, fertilizer, and fresh water. Various types of ecosystems like coral reefs, mangrove forests, and rocky shores can efficiently host the seaweeds production systems. These characteristics have made them highly suitable feedstocks for third-generation bioethanol production. Iran has a huge potential in renewable energy resources owing to its unique geographical location and climatic features. The country borders with the Caspian Sea in the north and with the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the south. Seaweeds farming can also play a key role in mitigating air pollution, increasing employment rate, sustaining fossil fuel resources, bioremediating contaminated water, and improving marine ecosystem in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. In the present article, macroalgae diversity, cultivation, and their conversion and upgrading technologies into bioethanol in Iran are scrutinized and discussed. Finally, the potential of Bushehr (the Persian Gulf) and Chabahar (the Gulf of Oman) coastlines for macroalgae cultivation is investigated. These locations receive the annual solar radiation in the range of 1680-1753 kWh/m(2) and the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the range of 2.6-2.71 GJ/m(2)/year with 3051-3311.9 h sunshine per annum. Furthermore, the nutrient-rich and calm water with relatively stable pH, salinity, and temperature make these coasts suitable for macroalgae farming.

"Estimating growth, loss and potential carbon sequestration of farmed kelp: a case study of Saccharina latissima at Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland","Dolliver, J. and Oâ€™Connor, N.E.","2022","Applied Phycology","Many governments are evaluating marine carbon sequestration processes for their capacity to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change. This includes the cultivation of macroalgae to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which requires accurate estimates from the field. This study estimated the potential rates of carbon sequestration of cultivated macroalgae by quantifying the amount of biomass released into the environment from a kelp, Saccharina latissima, farm in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland (54.4Â° N, 5.58Â° W). We estimated that a mean of 41% of net primary productivity (NPP) of the cultivated kelp was lost prior to harvest following blade fall-off, equivalent to a mean of 7.4 kg of carbon sequestered per 100 m longline at the site during the cultivation period. Coarse estimates requiring verification predicted that a further 43.2% of NPP may have been lost through chronic erosion and exudation of organic carbon. This rate of sequestration is similar to that of several government-funded agroforestry schemes. There is potential, therefore, that this quantified ecosystem service could be subsidized to incentivize the sustainable development of the macroalgae industry. These findings are essential for those promoting the sustainable development of the macroalgae cultivation industry and are highly relevant for implementation of UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate action) and Goal 14 (Life below water: â€œConserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable developmentâ€).

To evaluate the potential of macroalgae CDR, we developed a kelp aquaculture bio-techno-economic model in which large quantities of kelp would be farmed at an offshore site, transported to a deep water ``sink site{'' and then deposited below the sequestration horizon (1,000 m). We estimated the costs and associated emissions of nursery production, permitting, farm construction, ocean cultivation, biomass transport, and Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) for a 1,000 acre (405 ha) ``baseline{''} project located in the Gulf of Maine, USA. The baseline kelp CDR model applies current systems of kelp cultivation to deep water (100 m) exposed sites using best available modeling methods. We calculated the levelized unit costs of CO(2)eq sequestration (LCOC; \$ tCO(2)eq(-1)). Under baseline assumptions, LCOC was \$17,048 tCO(2)eq(-1). Despite annually sequestering 628 tCO(2)eq within kelp biomass at the sink site, the project was only able to net 244 C credits (tCO(2)eq) each year, a true sequestration ``additionality{''} rate (AR) of 39\% (i.e., the ratio of net C credits produced to gross C sequestered within kelp biomass). As a result of optimizing 18 key parameters for which we identified a range within the literature, LCOC fell to \$1,257 tCO(2)eq(-1) and AR increased to 91\%, demonstrating that substantial cost reductions could be achieved through process improvement and decarbonization of production supply chains. Kelp CDR may be limited by high production costs and energy intensive operations, as well as MRV uncertainty. To resolve these challenges, R\&D must (1) de-risk farm designs that maximize lease space, (2) automate the seeding and harvest processes, (3) leverage selective breeding to increase yields, (4) assess the cost-benefit of gametophyte nursery culture as both a platform for selective breeding and driver of operating cost reductions, (5) decarbonize equipment supply chains, energy usage, and ocean cultivation by sourcing electricity from renewables and employing low GHG impact materials with long lifespans, and (6) develop low-cost and accurate MRV techniques for ocean-based CDR.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2022.4836","selected",""

Because of the tremendous positive impact the success of this project would have on the local and national economy, the Jordanian government should also consider the establishment an algae biotechnology research center focusing on production of recombinant algal strains that grow rapidly and yield greater amounts of lipids. The southern part of Jordan, near Aqaba, provides a warm climate year-round, plentiful sea water, and a wealth of naturally-available minerals for enrichment of the cultivation media. A suitable bioreactor design is necessary for the continuous cultivation of the algae; the bioreactor should be coupled with a chemical/biochemical reaction stage for the large-scale transesterification required for conversion of the oil into biodiesel. Finally, it would also be advantageous to set up a carbon-neutral biodiesel-based electric generation power plant close by to supply power to neighboring cities while carbon emissions serve as a source of CO2 for the microalgal production cycle.

Manipulating microalgae cultivation conditions to prevent contamination is essential in addition to promoting optimal growth and lipid yields. Contamination of algal cultures is a major impediment to algae cultivation that can however be mitigated by choosing extremophile microalgae.

The production process of biodiesel from microalgae generally consists of five different phases: cultivation, harvesting, drying, lipid extraction and transesterification. While existing technologies are available to undertake each of these phases, the process would benefit from enhanced sustainability achieved by reducing environmental impact and costs. One process innovation currently under consideration is the use of waste products as inputs to the process, including CO2 captured from industrial flue gas, or nutrients from wastewater. These could be employed in algae cultivation. The co-location of an algae cultivation plant with other industrial facilities, such as a cement plant or a wastewater treatment facility, could result in significantly reduced atmospheric emissions and improve wastewater effluent discharges. A comparative life cycle assessment approach is used to examine two different, realistic alternatives for the co-location of an algae cultivation plant with an existing cement plant or wastewater treatment facility near Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

"Wave attenuation by suspended canopies with cultivated kelp (Saccharina latissima)","Zhu, L. and Lei, J. and Huguenard, K. and Fredriksson, D.W.","2021","Coastal Engineering","Many kelp aquaculture farms consist of moored arrays of long horizontal lines that grow kelp near the water surface. Most kelp farms are deployed in the same direction of wave propagation. However, with numerous longlines of densely grown kelp, these farms may have the potential to attenuate waves if installed perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. In this application, the kelp farm may serve as a form of nature-based coastal protection. To assess this potential, a set of 1:10 scale physical model experiments were conducted to measure the wave attenuation of a suspended kelp model. The model was scaled based on the morphological and mechanical properties of the cultivated Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp) from Saco Bay, Maine, USA. Experimental results demonstrated that suspended blades have asymmetric oscillatory motions with more bending in the opposite direction of wave propagation. Due to severe asymmetric blade motion in large waves, the suspended blade could roll over the attached line following the wave orbital motion. The results also showed that suspended kelp farms in the designed configuration with 20 longlines of 1-m-long blades and 100 blades/m have the potential attenuating wave energy by up to 33.7% under the experimental wave conditions. Based on the experimental data, empirical formulas were developed for the bulk drag coefficient (CDB) and effective blade length (le) of suspended kelp canopies for wave attenuation. To predict wave attenuation under a wider range of conditions and to identify the key parameters affecting wave attenuation, a numerical model was developed that could resolve blade motion. The benefits of resolving blade motion were to improve the model accuracy and reduce the number of experiments needed for obtaining CDB or le, which is required in the conventional wave attenuation models based on the rigid blade assumption. The results indicate that (i) the wave energy dissipation ratio (EDR defined as the ratio of the dissipated wave energy to the incident wave energy) of suspended kelp farms decreases with increased water depth, (ii) EDR is not sensitive to wave height, (iii) EDR first increases and then decreases with wavelength, and (iv) EDR increases with blade size, kelp vertical position, plant density, and the number of longlines. Therefore, the technique to improve the wave attenuation capacity of suspended kelp farms for nature-based coastal defense is to install the kelp farms in shallower water, expand the farm size by adding more longlines, locate the kelp in a higher position of the water column, grow the kelp more densely, and choose the kelp species with more rigid, wider, and longer blades/biomass.

"An ecosystem approach to kelp aquaculture in the Americas and Europe","Grebe, Gretchen S. and Byron, Carrie J. and St Gelais, Adam and Kotowicz, Dawn M. and Olson, Tollef K.","2019","Aquaculture Reports","Kelp farming is increasing along the temperate coastlines of the Americas and Europe. The economic, ecological, and social frameworks surrounding kelp farming in these new areas are in contrast with the conditions of progenitor kelp farming regions in China, Japan, and Korea. Thus, identifying and addressing the environmental and social impacts of kelp farming in these regions is vital to ensuring the industry's long-term sustainability. Here, a conceptual model of the human and natural systems supporting this nascent kelp aquaculture sector was developed using Maine, USA as a focal region. Potential negative impacts of kelp aquaculture were identified to be habitat degradation, overfishing of wild seeds, predation and competition with wild fish and genes, and transmission of diseases. Increased food security, improved restoration efforts, greater fisheries productivity, and alternative livelihoods development were determined to be potential positive impacts of kelp aquaculture. Changes in biodiversity and productivity resulting from either negative or positive impacts of kelp aquaculture were confirmed to have downstream effects on local fisheries and coastal communities. Recommendations to improve or protect the ecosystem services tangential to kelp farming include: define ecosystem and management boundaries, assess ecosystem services and environmental carrying capacity, pursue ecologically and socially considerate engineering, and protect the health and genetic diversity of wild kelp beds. Recommendations to ensure that kelp farming improves the well-being of all stakeholders include: increase horizontal expansion, expand and teach Best Management Practices, and develop climate change resiliency. Additionally, an integrated management strategy should be developed for wild and farmed kelp to ensure that kelp aquaculture is developed in the context of other sectors and goals.","Fisheries","2019.970","selected",""
"Year-round sustainable biomass production potential of Nannochloris sp. in outdoor raceway pond enabled through strategic photobiological screening","Paul, Kenny and Gaikwad, Mahadev and Choudhary, Poonam and Mohan, Natarajan and Pai, Puja and Patil, Smita D. and Pawar, Yogesh and Chawande, Akshay and Banerjee, Arun and Nagle, Vinod and Chelliah, Meenakshi and Sapre, Ajit and Dasgupta, Santanu","2022","Photosynthesis Research","Microalgae cultivation utilizes the energy of sunlight to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) for producing renewable energy feedstock. The commercial success of the biological fixation of carbon in a consistent manner depends upon the availability of a robust microalgae strain. In the present work, we report the identification of a novel marine Nannochloris sp. through multiparametric photosynthetic evaluation. Detailed photobiological analysis of this strain has revealed a smaller functional antenna, faster relaxation kinetics of non-photochemical quenching, and a high photosynthetic rate with increasing light and temperatures. Furthermore, laboratory scale growth assessment demonstrated a broad range halotolerance of 10-70 parts per thousand (PPT) and high-temperature tolerance up to 45 degrees C. Such traits led to the translation of biomass productivity potential from the laboratory scale (0.2-3.0 L) to the outdoor 50,000 L raceway pond scale (500-m(2)) without any pond crashes. The current investigation revealed outdoor single-day peak areal biomass productivity of 43 g m(-2) d(-1) in summer with an annual (March 2019-February 2020) average productivity of 20 g m(-2) d(-1) in seawater. From a sustainability perspective, this is the first report of successful round-the-year (> 347 days) multi-season (summer, monsoon, and winter) outdoor cultivation of Nannochloris sp. in broad seawater salinity (1-57 PPT), wide temperature ranges (15-40 degrees C), and in fluctuating light conditions. Concurrently, outdoor cultivation of this strain demonstrated conducive fatty acid distribution, including increased unsaturated fatty acids in winter. This inherent characteristic might play a role in protecting photosynthesis machinery at low temperatures and in high light stress. Altogether, our marine Nannochloris sp. showed tremendous potential for commercial scale cultivation to produce biofuels, food ingredients, and a sustainable source for vegetarian protein.","Plant Sciences","2022.3138","selected",""
