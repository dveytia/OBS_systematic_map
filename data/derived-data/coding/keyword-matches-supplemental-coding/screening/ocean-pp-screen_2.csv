"Artificial Upwelling in Singular and Recurring Mode: Consequences for Net Community Production and Metabolic Balance","Ortiz, Joaquin and Aristegui, Javier and Taucher, Jan and Riebesell, Ulf","2022","Frontiers In Marine Science","Artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich waters and the corresponding boost in primary productivity harbor the potential to enhance marine fishery yields and strengthen the biological pump for sequestration of atmospheric CO2. There is increasing urgency to understand this technology as a ``ocean-based solution{''} for counteracting two major challenges of the 21st century-climate change and overfishing. Yet, little is known about the actual efficacy and/or possible side effects of artificial upwelling. We conducted a large-scale off-shore mesocosm study (similar to 44 m(3)) in the oligotrophic waters of the Canary Islands to identify the community-level effects of artificial upwelling on a natural oligotrophic plankton community. Four upwelling intensities were simulated (approx. 1.5/3/5.7/10 mu mol L-1 of nitrate plus phosphate and silicate) via two different upwelling modes (a singular deep-water pulse vs. recurring supply every 4 days) for 37 days. Here we present results on the response of net community production (NCP), metabolic balance and phytoplankton community composition (<250 mu m). Higher upwelling intensities yielded higher cumulative NCP. Following upwelling onset, the phytoplankton community became dominated by diatoms in all treatments, but other taxa such as Coccolithophores increased later in the experiment. The magnitude of effects on the metabolic balance scaled with the amount of added deep water, leading to (i) a balanced to net-heterotrophic system in the singular and (ii) a net-autotrophic system in the recurring upwelling treatments. Accordingly, the mode in which nutrients are supplied to an oligotrophic system plays a crucial role in the ecosystem response, with recurring upwelling leading to higher long-term positive NCP than singular upwelling. These results highlight the importance of empirically measured local responses to upwelling such as community structure and metabolism, with major implications for the potential employment of artificial upwelling as an ocean-based solution to generate (primary) production.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2022.3997","selected",""
"Ocean iron fertilization: Why further research is needed","GÃ¼ssow, K. and Proelss, A. and Oschlies, A. and Rehdanz, K. and Rickels, W.","2010","Marine Policy","Despite large uncertainties in the fertilization efficiency, natural iron fertilization studies and some of the purposeful iron enrichment studies have demonstrated that Southern Ocean iron fertilization can lead to a significant export of carbon from the sea surface to the ocean interior. From an economic perspective the potential of ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is far from negligible in relation to other abatement options. Comparing the range of cost estimates to the range of estimates for forestation projects they are in the same order of magnitude, but OIF could provide more carbon credits even if high discount rates are used to account for potential leakage and non-permanence. However, the uncertainty about undesired adverse effects of purposeful iron fertilization on marine ecosystems and biogeochemistry has led to attempts to ban commercial and, to some extent, scientific experiments aimed at a better understanding of the processes involved, effectively precluding further consideration of this mitigation option. As regards the perspective of public international law, the pertinent agreements dealing with the protection of the marine environment indicate that OIF is to be considered as lawful if and to the extent to which it represents legitimate scientific research. In this respect, the precautionary principle can be used to balance the risks arising out of scientific OIF activities for the marine environment with the potential advantages relevant to the objectives of the climate change regime. As scientific OIF experiments involve only comparatively small negative impacts within a limited marine area, further scientific research must be permitted to explore the carbon sequestration potential of OIF in order to either reject this concept or integrate it into the flexible mechanisms contained in the Kyoto Protocol.

"Economic prospects of ocean iron fertilization in an international carbon market","Rickels, W. and Rehdanz, K. and Oschlies, A.","2012","Resource And Energy Economics","Staying within the 2Â° C temperature increase target for climate change requires for ambitious emission reduction targets for the 2012-2020 compliance period. Cost-efficiency is a crucial criterion for the achievement of such targets, requiring analyses of all possible options. Enhancing the oceanic carbon sink via ocean iron fertilization (OIF) provides such an option. Our analysis reveals that the critical unit costs per net ton of CO 2 sequestered by OIF range from 22 to 28 USD (price level 2000) in a post-Kyoto compliance scenario. The critical unit costs are defined as those that would make an emitter indifferent between various abatement options. With reference to hypothetical short-term large-scale Southern Ocean OIF we are able to show that seven years of OIF provide a number of credits exceeding those obtainable from global forestation projects lasting 20 years. From an economic perspective, our results indicate that OIF can be considered a potentially viable carbon-removal option. However, further research is needed, especially on adverse side-effects and their ecological and economical consequences. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.",NA,"2012.603","selected",""
"Casting a Wider Net on Ocean NETs","Cox, E. and Boettcher, M. and Spence, E. and Bellamy, R.","2021","Frontiers In Climate","Societal issues involving policies and publics are generally understudied in research on ocean-based Negative Emission Technologies (NETs), yet will be crucial if novel techniques are ever to function at scale. Public attitudes are vital for emerging technologies: publics influence political mandates, help determine the degree of uptake by market actors, and are key to realizing broader ambitions for robust decision-making and responsible incentivization. Discourses surrounding ocean NETs will also have fundamental effects on how governance for the techniques emerges, shaping how they are defined as an object of governance, who is assigned the authority to govern, and what instruments are deemed appropriate. This Perspective brings together key insights on the societal dimensions of ocean NETs, drawing on existing work on public acceptability, policy assessment, governance, and discourse. Ocean iron fertilization is the only ocean NET on which there exists considerable social science research thus far, and we show that much evidence points against its social desirability. Taken in conjunction with considerable natural science uncertainties, this leads us to question whether further research is actually necessary in order to rule out ocean iron fertilization as an option. For other ocean NETs, there is a need for further research into social dimensions, yet research on analogous technologies shows that ocean interventions will likely evoke strong risk perceptions, and evidence suggests that the majority of ocean NETs may face a greater public acceptability challenge than terrestrial NETs. Ocean NETs also raise complex challenges around governance, which pose questions well-beyond the remit of the natural sciences and engineering. Using a conceptual exploration of the ways in which different types of discourse may shape emerging ocean NETs governance, we show that the very idea of ocean NETs is likely to set the stage for a whole new range of contested futures.

"Effects of operating parameters and injection method on the performance of an artificial upwelling by using airlift pump","Qiang, Yongfa and Fan, Wei and Xiao, Canbo and Pan, Yiwen and Chen, Ying","2018","Applied Ocean Research","Artificial upwelling by using airlift pump is considered a sustainable way in actualizing ocean fertilization, which could potentially alleviate the pressures on the fish stocks and human-driven climate change. However, few experimental data about the effects of operating parameters and injection method on the performance of the airlift artificial upwelling were found in the literature. In this paper, an airlift pump for artificial upwelling was investigated through three field experiments, in which airlift pumps of pipe length ranges from 20 to 28.3 m and pipe diameter ranges from 0.4 to 2 m, were designed and tested. Pumped water flow rate and injected air flow rate were measured to study the effects of different factors on the performance of airlift pump. The experiment results show that airlift pump efficiency is closely related to pipe diameter, submerged depth, submergence ratio and nozzle designs. There is no best nozzle for all the range of air flow rate, and the recommended nozzles are double-ring-shaped or star-shaped nozzles when the air flow rate is less or more than 220 L/min, respectively. Moreover, the lift effectiveness increases when the hole size of nozzle is enlarged, which indicates a relatively large bubble size will enhance the lift effectiveness.","Engineering; Oceanography","2018.3958","selected",""

Ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is a geoengineering strategy aimed at mitigating global warming through human intervention. The OIF concept is based on the idea that artificial adding of iron nutrients into iron-depleted regions of the ocean will lead to a rapid boost of phytoplankton populations and the mass sinking of organic matter that ultimately leads to the sequestration of significant amounts of atmospheric CO2 in the deep sea and sediments. The OIF experiments have been conducted in past over the time and the space scales of weeks and kilometres in polar, subpolar and tropical areas of the oceans. The results have generated new knowledge and a better understanding of the role of iron in regulating marine ecosystems and have confirmed that the iron supply is one of the key controls on the dynamics of phytoplankton blooms, such as diatom as the base of the marine food chain, which in turn affect the whole biogeochemical cycling of carbon. However, the OIF as an effective carbon control strategy is not adequately supported with concerns about potential significant impacts on marine ecosystems. The iron fertilization also did not significantly strengthen the vertical carbon export to the deep sea and thereby the sequestration of CO2. The efficacy by which the OIF vertically exports organic carbon associated with diatom blooms to the deep sea remains constrained due to the remineralization and the loss of organic carbon during the sinking process of diatomaceous biogenic silica (BSi). Therefore, to address these limitations, the next generation of the IOF geoengineering experiments should be designed to improve the low efficiency of the vertical export of bloomed phytoplankton, which will reduce the loss of organic carbon during the sinking of biomass. In our recent studies, we observed a noticeable dissolution-inhibition effect of Al-bearing lake diatomaceous BSi, which is caused by the high content of Al incorporation in the structure of the BSi. This finding inspired a new idea about the possibility of incorporating naturally occurring, environmentally safe and Al-rich minerals as an Al source for the geoengineering experiments. We hypothesize that clay minerals, with characteristically high contents of Al and Si, might be good ingredients for mineral fertilization in geoengineering experiments to enhance the efficiency of the vertical carbon export of the biological pump. This new proposed mineral-aided process is termed mineral-enhanced biological pump (MeBP). In this paper, the concept, background and theoretical basis of MeBP for CO2 sequestration in water bodies as a new and inexpensive geoengineering strategy are explained. The basic idea of the MeBP concept is to use finely grained powders of minerals, such as clay minerals as nutrients for geoengineering or ecological engineering experiment to enhance the efficiency of the complexes of microbial organic matter and minerals and to hinder the loss of particulate organic carbon by adjusting the mineral ratios and regulating the particle properties. If so, the improved carbon sequestration efficiency of the biological pump and the CO2 sink enhancement in water bodies could be achieved. The MeBP offers several potential advantages such as application simplicity, low-cost, scalability, environmental friendliness, and flexibility, and it could be applied alone or in combination with other carbon sequestration strategies. Also, the approaches for the research and application of MeBP, the environmental and ecological risks of applying MeBP and the possible ways of avoiding these risks are discussed. These discussions aim to stimulate new thinking toward the development of new technologies of increasing carbon sink in water bodies that are sustainable, ecologically acceptable and scalable, and can be translated into real applications and engineering practices.

"The Ultimate Ocean Ranch","Matsuda, F and Tsurutani, T and Szyper, JP and Takahashi, P","1998","NANA","Significant expansion of global food supply will require new advancements of similar impact to the Green Revolution. The Ultimate Ocean Ranch envisions enhancement of open-sea biological productivity through artificial upwelling of deep-ocean nutrients by means of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC); food products will be derived by management of integrated ``floating grazing platforms,{''} which could also enhance atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration and net oxygen production in the photic zone. Some of the required technologies exist; some must be developed. Commercialization of the concept will be required; this in turn will require the fullest possible integration of value-generating activities. We estimate, from typical ecological parameters and from some assumptions that can only be evaluated through research, that about \$ 3.3 M in aquatic food products could be produced annually from the water-pumping capability of a hypothetical 10-MW OTEC plant. This is not a large return on investment, but it precedes research and engineering development; other values will be generated. The urgency of the food problem and the lack of nullifying obstacles indicates further evaluation of this concept.","Acoustics; Engineering; Instruments \& Instrumentation","1998.938","selected",""
"Enhancing fish stocks with wave-powered artificial upwelling","Kirke, B.","2003","Ocean And Coastal Management","Ocean fisheries are declining worldwide due to overexploitation. Productivity could be enhanced and the problem alleviated by pumping nutrient-rich deep ocean water (DOW) to the surface to feed phytoplankton, the bottom end of a marine food chain, mimicking natural upwelling which sustains the most productive ocean fishing grounds in the world. Various pump types and power sources have been proposed for this purpose. The present article proposes a simple wave-powered pump to demonstrate the concept cost-effectively at prototype scale. Possible solutions to the problems of dilution and plunging of dense, nutrient-rich DOW are discussed. Two further possible benefits of this proposal are discussed: by extracting wave energy, relatively calm fishing grounds may be created close to markets, and by pumping up very large quantities of cold DOW, the surface temperature could be lowered enough to reduce coral bleaching on parts of the Great Barrier Reef.

Theoretically ocean fertilization promises great benefits but there is also the possibility of serious environmental damage to consider. The nature of ocean urea fertilization means it is more likely to be carried out in coastal waters, providing States with different powers to enforce their laws compared to ocean iron fertilization which is more suitable to waters beyond national jurisdiction. This paper considers the process and effect urea, when used for the purpose of ocean fertilization, may have on the marine environment as well as the social implications, particularly for coastal and island people in developing nations.

Various approaches have been proposed to reduce atmospheric CO2. The Martin (or iron) hypothesis suggests that ocean iron fertilization (OIF) could be an effective method for stimulating oceanic carbon sequestration through the biological pump in iron-limited, high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions. To test the Martin hypothesis, 13 artificial OIF (aOIF) experiments have been performed since 1990 in HNLC regions. These aOIF field experiments have demonstrated that primary production (PP) can be significantly enhanced by the artificial addition of iron. However, except in the Southern Ocean (SO) European Iron Fertilization Experiment (EIFEX), no significant change in the effectiveness of aOIF (i.e., the amount of iron-induced carbon export flux below the winter mixed layer depth, MLD) has been detected. These results, including possible side effects, have been debated amongst those who support and oppose aOIF experimentation, and many questions concerning the effectiveness of scientific aOIF, environmental side effects, and international aOIF law frameworks remain. In the context of increasing global and political concerns associated with climate change, it is valuable to examine the validity and usefulness of the aOIF experiments. Furthermore, it is logical to carry out such experiments because they allow one to study how plankton-based ecosystems work by providing insight into mechanisms operating in real time and under in situ conditions. To maximize the effectiveness of aOIF experiments under international aOIF regulations in the future, we therefore suggest a design that incorporates several components. (1) Experiments conducted in the center of an eddy structure when grazing pressure is low and silicate levels are high (e.g., in the SO south of the polar front during early summer) (2) Shipboard observations extending over a minimum of similar to 40 days, with multiple iron injections (at least two or three iron infusions of similar to 2000 kg with an interval of similar to 10-15 days to fertilize a patch of 300 km(2) and obtain a similar to 2 nM concentration). (3) Tracing of the iron-fertilized patch using both physical (e.g., a drifting buoy) and biogeochemical (e.g., sulfur hexafluoride, photosynthetic quantum efficiency, and partial pressure of CO2) tracers. (4) Employment of neutrally buoyant sediment traps (NBST) and application of the water-column-derived thorium-234 (Th-234) method at two depths (i.e., just below the in situ MLD and at the winter MLD), with autonomous profilers equipped with an underwater video profiler (UVP) and a transmissometer. (5) Monitoring of side effects on marine/ocean ecosystems, including production of climate-relevant gases (e.g., nitrous oxide, N2O; dimethyl sulfide, DMS; and halogenated volatile organic compounds, HVOCs), decline in oxygen inventory, and development of toxic algae blooms, with optical-sensor-equipped autonomous moored profilers and/or autonomous benthic vehicles.

Isaacs proposed to use wave energy to invert the density structure of the ocean and pump deep, nutrient-rich water into the sunlit surface layers. The basic principle is simple: a length of tubing attached to a surface buoy at the top, and a one-way valve at the bottom can be extended below the euphotic zone to act as a conduit for deep water. The vertical motion of the ocean forces the attached valve to open on the downslope of a wave and close on the upslope, thus generating upward movement of deep water to the surface ocean. Although Isaacs's wave-powered pump has taken many forms, from energy production to aquaculture to the more recent suggestion that artificial upwelling could be used to stimulate primary productivity and carbon sequestration, the simple engineering concept remains the same. In June 2008, the authors tested a commercially available wave pump (Atmocean) north of Oahu, Hawaii, to assess the logistics of at-sea deployment and the durability of the equipment under open ocean conditions. This test was done as part of an experiment designed to evaluate a recently published hypothesis that upwelling of water containing excess phosphate (P) relative to nitrogen (N) compared to the canonical ""Redfield"" molar ratio of 16N:1P would generate a two-phased phytoplankton bloom. The end result of this field experiment was rapid delivery (&lt;2 h for a 300-m transit) of deep water to the surface ocean followed by catastrophic failure of pump materials under the dynamic stresses of the oceanic environment. Wave-driven upwelling of cold water was documented for a period of ~17 h, with a volumetric upwelling rate of ~45 m3 h-1 and an estimated total input of 765 m3 of nutrient-enriched deep water.

We then examine the application of the international legal regime on climate change to ocean fertilization and assess the international legal basis for the sale of carbon offsets or carbon credits associated with ocean fertilization. We conclude that ocean fertilization is governed by the dumping regime and that its commercialization is inconsistent with international law unless and until independent, internationally peer-reviewed scientific research and assessment demonstrates that it is effective and that its benefits outweigh the risks to the marine environment.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","2008.184","selected",""

"Climate change, ocean processes and ocean iron fertilization","Denman, Kenneth L.","2008","Marine Ecology Progress Series","Observations indicate that the rate of increase in concentration of atmospheric CO2 is increasing faster than projected in any of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios. Several mitigation measures, referred to as `geoengineering options', have been proposed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. To be successful, such a mitigation operation must remove `significant' CO2 from the atmosphere for many decades, be verifiable, and not cause deleterious side effects. One option, purposeful addition of iron to fertilize photosynthetic uptake Of CO2 by phytoplankton in regions of the ocean where iron is a limiting nutrient, has received considerable scientific attention. In the last 15 yr, a dozen small-scale open ocean iron fertilization experiments have been performed and a succession of models of large-scale fertilization have been developed. As successive models have become more realistic, the amounts Of CO2 forecast to be sequestered have dropped, and in all cases are small relative to the amounts Of CO2 projected to be released through fossil fuel burning over the next century for any of the IPCC emission scenarios. Possible side effects include a long term reduction in ocean productivity, alteration of the structure of marine food webs, and a more rapid increase in ocean acidity. Most importantly, increased remineralization associated with the increased downward export of organic carbon particles would result: in increased production of the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas, N2O. The magnitude of this effect is poorly known.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","2008.385","selected",""
