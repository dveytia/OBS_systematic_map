"Ecological states and the resilience of coral reefs","McClanahan, T and Polunin, N and Done, T","2002","Conservation Ecology","We review the evidence for multiple ecological states and the factors that create ecological resilience in coral reef ecosystems. There are natural differences among benthic communities along gradients of water temperature, light, nutrients, and organic matter associated with upwelling-downwelling and onshore-offshore systems. Along gradients from oligotrophy to eutrophy, plant-animal symbioses tend to decrease, and the abundance of algae and heterotrophic suspension feeders and the ratio of organic to inorganic carbon production tend to increase. Human influences such as fishing, increased organic matter and nutrients, sediments, warm water, and transportation of xenobiotics and diseases are common causes of a large number of recently reported ecological shifts. It is often the interaction of persistent and multiple synergistic disturbances that causes permanent ecological transitions, rather than the succession of individual short-term disturbances. For example, fishing can remove top-level predators, resulting in the ecological release of prey such as sea urchins and coral-eating invertebrates. When sea urchins are not common because of unsuitable habitat, recruitment limitations, and diseases, and when overfishing removes herbivorous fish, frondose brown algae can dominate. Terrigenous sediments carried onto reefs as a result of increased soil erosion largely promote the dominance of turf or articulated green algae. Elevated nutrients and organic matter can increase internal eroders of reef substratum and a mixture of filamentous algae. Local conservation actions that attempt to reduce fishing and terrestrial influences promote the high production of inorganic carbon that is necessary for reef growth. However, global climate change threatens to undermine such actions because of increased bleaching and mortality caused by warm-water anomalies, weakened coral skeletons caused by reduced aragonite availability in reef waters, and increased incidence of diseases in coral reef species. Consequently, many coral reefs, including those that are heavily managed, have experienced net losses in accumulated inorganic carbon in recent decades and appear likely to continue this trend in coming decades. Reefs urgently need to be managed with a view to strengthening their resilience to the increased frequency and intensity of these pressures. Ecological targets must include the restoration or maintenance of species diversity, keystone species, spatial heterogeneity, refugia, and connectivity. Achieving these goals will require unprecedented cooperative synergy between human organizations at all political levels, from intergovernmental to local.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2002.1015","selected",""
"Connectivity, biodiversity conservation and the design of marine reserve networks for coral reefs","Almany, G. R. and Connolly, S. R. and Heath, D. D. and Hogan, J. D. and Jones, G. P. and McCook, L. J. and Mills, M. and Pressey, R. L. and Williamson, D. H.","2009","Coral Reefs","Networks of no-take reserves are important for protecting coral reef biodiversity from climate change and other human impacts. Ensuring that reserve populations are connected to each other and non-reserve populations by larval dispersal allows for recovery from disturbance and is a key aspect of resilience. In general, connectivity between reserves should increase as the distance between them decreases. However, enhancing connectivity may often tradeoff against a network's ability to representatively sample the system's natural variability. This ``representation{''} objective is typically measured in terms of species richness or diversity of habitats, but has other important elements (e.g., minimizing the risk that multiple reserves will be impacted by catastrophic events). Such representation objectives tend to be better achieved as reserves become more widely spaced. Thus, optimizing the location, size and spacing of reserves requires both an understanding of larval dispersal and explicit consideration of how well the network represents the broader system; indeed the lack of an integrated theory for optimizing tradeoffs between connectivity and representation objectives has inhibited the incorporation of connectivity into reserve selection algorithms. This article addresses these issues by (1) updating general recommendations for the location, size and spacing of reserves based on emerging data on larval dispersal in corals and reef fishes, and on considerations for maintaining genetic diversity; (2) using a spatial analysis of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to examine potential tradeoffs between connectivity and representation of biodiversity and (3) describing a framework for incorporating environmental fluctuations into the conceptualization of the tradeoff between connectivity and representation, and that expresses both in a common, demographically meaningful currency, thus making optimization possible.","Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2009.4801","selected",""
"The Genetic Component of Seagrass Restoration: What We Know and the Way Forwards","Pazzaglia, Jessica and Nguyen, Hung Manh and Santillan-Sarmiento, Alex and Ruocco, Miriam and Dattolo, Emanuela and Marin-Guirao, Lazaro and Procaccini, Gabriele","2021","Water","Seagrasses are marine flowering plants providing key ecological services and functions in coasts and estuaries across the globe. Increased environmental changes fueled by human activities are affecting their existence, compromising natural habitats and ecosystems' biodiversity and functioning. In this context, restoration of disturbed seagrass environments has become a worldwide priority to reverse ecosystem degradation and to recover ecosystem functionality and associated services. Despite the proven importance of genetic research to perform successful restoration projects, this aspect has often been overlooked in seagrass restoration. Here, we aimed to provide a comprehensive perspective of genetic aspects related to seagrass restoration. To this end, we first reviewed the importance of studying the genetic diversity and population structure of target seagrass populations; then, we discussed the pros and cons of different approaches used to restore and/or reinforce degraded populations. In general, the collection of genetic information and the development of connectivity maps are critical steps for any seagrass restoration activity. Traditionally, the selection of donor population preferred the use of local gene pools, thought to be the best adapted to current conditions. However, in the face of rapid ocean changes, alternative approaches such as the use of climate-adjusted or admixture genotypes might provide more sustainable options to secure the survival of restored meadows. Also, we discussed different transplantation strategies applied in seagrasses and emphasized the importance of long-term seagrass monitoring in restoration. The newly developed information on epigenetics as well as the application of assisted evolution strategies were also explored. Finally, a view of legal and ethical issues related to national and international restoration management is included, highlighting improvements and potential new directions to integrate with the genetic assessment. We concluded that a good restoration effort should incorporate: (1) a good understanding of the genetic structure of both donors and populations being restored; (2) the analysis of local environmental conditions and disturbances that affect the site to be restored; (3) the analysis of local adaptation constraints influencing the performances of donor populations and native plants; (4) the integration of distribution/connectivity maps with genetic information and environmental factors relative to the target seagrass populations; (5) the planning of long-term monitoring programs to assess the performance of the restored populations. The inclusion of epigenetic knowledge and the development of assisted evolution programs are strongly hoped for the future.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Water Resources","2021.6009","selected",""
"Eco-engineering and management strategies for marine infrastructure to reduce establishment and dispersal of non-indigenous species","Dafforn, Katherine A.","2017","Management Of Biological Invasions","Habitat modification and the introduction and establishment of non-indigenous species (NIS) are two of the greatest threats to global biodiversity. Human modifications of marine habitats include the introduction of boating infrastructure, coastal defences and offshore energy installations that are occurring at an increasing rate. These artificial structures are now widely recognised as providing opportunities for the establishment and dispersal of non-indigenous fouling species in new regions. This is driving increased interest into how structures might be designed and built to limit their suitability for invasive species. At the same time the potential for artificial habitats to provide habitat to native and threatened species means that the control of NIS on these structures should not just rely on antifouling. Green or eco-engineering aims to incorporate ecological theory and principles into the design of engineered structures. When combined with other management strategies that aim to increase the resistance of recipient environments there is the potential to enhance practical barriers against invaders in an increasingly developed ocean. Here I explore examples of NIS facilitation by artificial structures and the ecological theories that could be used to reduce opportunities for NIS establishment and spread. Examples include (1) manipulating the physical and chemical properties of structures to enhance native recruitment over NIS, (2) enhancing resource use of structures by native species through ``pre-seeding{''}, (3) providing opportunities for native grazers and predators to easily access structures, and (4) considering the timing of construction/maintenance/decommissioning for artificial structures such that resources are not made available when propagule pressure is also high. These examples are not exhaustive, but rather provide a discussion point for managers of biological invasions to generate further research and application over larger spatial scales.","Biodiversity \& Conservation","2017.12763","selected",""
"Biotic homogenization increases with human intervention: implications for mangrove wetland restoration","Zhang, Yamian and Zhang, Lin and Kang, Yiyang and Li, Yuanxi and Chen, Zilong and Li, Rong and Tian, Changqing and Wang, Wenqing and Wang, Mao","2022","Ecography","The large-scale conversion of natural mangroves to aquaculture reduces species richness and diversity. Large areas of abandoned aquaculture ponds in areas where mangroves formerly predominated in China and southeast Asia represent important potential effective targets for mangrove restoration. Here, we empirically assessed the alpha-diversity (species richness) and beta-diversity (variation in community composition) of mangrove, macrobenthos, fish and waterbird in a tropical mangrove bay on Hainan Island, China. We compared sites subjected to different pond-to-mangrove restoration programs more than 20 years ago (passive restoration without planting and active restoration with planting) to nearby reference site with natural mangrove forests and mudflats. To better understand how beta-diversity responds to restoration, we also distinguished between beta-diversity turnover and nestedness (richness difference). In general, alpha-diversity values for both fish and waterbird communities and beta-diversity values for the mangrove, macrobenthos and waterbird communities were lower at the restoration sites than at the reference site, suggesting that the strong homogenizing effects of anthropogenic habitat alternation were still apparent after more than 20 years since aquaculture ceased. In addition, spatial turnover, not nestedness, dominated total beta-diversity both across the whole study area and at individual sites, suggesting that multiple processes, such as environmental filtering, helped to shape multi-taxa community structures. Moreover, we found no evidence that planting in the abandoned ponds, in addition to standard hydrological restoration, supported greater species diversity of taxa like macrobenthos and waterbird than the naturally regenerated site after more than 20 years' recovery. Our results underline the importance of avoiding the conversion of natural mangrove stands to aquaculture wherever possible and the urgent need to design effective mangrove restoration techniques in tropical Asia.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2022.6293","excluded",""
"Restoring oysters to urban estuaries: Redefining habitat quality for eastern oyster performance near New York City","McFarland, Katherine and Hare, Matthew P.","2018","Plos One","Restoring and conserving coastal resilience faces increasing challenges under current climate change predictions. Oyster restoration, in particular, faces threats from alterations in precipitation, warming water temperatures, and urbanization of coastlines that dramatically change salinity patterns, foster the proliferation and spread disease, and disrupt habitat connectivity, respectively. New York City (NYC) coastal waters, once home to a booming oyster fishery for eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), are now nearly devoid of live oyster reefs. Oyster restoration in urban estuaries is motivated by the synergistic ecosystem benefits this native keystone species can deliver. Recent surveys have documented substantial remnant populations of adult oysters in the upper low salinity zone of the Hudson/Raritan Estuary (HRE) near Tarrytown, NY. This study assessed fitness-related performance across the HRE salinity gradient to evaluate habitat suitability on an estuarine scale. Oysters were hatchery-produced from wild, moderate-salinity broodstock, then outplanted for measurement of growth, survival, reproduction and disease prevalence over two years. Survival was generally higher in the lower salinity river sites and in the higher salinity Jamaica Bay sites relative to mesohaline NYC harbor sites. Growth rate was highest in Jamaica Bay and had high variation among other sites. Surprisingly, the highest proportion of individuals with sex-differentiated gametes and the highest average gonad maturation index was found at a low salinity site. Consistent with the advanced gametogenesis measured in experimental animals at low salinity, annual wild recruitment was documented near the low salinity remnant population in each of five monitored years. These results suggest that the remnant HRE oyster population is a robust, self-sustaining population that can be leveraged to support restoration of subpopulations in other parts of the estuary, but further research is required to determine if the mesohaline and near-ocean reaches of the HRE can support the full oyster life cycle.","Science \& Technology - Other Topics","2018.6093","selected",""
"Comparing management strategies for conserving communities of climate-threatened species with a stochastic metacommunity model","Backus, Gregory A. and Huang, Yansong and Baskett, Marissa L.","2022","Philosophical Transactions Of The Royal Society B-biological Sciences","Many species are shifting their ranges to keep pace with climate change, but habitat fragmentation and limited dispersal could impede these range shifts. In the case of climate-vulnerable foundation species such as tropical reef corals and temperate forest trees, such limitations might put entire communities at risk of extinction. Restoring connectivity through corridors, stepping-stones or enhanced quality of existing patches could prevent the extinction of several species, but dispersal-limited species might not benefit if other species block their dispersal. Alternatively, managers might relocate vulnerable species between habitats through assisted migration, but this is generally a species-by-species approach. To evaluate the relative efficacy of these strategies, we simulated the climate-tracking of species in randomized competitive metacommunities with alternative management interventions. We found that corridors and assisted migration were the most effective strategies at reducing extinction. Assisted migration was especially effective at reducing the extinction likelihood for short-dispersing species, but it often required moving several species repeatedly. Assisted migration was more effective at reducing extinction in environments with higher stochasticity, and corridors were more effective at reducing extinction in environments with lower stochasticity. We discuss the application of these approaches to an array of systems ranging from tropical corals to temperate forests.This article is part of the theme issue `Ecological complexity and the biosphere: the next 30 years'.","Life Sciences \& Biomedicine - Other Topics","2022.6199","selected",""
"Theories and research advances of restoration ecology","Ren, H. and Wang, J. and Lu, H.","2014","Shengtai Xuebao","The natural ecosystems continue to face degradation and damage under human and natural disturbance. Thus, the societal demand for ecosystem restoration is rapidly increasing. Ecological restoration is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed. Restoration ecology is the field of science that studies the process of ecological restoration. As a young academic feld, the conceptual framework of restoration ecology has been developed rapidly by integrating theory and practice over the past two decades. The present state of restoration ecology is still far away from Bradshawâ€™s â€œacid test for ecology.- This review briefly introduces the theories and advances on restoration ecology. The major principles of restoration ecology, which are heavily based on contemporary ecology theories, include interaction among ecological factors, competition, niches, succession, recruitment limitation, facilitation, mutualisms, herbivory or predation, disturbance, genetic diversity, island biogeography, ecosystem function and biodiversity, plant-soil feedback, ecotypes, landscape heterogeneity, and scale, among others. The emerging theories from the practice of restoration ecology include the state and transition model, assembly rules, reference ecosystem, self-design and designer-design, and adaptive restoration. Moreover, the review also reports the research advances and mainstream-recognition of restoration ecology from the perspectives of habitat, population, community, ecosystem, landscape, global change and anthropogenic disturbances. Restoration ecology has shifted from static, single state, structure-based, individual ecosystem to dynamic, multi-state, process-oriented, and landscape context. However, there are two major obstacles in the development of restoration ecology: (1) It still adopts simple experiments with few treatment factors and few levels of those factors, and (2) It focuses little on synthesis and has weak conceptual theory. Therefore, restoration ecology is facing two paradigm shifting: uniting the practice with the theories, and uniting science with arts (including social, economic, cultural, and political factors). The research hotspots in restoration ecology include: the mechanism and assessment on ecosystem degradation from the perspective of ecosystem, the non-biological and biological barriers to the process of recovery, the temporal and spatial dynamics of key processes (for example, pollination, dispersal, fire, nutrient cycling, etc.) during restoration, the irreversible threshold and nonlinearity in ecological restoration and degradation, the interactions between species, the role of ""mysterious"" biota (e.g., fungi, rhizobium, soil protozoa, etc.) during recovery, biological invasions, and biological connectivity during the restoration, the interaction mechanism between above ground and below ground linkages, the role of plant-soil feedbacks in driving native-species recovery and multi-trophic interactions, heterogeneity restoration on landscape scale, the ecological restoration in ecotones, the restoration of natural capital, ecosystem services and restoration products, carbon sequestration and forest restoration, native vegetation and nutrient management during the restoration design, identification of effective invention practices and prediction of ecosystem recovery, ecological restoration under climate change, and economic processes of ecological restoration. In addition, restoration ecology is becoming increasingly and closely linked with the urgent ecological, economic, and political issues such as the C emissions, loss of biodiversity, and payments for ecosystem services. Restoration ecology in the future should link or combine theory and practice effectively, adopt a multidisciplinary approach by integrating the natural sciences and the humanities in the social, economic, cultural, political, technology and other factors to ultimately achieve sustainable development.

"Combined effects of ocean warming and acidification on marine fish and shellfish: A molecule to ecosystem perspective","Baag, Sritama and Mandal, Sumit","2022","Science Of The Total Environment","It is expected that by 2050 human population will exceed nine billion leading to increased pressure on marine ecosystems. Therefore, it is conjectured various levels of ecosystem functioning starting from individual to population-level, species distribution, food webs and trophic interaction dynamics will be severely jeopardized in coming decades. Ocean warming and acidification are two prime threats to marine biota, yet studies about their cumulative effect on marine fish and shellfishes are still in its infancy. This review assesses existing information regarding the interactive effects of global environmental factors like warming and acidification in the perspective of marine capture fisheries and aquaculture industry. As climate change continues, distribution pattern of species is likely to be altered which will impact fisheries and fishing patterns. Our work is an attempt to compile the existing literatures in the biological perspective of the above-mentioned stressors and accentuate a clear outline of knowledge in this subject. We reviewed studies deciphering the biological consequences of warming and acidification on fish and shellfishes in the light of a molecule to ecosystem perspective. Here, for the first time impacts of these two global environmental drivers are discussed in a holistic manner taking into account growth, survival, behavioural response, prey predator dynamics, calcification, biomineralization, reproduction, physiology, thermal tolerance, molecular level responses as well as immune system and disease susceptibility. We suggest urgent focus on more robust, long term, comprehensive and ecologically realistic studies that will significantly contribute to the understanding of organism's response to climate change for sustainable capture fisheries and aquaculture.

However, previous studies ignored the importance of genetic diversity, which restricted our comprehensive understanding of the effects of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functions. Here, we manipulated different richness levels with litters of eight common species of coastal wetland plants and eight different genotypes of common reed (Phragmites australis) to explore the effects of species and genetic diversity on litter decomposition. We found the litter mass loss of mixtures was significantly lower than the average mass loss of single litters (ANOVA, p < 0.05), suggesting higher species and genetic diversity had negative effects on plant litter decomposition. The negative effects were also supported by the t-test that the observed mass loss was significantly lower than expected at both species and genetic diversity levels, which also identified that antagonistic effects occurred. In addition, the functional diversity of initial litter qualities, such as lignin content and the C/P ratio, had a significant correlation with the negative effects at species and genetic levels, whereas phylogenetic diversity did not reveal such a correlation, implying functional diversity might better predict the effects of diversity changes on litter decomposition in coastal wetlands at both species and genetic levels. Furthermore, the presence of specific species or genotype litters, such as Scorzonera mongolica, Imperata cylindrica and the common reed numbered CN2026, could also predict negative effects. In this study, we found that genetic diversity influenced litter decomposition as much as species diversity, and we provided significant implications for predicting the effect of wetland biodiversity loss or conservation on carbon sink capacity.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2022.2151",NA,""
"Best-practice fisheries management associated with reduced stocks and changes in life histories","McClanahan, Timothy R. and Friedlander, Alan M. and Wantiez, Laurent and Graham, Nick A. J. and Bruggemann, J. Henrich and Chabanet, Pascale and Oddenyo, Remy M.","2022","Fish And Fisheries","Current best-practice policy recommendations for managing fish stocks are achieved by a mixture of maintaining modest fishing mortality (restricting effort, times and gear), marine reserve networks and not subsidizing unprofitable fisheries. A seldom evaluated question is how effective these proposed approaches are for maintaining all fish stocks and biodiversity elements in marine seascapes? Both recommended and unrecommended fishing practices fragment habitats and reduce metapopulation connectivity with potentially unexpected seascape-level consequences. To better understand these outcomes, we pooled and evaluated fish community data into two seascape groupings for comparisons of biomass and life-history characteristics. These were remote baseline reefs (>9 hr from regional cities and >4 hr from human habitation, n = 584 locations) and those emulating best-practice seascapes (BPS, n = 140). BPS were a mix of high-compliance marine reserves (fishable biomass = 892 +/- 696 (+/- SD) kg/ha, n = 95; >5 km(2) and >15 years of closure) and fished seascapes (478 +/- 395 kg/ha, n = 45) that had biomass near the maximum sustained yield (MSY) estimates for coral reefs. The fish communities in the BPS locations differed considerably from the remote baseline by having 49\% of the median and 32\% of the mean biomass, smaller community-weighted body sizes, and faster growth and mortality rates. Most of the declines were associated with high biomass taxa that included carnivorous jacks (Carangidae), snappers (Lutjanidae), groupers (Serranidae) and triggerfish (Balistidae), which were reduced to between 11\% and 28\% of the mean baseline. Surgeonfish (Acanthuridae) and parrotfish (Scarinae) were an exception in being reduced to only 48 and 53\% of the baseline's mean biomass, respectively. As expected, community-level body sizes and age values were larger and trophic level higher, while growth and mortality were lower in baselines than BPS seascapes. After evaluating the different environmental responses between seascapes and accounting for the largest geographic factor, longitude, we evaluated the community responses to 4 possible BPS planning scenarios. Biomass responses to age and trophic level and length at maturity were similar and predictable for the two seascapes. In contrast, growth and generation time responses differed between seascapes. Baselines had peak biomass patterns at intermediate values, whereas BPS displayed a declining influence of growth and a saturating response for generation time. Consequently, deviations between BPS and baselines indicate that current BPS proposals do not fully emulate the ecology of remote or wilderness locations. Therefore, wilderness will be a required management designation if the global fish communities are to be fully conserved.","Fisheries","2022.8085","excluded",""

Here, targeting a key species in the Mediterranean coralligenous, the red coral, Corallium rubrum, in an emblematic Mediterranean MPA, the ``Reserve Naturelle de Scandola{''} (France), we applied demo-genetic approaches at two contrasted spatial scales, among populations and within one population, to (i) infer the demographic connectivity among populations in the metapopulation network and (ii) shed new light on the genetic connectivity and on the demographic transitions underlying the dynamics of a near-pristine population. Integrating different spatial and temporal scales, we demonstrated (i) an apparent temporal stability in the pattern of genetic diversity and structure in the MPA in spite of a dramatic demographic decline and (ii) contrasted levels of genetic isolation but substantial demographic connectivity among populations. Focusing on the near-pristine population, we complemented the characterization of red coral demographic connectivity suggesting (iii) temporal variability and (iv) the occurrence of collective dispersal. In addition, we demonstrated (v) contrasted patterns of spatial genetic structure (SGS), depending on the considered stage-class (adults vs. juveniles), in the near-pristine population. This last result points out that the overall SGS resulted from a restricted dispersal of locally produced juveniles (SGS among adults and juveniles) combined to mortality during early life stages (decrease of SGS from juveniles to adults).

Recent studies have demonstrated that this process causes shifts from algal forests to denuded non-canopy states in temperate reefs. It has been suggested that these changes would incur significant consequences to ecosystem functioning. In this study, we tested how tropicalization affects habitat-provisioning functions and carbon turnover of a shallow reef in the fast-warming and highly invaded southeastern Mediterranean Sea, in-situ. On a single shallow reef, we conducted measurements of these functions in three habitats: dwindling native brown algal (Cystoseira) forest, dominant turf (formed by overgrazing of tropical rabbitfish) and expanding tropical shrubs dominated by red calcifying algae (Galaxaura rugosa). Algal forest was an autotrophic net carbon sink and provided habitat for high species diversity and the largest community biomass. The denuded turf was heterotrophic and provided habitat for the lowest species diversity and community biomass. While diversity was as high in tropical shrubs as in the algal forest, it had lower biomass and functioned as a heterotrophic net carbon source. Synthesis. Our study exemplifies possible functional consequences of tropicalization-driven regime shifts on shallow temperate rocky reefs, and how these can invert the net trophic state and carbon balance.","Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2020.1895","selected",""

This is also driven by the increasing need to generate renewable energy. In most cases, this has resulted in a large number of man-made structures (MMSs) across several soft sediment environments. The nature of these structures ranges from oil and gas installations to harbour walls, anchored buoys, pipelines and offshore wind farms. These structures host fouling communities that are often new to offshore regions, potentially serving as stepping stones for range-expanding (non-indigenous) species and providing habitat and shelter for a variety of marine species. The altered local biodiversity also affects biological and biogeochemical processes from the water column to the seafloor, either directly (e.g. scouring, organic matter export from piles) or indirectly (e.g. closure or displacement of fisheries) and, hence, ecosystem functioning at various spatial and temporal scales.

We used genomics to design a restoration program for lost underwater forests ofPhyllospora comosa, a dominant forest-forming macroalga that went locally extinct from reefs off Sydney, Australia. Population genetic diversity and structure of nearby extant populations informed choice of donor sites. We tested whether donor provenance influenced adult transplant survival, condition (via metrics of epibiosis) and the genetic characteristics of recruits at restoration sites. Extant populations ofPhyllosporawithin a 100-km radius of Sydney comprised three distinct genetic clusters with similar levels of genetic diversity. We transplanted reproductive adults from two of these sites, with the aim of restoring fivePhyllosporaforests with levels of genetic structure and diversity similar to donor populations. Donor provenance influenced survival and condition of transplanted adults and recruitment levels varied significantly among restoration sites. Yet, recruitment was rapid and genetic diversity and structure of the F(1)generation resembled extant populations. This likely occurred because transplanted individuals reproduced synchronously and rapidly post-transplantation, prior to mortality of adult donor transplants. Synthesis and applications. As restoration and the need to `future-proof' marine ecosystems increase globally, it will be critical to understand and harness the role of donor provenance, genetic diversity and structure in restoration success. By incorporating ecological and genomic data into restoration design and assessment, this study demonstrates that evidence-based selection of macroalgal donors can result in F(1)generation recruits with similar levels of genetic diversity and structure as extant populations, despite an effect of provenance on transplant survival and condition. This study also highlights the need for ongoing refinement of transplantation techniques to ensure future recruitment success.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2020.12573","excluded",""

We review how ecological guidelines for improving marine reserve design can be adapted based on an area's unique evolutionary, oceanic, and ecological characteristics in the Gulf of California, Mexico. We provide ecological guidelines to maximize benefits for fisheries management, biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation. These guidelines include: representing 30\% of each major habitat (and multiple examples of each) in marine reserves within each of three biogeographic subregions; protecting critical areas in the life cycle of focal species (spawning and nursery areas) and sites with unique biodiversity; and establishing reserves in areas where local threats can be managed effectively. Given that strong, asymmetric oceanic currents reverse direction twice a year, to maximize connectivity on an ecological time scale, reserves should be spaced less than 50-200km apart depending on the planktonic larval duration of target species; and reserves should be located upstream of fishing sites, taking the reproductive timing of focal species in consideration. Reserves should be established for the long term, preferably permanently, since full recovery of all fisheries species is likely to take>25years. Reserve size should be based on movement patterns of focal species, although marine reserves>10km long are likely to protect80\% of fish species. Since climate change will affect species' geographic range, larval duration, growth, reproduction, abundance, and distribution of key recruitment habitats, these guidelines may require further modifications to maintain ecosystem function in the future.","Fisheries; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2018.152","selected",""
"Direct plant-plant facilitation in coastal wetlands: A review","Zhang, Liwen and Shao, Hongbo","2013","Estuarine Coastal And Shelf Science","Coastal wetlands provide important ecosystem services to humanity, but human activity and climate change are rapidly degrading these ecosystems. Thus the conservation and restoration of coastal wetlands becomes an urgent issue. Species facilitation among plants has regained attention of ecologists recently. Many studies in coastal wetlands have revealed direct plant-plant facilitation influencing community structure and ecosystem function, thus improving our understanding of community organization and giving new directions for the restoration of degraded coastal wetlands. Our paper examines studies of direct plant-plant facilitation in coastal wetlands with an emphasis on tests of the stress gradient hypothesis and influences of species facilitation on species zonation, species diversity patterns, phylogenetic diversity and ecosystem function. Investigating how plant-plant facilitation affects ecosystem function is an important future direction, which can provide basic knowledge applicable to the preservation and recovery of coastal wetlands in these times of rapid global change.
