"Nursery-propagated plants from seed: a novel tool to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of seagrass restoration","Balestri, Elena and Lardicci, Claudio","2012","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Seagrasses and the valuable ecosystem services they provide are threatened world-wide by impacts of human activity. Numerous revegetation efforts have attempted to restore seagrasses. Most restoration programmes use plants collected from the field because of limited seed availability, low seedling survival and difficulty in culturing plants. However, this practice risks damage to donor populations and has the potential to reduce genetic diversity, which may counteract the desired effects of restoration. A novel aquaculture system for producing plants (mother plants and cuttings) from a limited number of seeds was tested using Cymodocea nodosa as model species. The ability of transplanted cuttings to survive and grow in the natural habitat was also evaluated. Seed germination was high (48\%) compared with field conditions, and most seedlings produced mother plants with up to 7.8 m of rhizome and 300 shoots within 4 years in culture. All cuttings from mother plants regenerated new plants. Up to 100 transplants were produced from two seeds, and most (85\%) of them survived and initiated the colonization of substrate, 1 year after planting. Synthesis and applications. This study provides a robust protocol that can reduce plant and/or seed collection pressure on donor populations and produce a high number of transplants which show lower mortality rates during the early transplantation phases. This method can also help to preserve genetic diversity in restored populations, which should be one of the major goals of ecological restoration. This novel tool can be applied to other seagrass species with low or unpredictable reproductive success, therefore the development of nurseries should be incorporated in future restoration programmes. This is currently the only sustainable methodology to produce material for transplanting programmes for protected species.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2012.3684",NA,""
"Magnetic fields generated by the DC cables of offshore wind farms have no effect on spatial distribution or swimming behavior of lesser sandeel larvae (Ammodytes marinus)","Cresci, A. and Perrichon, P. and Durif, C.M.F. and SÃ¸rhus, E. and Johnsen, E. and Bjelland, R. and Larsen, T. and Skiftesvik, A.B. and Browman, H.I.","2022","Marine Environmental Research","In the North Sea, the number and size of offshore wind (OW) turbines, together with the associated network of High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) subsea cables, will increase rapidly over the coming years. HVDC cables produce magnetic fields (MFs) that might have an impact on marine animals that encounter them. One of the fish species that is at risk of exposure to MF associated with OW is the lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus), a keystone species of the North Sea basin. Lesser sandeel could be exposed to MF as larvae, when they drift in proximity of OW turbines. Whether MFs impact the behavior of lesser sandeel larvae, with possible downstream effects on their dispersal and survival, is unknown. We tested the behavior of 56 lesser sandeel larvae, using a setup designed to simulate the scenario of larvae drifting past a DC cable. We exposed the larvae to a MF intensity gradient (150-50 Î¼T) that is within the range of MFs produced by HVDC subsea cables. Exposure to the MF gradient did not affect the spatial distribution of lesser sandeel larvae in a raceway tank 50 cm long, 7 cm wide and 3.5 cm deep. Nor did the MF alter their swimming speed, acceleration or distance moved. These results show that static MF from DC cables would not impact behavior of lesser sandeel larvae during the larval period of their life although it does not exclude the possibility that later life stages could be affected.

"External conditions drive optimal planting configurations for salt marsh restoration","Duggan-Edwards, Mollie F. and Pages, Jordi F. and Jenkins, Stuart R. and Bouma, Tjeerd J. and Skov, Martin W.","2020","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Coastal salt marshes are threatened by erosion from storminess and sea level rise, with resulting losses in flood protection, wildlife and recreational space. Although more than \$1 billion has been spent to reconcile losses, restoration has had varying success because of poor survival of planted patches in challenging wave and current conditions. Marsh expansion after colonization or replanting is regulated by positive and negative feedbacks between vegetation density and sediment capture. Dense vegetation stimulates sediment capture and vertical patch growth, but negatively constrains patch expansion by concentrating hydrological energy into erosion gullies along patch edges. Conversely, low-density vegetation may not simulate enough sediment capture, which increases plant dislodgement mortality. The strengths of positive and negative feedbacks will vary with wave exposure, but this has never been tested in natural conditions. We observed density-dependent sediment feedbacks, survival and lateral expansion by Sporobolus anglicus patches (0.8 x 0.8 m) planted at three levels of vegetation density, at each of three levels of wave forcing (three sites). We found interactive effects of plant density and forcing on the strength of positive and negative feedbacks. Density-dependent feedbacks only emerged in moderate and exposed conditions: classic marsh tussock patch shapes, which arise due to combined positive (vertical growth) and negative (gullies) feedbacks, were only associated with high density vegetation under exposed conditions. At high exposure, survival was enhanced by dense planting, which diverted energy away from the vegetation. In sheltered conditions, expansion was the greatest at medium density, while dense patches had high mortality and erosion. Synthesis and applications. Success of wetland restoration clearly hinges on considering interactions between environmental stress and planting density. In challenging high-exposure settings, dense planting in large patches should maximize success, as plant facilitation boosts sediment capture and negative edge effects (gullies) will represent a diminished proportion of larger patches. Yet, benefits of dense planting will switch from positive (facilitation) to negative (competition) with reduced environmental stress, when moderate-density planting might be optimal. Switches along stress gradients between positive and negative feedbacks are common across ecosystems. We call for wider integration of facilitation and stress-gradient principles into restoration design to safeguard restoration successes.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2020.14053","selected",""
"Genome-wide analysis of natural and restored eastern oyster populations reveals local adaptation and positive impacts of planting frequency and broodstock number","Hornick, Katherine M. and Plough, V, Louis","2022","Evolutionary Applications","The release of captive-bred plants and animals has increased worldwide to augment declining species. However, insufficient attention has been given to understanding how neutral and adaptive genetic variation are partitioned within and among proximal natural populations, and the patterns and drivers of gene flow over small spatial scales, which can be important for restoration success. A seascape genomics approach was used to investigate population structure, local adaptation, and the extent to which environmental gradients influence genetic variation among natural and restored populations of Chesapeake Bay eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica. We also investigated the impact of hatchery practices on neutral genetic diversity of restored reefs and quantified the broader genetic impacts of large-scale hatchery-based bivalve restoration. Restored reefs showed similar levels of diversity as natural reefs, and striking relationships were found between planting frequency and broodstock numbers and genetic diversity metrics (effective population size and relatedness), suggesting that hatchery practices can have a major impact on diversity. Despite long-term restoration activities, haphazard historical translocations, and high dispersal potential of larvae that could homogenize allele frequencies among populations, moderate neutral population genetic structure was uncovered. Moreover, environmental factors, namely salinity, pH, and temperature, play a major role in the distribution of neutral and adaptive genetic variation. For marine invertebrates in heterogeneous seascapes, collecting broodstock from large populations experiencing similar environments to candidate sites may provide the most appropriate sources for restoration and ensure population resilience in the face of rapid environmental change. This is one of a few studies to demonstrate empirically that hatchery practices have a major impact on the retention of genetic diversity. Overall, these results contribute to the growing body of evidence for fine-scale genetic structure and local adaptation in broadcast-spawning marine species and provide novel information for the management of an important fisheries resource.","Evolutionary Biology","2022.6239","selected",""

L. and Hawkins, Stephen J. and Naylor, Larissa A. and Coleman, Ross A. and Chee, Su Yin and Dafforn, Katherine A.","2017","Journal Of Experimental Marine Biology And Ecology","The growing number of artificial structures in estuarine, coastal and marine environments is causing ``ocean sprawl{''}. Artificial structures do not only modify marine and coastal ecosystems at the sites of their placement, but may also produce larger-scale impacts through their alteration of ecological connectivity - the movement of organisms, materials and energy between habitat units within seascapes. Despite the growing awareness of the capacity of ocean sprawl to influence ecological connectivity, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how artificial structures modify ecological connectivity in near- and off-shore environments, and when and where their effects on connectivity are greatest. We review the mechanisms by which ocean sprawl may modify ecological connectivity, including trophic connectivity associated with the flow of nutrients and resources. We also review demonstrated, inferred and likely ecological impacts of such changes to connectivity, at scales from genes to ecosystems, and potential strategies of management for mitigating these effects. Ocean sprawl may alter connectivity by: (1) creating barriers to the movement of some organisms and resources - by adding physical barriers or by modifying and fragmenting habitats; (2) introducing new structural material that acts as a conduit for the movement of other organisms or resources across the landscape; and (3) altering trophic connectivity. Changes to connectivity may, in turn, influence the genetic structure and size of populations, the distribution of species, and community structure and ecological functioning. Two main approaches to the assessment of ecological connectivity have been taken: (1) measurement of structural connectivity - the configuration of the landscape and habitat patches and their dynamics; and (2) measurement of functional connectivity - the response of organisms or particles to the landscape. Our review reveals the paucity of studies directly addressing the effects of artificial structures on ecological connectivity in the marine environment, particularly at large spatial and temporal scales. With the ongoing development of estuarine and marine environments, there is a pressing need for additional studies that quantify the effects of ocean sprawl on ecological connectivity. Understanding the mechanisms by which structures modify connectivity is essential if marine spatial planning and eco-engineering are to be effectively utilised to minimise impacts.

"Taxonomic diversity and eco-exergy changes in fishery resources associated with artificial reefs over 14 years in Daya Bay, China","Yuan, Huarong and Chen, Pimao and Li, Xiaoguo","2022","Frontiers In Marine Science","Marine habitat degradation resulting from human activities and environmental pollution has led to serious deterioration of marine fishery resources. To address this issue, countries worldwide are exploring sustainable fishery approaches. Installation of artificial reefs (AR) is rapidly increasing. AR have been widely constructed globally to conserve fishery resources and improve marine habitats. As an important biological group of marine fishery resources, nekton are widely evaluated to determine the effects of ecological restoration and resource conservation. In the current study, we compared the dynamic properties of taxonomic diversity and the eco-exergy of nekton community from 2 to 14 years after AR construction in Dalajia, China. The results indicated that the species number and density of nekton significantly increased after AR construction. Siganus oramin became an absolute dominant fish species in the reef area and its surroundings. The species diversity and evenness of the nekton community decreased, whereas species richness increased. The abundance, biomass, and eco-exergy of the nekton community increased over time because of the dominance of fishes. Our results highlight that AR can increase and conserve fishery resources, improve the structure of the nekton community, and increase ecosystem stability. But, at the same time, the dominance of S. oramin can interfere in the reef community. The explosive growth was quantitatively and qualitatively higher than that of other species, the diversity and evenness indices showed a decreasing trend, although the number of nekton species was significantly higher than that in the background survey and CA habitat during the same period.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2022.10194",NA,""
"The thermal impacts of beach nourishment across a regionally important loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) rookery","Shamblott, Kaitlynn M. and Reneker, Jaymie L. and Kamel, Stephanie J.","2021","Ecosphere","Beach nourishment is a common coastal management practice used to protect and maintain infrastructure, tourist revenue, and sandy beach habitats. Coastal erosion and increased development along the coast of North Carolina, USA, have resulted in increased use of beach nourishment as an environmentally friendly alternative to hard structures, such as groins and jetties. Despite its advantages, beach nourishment can alter the thermal properties of a beach, potentially impacting the incubation environment of species that utilize this habitat during reproduction. Importantly, in organisms with temperature-dependent sex determination, the incubation environment plays a key role in determining offspring sex ratios, hatchling survival, and fitness. Here we investigate how beach nourishment influences thermal properties and sand characteristics of eight beaches in the high-density loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nesting region of North Carolina. We find that, despite considerable spatial and temporal variation, nourishment is a significant predictor of mean monthly sand temperatures in both univariate and multivariable predictive models. Across a season, nourished beach sections are, on average, 0.4 degrees C (range 0.3-0.8 degrees C) warmer than their unnourished counterparts. Nourishment is also a significant predictor of the mean and variance of sand grain size. Furthermore, variation in mean grain size, the relative percent of small, medium and large grain sizes and albedo are mainly responsible for differences in mean monthly sand temperatures. As such, the coarser and darker sand often used in nourishment projects may exacerbate climate driven increases in surface temperature.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2021.11012","selected",""

Corals exemplify both the need for AGF and its technical challenges; corals have declined in abundance, suffered pervasive reproductive failures, and struggled to adapt to climate change, yet mature corals cannot be easily moved for breeding, and coral gametes lose viability within hours. Here, we report the successful demonstration of AGF in corals using cryopreserved sperm that was frozen for 2 to 10 y. We fertilized Acropora palmata eggs from the western Caribbean (Curacao) with cryopreserved sperm from genetically distinct populations in the eastern and central Caribbean (Florida and Puerto Rico, respectively). We then confirmed interpopulation parentage in the Curacao-Florida offspring using 19,696 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. Thus, we provide evidence of reproductive compatibility of a Caribbean coral across a recognized barrier to gene flow. The 6-mo survival of AGF offspring was 42\%, the highest ever achieved in this species, yielding the largest wildlife population ever raised from cryopreserved material. By breeding a critically endangered coral across its range without moving adults, we show that AGF using cryopreservation is a viable conservation tool to increase genetic diversity in threatened marine populations.","Science \& Technology - Other Topics","2021.1720","selected",""

W. and Lin, Chiahsin and Peters, Esther C. and Hagedorn, Mary","2018","Scientific Reports","Climate change has increased the incidence of coral bleaching events, resulting in the loss of ecosystem function and biodiversity on reefs around the world. As reef degradation accelerates, the need for innovative restoration tools has become acute. Despite past successes with ultra-low temperature storage of coral sperm to conserve genetic diversity, cryopreservation of larvae has remained elusive due to their large volume, membrane complexity, and sensitivity to chilling injury. Here we show for the first time that coral larvae can survive cryopreservation and resume swimming after warming. Vitrification in a 3.5 M cryoprotectant solution (10\% v/v propylene glycol, 5\% v/v dimethyl sulfoxide, and 1 M trehalose in phosphate buffered saline) followed by warming at a rate of approximately 4,500,000 degrees C/min with an infrared laser resulted in up to 43\% survival of Fungia scutaria larvae on day 2 post-fertilization. Surviving larvae swam and continued to develop for at least 12 hours after laser-warming. This technology will enable biobanking of coral larvae to secure biodiversity, and, if managed in a high-throughput manner where millions of larvae in a species are frozen at one time, could become an invaluable research and conservation tool to help restore and diversify wild reef habitats.","Science \& Technology - Other Topics","2018.6541","selected",""
"Ecosystem-based management of seaweed harvesting","Lotze, Heike K. and Milewski, Inka and Fast, Julia and Kay, Lauren and Worm, Boris","2019","Botanica Marina","Harvesting wild seaweeds has a long history and is still relevant today, even though aquaculture now supplies >96\% of global seaweed production. Current wild harvests mostly target canopy-forming kelp, rockweed and red macroalgae that provide important ecosystem roles, including primary production, carbon storage, nutrient cycling, habitat provision, biodiversity and fisheries support. Harvest methods range from selective hand-cutting to bottom trawling. Resulting ecosystem impacts depend on extraction method and scale, ranging from changes in primary production to habitat disruption, fragmentation, food-web alterations and bycatch of non-target species. Current management often aims for sustainable harvesting in a single-species context, although some agencies acknowledge the wider ecosystem structure, functions and services seaweeds provide. We outline potential ecosystem-based management approaches that would help sustain productive and diverse seaweed-based ecosystems. These include maintaining high canopy biomass, recovery potential, habitat structure and connectivity, limiting bycatch and discards, while incorporating seasonal closures and harvest-exclusion zones into spatial management plans. Other sustainability considerations concern monitoring, enforcement and certification standards, a shift to aquaculture, and addressing cumulative human impacts, invasive species and climate change. Our review provides a concise overview on how to define and operationalize ecosystem-based management of seaweed harvesting that can inform ongoing management and conservation efforts.","Plant Sciences; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2019.2053","excluded",""
"Effects of established offshore wind farms on energy flow of coastal ecosystems: A case study of the Rudong offshore wind farms in China","Wang, Junjie and Zou, Xinqing and Yu, Wenwen and Zhang, Dongju and Wang, Teng","2019","Ocean \& Coastal Management","To assess the impact of offshore wind farms (OWFs) on the structure and energy flow of coastal ecosystems, Ecopath models of the Jiangsu coastal ecosystem (JCE) based on biological field data collected before and after the establishment of the Rudong OWFs in 2007 and 2015, respectively, were constructed and compared. The results indicated that after OWF construction, detritus, phytoplankton, zooplankton, anchovies, and some benthic fish were positively impacted. The increased primary production and detritus resulted in the increased food supply for zooplankton, which made it possible for planktivorous species (particularly anchovies) to be fed. Consequently, the biomass and production of some benthic fish increased, which indicates a potential reef effect. Other groups with decreased biomasses and productions may have been negatively impacted by the OWFs. Herbivory flows dominated the pre- and post-construction JCE despite their low transfer efficiencies; however, the proportion of detritivory flow increased after OWF construction, and this was especially prominent at high trophic levels. The post-construction JCE was immature with lower system connectivity, trophic flow utilisation, and transfer efficiency. However, the ecosystem tended to develop towards higher maturity with higher energy throughput, ecosystem activity, and recycling capability.","Oceanography; Water Resources","2019.15865","selected",""
"Livestock and Aquaculture Management for Climate-Smart Agriculture","Bhattacharyya, P. and Pathak, H. and Pal, S.","2020","Green Energy And Technology","The livestock and aquaculture sectors are to be managed efficiently to ensure food security under changing climatic scenarios. The changing climate would pose a challenge to the livestock sector due to adverse impact on fodder production, water scarcity, higher disease and pest attack, poor nutritional quality of fodder crops, and reduction in animal reproduction efficiency. In the future, these sectors would be further faced with challenges of land and water scarcity that would be aggravated under changing climatic conditions. In general, the increase in temperature will lead to reduction in feed intake, reproduction ability, sperm count, conception rate, and ultimately high mortality rate. The livestock breeding method should focus on the survival of livestock under harsh conditions, such as nutrition deficiency, heat tolerance, and resistance to pests, parasites, and diseases. Integrated management of water, soil, and plant resources will increase input use efficiency, and favor climate change adaptation and sustain productivity. The mixed system of livestock management offers multiple benefits and better adaptation to climate change by improving crop and livestock production and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Replacement of livestock species, integrated livestock farming systems are the need of the hour. Climate change-induced sea-level rise would bring new environmental conditions for coastal fisheries and aquaculture. The best adaptation method for these sectors under changing climate could be diversification in production systems. A diversified system is more tolerant to temperature and water stress, and also to pest and disease attacks. The adaptation options are broadly classified as diet based, genetic-management, relocation, use of information and communication technology, etc. Moreover, the vulnerability of these sectors is to be reduced and the resilience of communities involved in managing these sectors should be strengthened.

"Overcoming restoration paradigms: value of the historical record and metapopulation dynamics in native oyster restoration","Lipcius, Romuald N. and Burke, Russell P. and McCulloch, Danielle N. and Schreiber, Sebastian J. and Schulte, David M. and Seitz, Rochelle D. and Shen, Jian","2015","Frontiers In Marine Science","Restoration strategies for native oyster populations rely on multiple sources of information, which often conflict due to time- and space-varying patterns in abundance and distribution. For instance, strategies based on population connectivity and disease resistance can differ, and extant and historical records of abundance and distribution are often at odds, such that the optimal strategy is unclear and valuable restoration sites may be excluded from consideration. This was the case for the Lynnhaven River subestuary of lower Chesapeake Bay, which was deemed unsuitable for Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) restoration based on physical conditions, disease challenge, and extant oyster abundance. Consequently, we (i) evaluated previously unknown historical data from the 1800s, (ii) quantified extant oyster recruitment and abundance, physical conditions, and disease presence on constructed restoration reefs and alternative substrates, and (iii) assessed simulations from biophysical models to identify potential restoration sites in the metapopulation. The collective data distinguished numerous restoration sites (i) in the polyhaline zone (salinity 18.4-22.2) where disease resistance is evolving, (ii) where oysters were abundant in the late 1800s-early 1900s, (iii) of recent high recruitment, abundance and survival, despite consistent and elevated disease challenge, and (iv) interconnected as a metapopulation via larval dispersal. Moreover, a network of constructed restoration reefs met size structure, abundance and biomass standards of restoration success. These findings demonstrate that assumptions about the suitability of sites for oyster restoration based on individual processes can be severely flawed, and that in-depth examination of multiple processes and sources of information are required for oyster reef restoration plans to maximize success. We use these findings and previous information to recommend a strategy for successful restoration of subtidal oyster reefs throughout the range of the Eastern Oyster.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2015.9143",NA,""

These include increasing abundance of reef organisms both inside and outside NTAs, protecting key ecosystem functions, and providing social and economic benefits through improved fisheries and tourism. However, there is a lack of convincing evidence for many of these expectations. This is the first attempt to synthesize all potential costs and benefits of coral reef NTAs and critically examine evidence of their impacts on both ecosystems and societies. NTAs with high compliance consistently increase the diversity, density and biomass of exploited reef fishes and certain groups of motile invertebrates within their boundaries and have benefits for reef-associated tourism.

The effects of NTAs on genetic diversity and connectivity among meta-populations are variable or as yet unquantified. There is limited evidence of NTAs providing social benefits through increased fishery yields and tourism revenue. There are examples of both positive and negative effects on social well-being.

Local sea surface temperature (SST) increased significantly over this period, with concomitant changes in lower trophic levels. Simultaneously, the region has been subject to fishing pressure and shipping disturbance and is a priority area for renewable energy developments. We used colony-based and at-sea data to quantitatively assess relationships between SST and counts, productivity and survival of 25 species for which sufficient data were available for analysis. For the remaining species, we applied a qualitative approach using published population trends, published climate relationships and foraging sensitivity. In total, 53\% of species showed negative relationships with SST. Trends in counts and demography were combined with climate vulnerability to give an index of population concern to future climate warming, and 44\% of species were classified as high or very high concern, notably cormorants, grebes, skuas, shearwaters, terns and auks, as well as species breeding in the region. Qualitative assessments of vulnerability to fisheries, pollutants, disturbance (including introduced predators), marine renewables and climate found that 93\% of species were vulnerable to >= 2 threats, and 58\% to >= 4.

However, some technologies have considerable potential to impact on the biodiversity of the environments in which they are placed. In this study, an assessment was undertaken of the realistic deployment potential of a range of renewable energy technologies in the UK, considering constraints imposed by biodiversity conservation priorities. We focused on those energy sources that have the potential to make important energy contributions but which might conflict with biodiversity conservation objectives. These included field-scale solar, bioenergy crops, wind energy (both onshore and offshore), wave and tidal stream energy. The spatially-explicit analysis considered the potential opportunity available for each technology, at various levels of ecological risk. The resultant maps highlight the energy resource available, physical and policy constraints to deployment, and ecological sensitivity (based on the distribution of protected areas and sensitive species). If the technologies are restricted to areas which currently appear not to have significant ecological constraints, the total potential energy output from these energy sources was estimated to be in the region of 5,547 TWh/yr. This would be sufficient to meet projected energy demand in the UK, and help to achieve carbon reduction targets. However, we highlight two important caveats. First, further ecological monitoring and surveillance is required to improve understanding of wildlife distributions and therefore potential impacts of utilising these energy sources. This is likely to reduce the total energy available, especially at sea. Second, some of the technologies under investigation are currently not deployed commercially. Consequently this potential energy will only be available if continued effort is put into developing these energy sources/technologies, to enable realisation of their full potential.

"Aspects of Restoration for estuarine habitats following spills of oil and petroleum-derived substances","Hinson, M.O., Jr.","1972","Proceedings Of The Annual Offshore Technology Conference","With increasing use of offshore and estuarine facilities for production, handling, and transportation of refined and crude oil products, the potential for ecologically-destructive spillage is greatly enhanced. Restoration of damaged habitats previously has been limited to mechanical and chemical cleanup, with biological devastation left to natural recovery. However, the long time periods necessary to achieve successful ecological recovery must be shortened to allow for maximum utilization of local sport and commercial fisheries, wildlife and waterfowl resources, and water-oriented recreation. Estuarine habitats may be greatly impaired by large quantities of spilled oil due to the toxic aromatics and water-soluble fractions, emulsification of oil, and adsorption of oil into sediments. High initial mortality may completely eliminate sensitive benthic and intertidal faunas, or, if incomplete, drastically alter the existing species diversity and community stability. Repopulation will be hindered by lack of adequate food resources, residual sediment toxicity, lack of clean substrate for larval attachment, and the seasonal abundance of immigrating juvenile and larval forms. Actual restocking of recently captured or cultivated organisms may become necessary in areas of greatest impact, such as spawning and nursery grounds. Certain species, i.e. penaeid shrimp post-larvae, oysters, blue crabs, and various estuarine fish, may be obtainable through private companies and federal, state, or university fishery labs, particularly those involved in mariculture research. Direct additions of selected organisms may circumvent various successional stages in the recovery process, and restore estuarine ecosystem balance more quickly.

"Coral husbandry for ocean futures: leveraging abiotic factors to increase survivorship, growth, and resilience in juvenile Montipora capitata","Hancock, Joshua R. and Barrows, Andrew R. and Roome, Teagan C. and Huffmyer, Ariana S. and Matsuda, Shayle B. and Munk, Ninah J. and Rahnke, Sophia A. and Drury, Crawford","2021","Marine Ecology Progress Series","Reef restoration via direct outplanting of sexually propagated juvenile corals is a key strategy in preserving coral reef ecosystem function in the face of global and local stressors (e.g. ocean warming). To advance our capacity to scale and maximize the efficiency of restoration initiatives, we examined how abiotic conditions (i.e. larval rearing temperature, substrate condition, light intensity, and flow rate) interact to enhance post-settlement survival and growth of sexually propagated juvenile Montipora capitata. Larvae were reared at 3 temperatures (high: 28.9 degrees C, ambient: 27.2 degrees C, low: 24.5 degrees C) for 72 h during larval development, and were subsequently settled on aragonite plugs conditioned in seawater (1 or 10 wk) and raised in different light and flow regimes. These juvenile corals underwent a natural bleaching event in Kane'ohe Bay, O'ahu, Hawai'i (USA), in summer 2019, allowing us to opportunistically measure bleaching response in addition to survivorship and growth. This study demonstrates how leveraging light and flow can increase the survivorship and growth of juvenile M. capitata. In contrast, larval preconditioning and substrate conditioning had little overall effect on survivorship, growth, or bleaching response. Importantly, there was no optimal combination of abiotic conditions that maximized survival and growth in addition to bleaching tolerances. This study highlights the ability to tailor sexual reproduction for specific restoration goals by addressing knowledge gaps and incorporating practices that could improve resilience in propagated stocks.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","2021.554","selected",""
"Machine Learning for the Fast and Accurate Assessment of Fitness in Coral Early Life History","Macadam, Alex and Nowell, Cameron J. and Quigley, Kate","2021","Remote Sensing","As coral reefs continue to degrade globally due to climate change, considerable effort and investment is being put into coral restoration. The production of coral offspring via asexual and sexual reproduction are some of the proposed tools for restoring coral populations and will need to be delivered at scale. Simple, inexpensive, and high-throughput methods are therefore needed for rapid analysis of thousands of coral offspring. Here we develop a machine learning pipeline to rapidly and accurately measure three key indicators of coral juvenile fitness: survival, size, and color. Using machine learning, we classify pixels through an open-source, user-friendly interface to quickly identify and measure coral juveniles on two substrates (field deployed terracotta tiles and experimental, laboratory PVC plastic slides). The method's ease of use and ability to be trained quickly and accurately using small training sets make it suitable for application with images of species of sexually produced corals without existing datasets. Our results show higher accuracy of survival for slides (94.6\% accuracy with five training images) compared to field tiles measured over multiple months (March: 77.5\%, June: 91.3\%, October: 97.9\% accuracy with 100 training images). When using fewer training images, accuracy of area measurements was also higher on slides (7.7\% average size difference) compared to tiles (24.2\% average size difference for October images). The pipeline was 36x faster than manual measurements. The slide images required fewer training images compared to tiles and we provided cut-off guidelines for training for both substrates. These results highlight the importance and power of incorporating high-throughput methods, substrate choice, image quality, and number of training images for measurement accuracy. This study demonstrates the utility of machine learning tools for scalable ecological studies and conservation practices to facilitate rapid management decisions for reef protection.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science \& Photographic Technology","2021.6087","selected",""
