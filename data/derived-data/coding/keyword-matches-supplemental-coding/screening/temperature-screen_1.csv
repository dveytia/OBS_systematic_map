Modeling Coral Bleaching Mitigation Potential of Water Vertical Translocation - An Analogue to Geoengineered Artificial Upwelling,"Feng, Ellias Y. and Sawall, Yvonne and Wall, Marlene and Lebrato, Mario and Fu, Yao",2020,Frontiers In Marine Science,"Artificial upwelling (AU) is a novel geoengineering technology that brings seawater from the deep ocean to the surface. Within the context of global warming, AU techniques are proposed to reduce sea surface temperature at times of thermal stress around coral reefs. A computationally fast but coarse 3D Earth System model (3.6 degrees longitude x 1.8 degrees latitude) was used to investigate the environmental impacts of hypothetically implemented AU strategies in the Great Barrier Reef, South China Sea, and Hawaiian regions. While omitting the discussion on sub-grid hydrology, we simulated in our model a water translocation from either 130 or 550 m depth to sea surface at rates of 1 or 50 m(3) s(-1) as analogs to AU implementation. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 emissions scenario from year 2020 on, the model predicted a prevention of coral bleaching until the year 2099 when AU was implemented, except under the least intense AU scenario (water from 130 m depth at 1 m(3) s(-1)). Yet, intense AU implementation (water from 550 m depth at 50 m(3) s(-1)) will likely have adverse effects on coral reefs by overcooling the surface water, altering salinity, decreasing calcium carbonate saturation, and considerably increasing nutrient levels. Our result suggests that if we utilize AU for mitigating coral bleaching during heat stress, AU implementation needs to be carefully designed with respect to AU's location, depth, intensity and duration so that undesirable environmental effects are minimized. Following a proper installation and management procedure, however, AU has the potential to decelerate destructive bleaching events and buy corals more time to adjust to climate change.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology,2020.3983,selected,
An Ecosystem-Level Perspective on the Host and Symbiont Traits Needed to Mitigate Climate Change Impacts on Caribbean Coral Reefs,"Ortiz, Juan Carlos and Gonzalez-Rivero, Manuel and Mumby, Peter J.",2014,Ecosystems,"Caribbean reefs have steadily declined during the past 30 years. Thermal disturbances that elicit coral bleaching have been identified as a major driver of such coral degradation. It has been suggested that either the evolution of more tolerant symbionts, or shifts in the distribution of existing, tolerant symbionts could ameliorate the effect of rising sea temperatures on Caribbean reefs. Using a spatial ecosystem model we describe the characteristics that new tolerant symbionts, `super-symbionts', and their coral hosts, require for coral cover to be maintained. We also quantify the time necessary for such symbionts to become dominant before their potential beneficial effect is lost. Running scenarios under two levels of greenhouse gas emissions, we find that aggressive action to reduce emissions could almost triple the time available for new super-symbionts to become dominant and potentially mitigate the effect of thermal disturbances. The benefits of thermally tolerant super-symbionts depend on the life-history traits of the host, the number of coral species infected and the present coral assemblage. Corals that are strong competitors with macroalgae are likely to become dominant on future reefs if a super-symbiont appears in the next 25-60 years. In principle, super-symbionts could have ecosystem-level benefits in the Caribbean providing that they become dominant in multiple coral hosts with specific life-history traits within the next 60 years. This potential benefit would only be realized if the appearance of the super-symbiont is combined with drastic reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and maintenance of ecosystem processes such as herbivory.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology,2014.8024,selected,
Prioritizing reef resilience through spatial planning following a mass coral bleaching event,"Chung, Anne E. and Wedding, Lisa M. and Meadows, Amber and Moritsch, Monica M. and Donovan, Mary K. and Gove, Jamison and Hunter, Cynthia",2019,Coral Reefs,"Following the recent 2014-2017 global coral bleaching event, managers are seeking interventions to promote long-term resilience beyond monitoring coral decline. Here, we applied a spatial approach to investigate one potential intervention, mapping areas where local management could build coral reef resilience using herbivore management. Although herbivore management is a top recommendation in resilience-based management, site-specific attributes are thought to affect its success, and thus strategizing placement and design of these areas are crucial. Using Marxan, we mapped and prioritized potential Herbivore Management Areas (HMAs), where herbivores are protected but other types of fishing are allowed, in the main Hawaiian Islands. Through four scenarios, we found multiple hotspots along the west coast of Hawai'i Island and around the islands of Moloka'i, Lana'i, Maui, and Kaho'olawe where HMAs may have the best chance for success based on habitat, ecologically critical areas, life history, and social considerations. We further analyzed top results and found that a subset of characteristics including habitat types, biomass of herbivore functional groups, and temperature variability were significantly different from surrounding areas and thus contain potential drivers for selection. This unique approach can serve as an example for coral reef management in Hawai'i, on other Pacific Islands, and beyond, as it provides practical guidance on how to apply a resilience-building tool at a local level, incorporating site-specific biological and socioeconomic considerations.",Marine \& Freshwater Biology,2019.614,selected,
Diverse coral communities in mangrove habitats suggest a novel refuge from climate change,"Yates, K. K. and Rogers, C. S. and Herlan, J. J. and Brooks, G. R. and Smiley, N. A. and Larson, R. A.",2014,Biogeosciences,"Risk analyses indicate that more than 90\% of the world's reefs will be threatened by climate change and local anthropogenic impacts by the year 2030 under ``business-asusual{''} climate scenarios. Increasing temperatures and solar radiation cause coral bleaching that has resulted in extensive coral mortality. Increasing carbon dioxide reduces seawater pH, slows coral growth, and may cause loss of reef structure. Management strategies include establishment of marine protected areas with environmental conditions that promote reef resiliency. However, few resilient reefs have been identified, and resiliency factors are poorly defined. Here we characterize the first natural, non-reef coral refuge from thermal stress and ocean acidification and identify resiliency factors for mangrove-coral habitats. We measured diurnal and seasonal variations in temperature, salinity, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and seawater chemistry; characterized substrate parameters; and examined water circulation patterns in mangrove communities where scleractinian corals are growing attached to and under mangrove prop roots in Hurricane Hole, St. John, US Virgin Islands. Additionally, we inventoried the coral species and quantified incidences of coral bleaching, mortality, and recovery for two major reef-building corals, Colpophyllia natans and Diploria labyrinthiformis, growing in mangrove-shaded and exposed (unshaded) areas. Over 30 species of scleractinian corals were growing in association with mangroves. Corals were thriving in low-light (more than 70\% attenuation of incident PAR) from mangrove shading and at higher temperatures than nearby reef tract corals. A higher percentage of C. natans colonies were living shaded by mangroves, and no shaded colonies were bleached. Fewer D. labyrinthiformis colonies were shaded by mangroves, however more unshaded colonies were bleached. A combination of substrate and habitat heterogeneity, proximity of different habitat types, hydrographic conditions, and biological influences on seawater chemistry generate chemical conditions that buffer against ocean acidification. This previously undocumented refuge for corals provides evidence for adaptation of coastal organisms and ecosystem transition due to recent climate change. Identifying and protecting other natural, non-reef coral refuges is critical for sustaining corals and other reef species into the future.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Geology,2014.7767,selected,
"Larval thermal conditioning does not improve post-settlement thermal tolerance in the dominant reef-building coral, Montipora capitata","Alexander, Gyasi and Hancock, Joshua R. and Huffmyer, Ariana S. and Matsuda, Shayle B.",2022,Coral Reefs,"Climate change-induced ocean warming has reshaped reef ecosystems as coral bleaching events continue to lead to mass coral die-offs globally. These thermal anomalies also negatively affect reef persistence and recovery when heat stress events continue to occur during critical reproduction and recruitment periods. As a result, recruitment (settlement and survival of early life stages) continues to decline on reefs globally, compromising the recovery of reef systems following mass bleaching and mortality events, which has led to the loss of ecological function on these reefs. One mitigation strategy within the active restoration framework includes propagated corals (i.e., adult fragments, larvae, or juveniles) produced in nurseries that are then directly out planted to the reef benthos. Restoration programs can greatly benefit from use of sexually derived coral propagules, which when optimized, increase the scalability and genetic diversity of outplanted stock. Thermal conditioning during larval rearing has the potential to be a cost-effective and scalable strategy to enhance the survival and stress tolerance of subsequent life stages. Here, we tested the potential for thermal conditioning during the larval stage to induce positive latent effects on the stress tolerance of Montipora capitata spat. We exposed larvae to cool (24.5 degrees C), ambient (27.2 degrees C), and warm (28.9 degrees C) conditions for four days and during this period we tracked larval survival. Following thermal conditioning during the larval stage, we measured settlement success and then exposed spat to a 47-day high temperature stress (+ 2 degrees C) and measured survival. We found that larval thermal conditioning did not provide survival benefits to spat under elevated temperature. Furthermore, larval exposure to temperatures outside of an ambient regime compromised survival, suggesting that although positive latent effects were not observed here in spat, optimizing thermal conditions is important for maximizing survival and settlement of coral larvae.",Marine \& Freshwater Biology,2022.1652,selected,
Sustainability & Comparative Impact Analysis of Coral reef bleaching in Indian context,"Goswami, M. and Ali, H.",2022,Ecs Transactions,"An estimated value of 500 million of the population are directly benefited through coral reefs related jobs, food and defence of coastal areas. Coral reefs help to reduce wave energy by 97%. They help to protect the coastal areas from storms, floods and wave energy by 97%. Natural disasters such as Tsunami and erosion of coastal areas are protected by reefs. In this process, they help to protect the lives of many staying in the coastal areas including animals, properties, and other natural resources. There are reasons for reef deterioration like change of climate, high pollution, destructive fishing, bleaching of coral reefs is a big concern now worldwide. Severe coral bleaching is also reported in India. A significant rise in the surface temperature of Sea has become a critical reason for coral bleaching.

Optimising cool-water injections to reduce thermal stress on coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef,"Baird, M.E. and Green, R. and Lowe, R. and Mongin, M. and Bougeot, E.",2020,Plos One,"Coral bleaching driven by ocean warming is one of the most visible ecological impacts of climate change and perhaps the greatest threat to the persistence of reefs in the coming decades. In the absence of returning atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations to those compatible with ocean temperatures below the mass coral bleaching temperature thresholds, the most straightforward means to reduce thermal-stress induced bleaching is to cool water at the seabed. The feasibility of reducing the seabed temperature through cool-water injections is considered first by analysing the feasibility of doing so on 19 reefs with differing physical environments using a simple residence time metric in 200 m resolution hydrodynamic model configurations. We then concentrate on the reefs around Lizard Island, the most promising candidate of the 19 locations, and develop a 40 m hydrodynamic model to investigate the effect of the injection of cool water at differing volumetric rates. Injecting 27Â°C seawater at a rate of 5 m3 s-1 at 4 sites in early 2017 cooled 97 ha of the reef by 0.15Â°C or more. The power required to pump 5 m3 s-1 through a set of pipes over a distance of 3 km from a nearby channel is 466 kW. This power applied at 4 sites for 3 months achieves a 2 Degree Heating Weeks (DHWs) reduction on 97 ha of reef. A more precise energy costing will require further expert engineering design of the pumping equipment and energy sources. Even for the most physically favourable reefs, cool-water transported through pipes and injected at a reef site is energy expensive and cannot be scaled up to any meaningful fraction of the 3,100 reefs of the GBR. Should priority be given to reducing thermal stress on one or a few high value reefs, this paper provides a framework to identify the most promising sites. Copyright: Â© 2020 Baird et al.

Coral reefs of the Red Sea - Challenges and potential solutions,"Fine, M. and Cinar, M. and Voolstra, C. R. and Safa, A. and Rinkevich, B. and Laffoley, D. and Hilmi, N. and Allemand, D.",2019,Regional Studies In Marine Science,"The Red Sea is a unique body of water, hosting some of the most productive and diverse coral reefs. Human populations along coasts of the Red Sea were initially sparse due to the hot and arid climate surrounding it, but this is changing with improved desalination techniques, accessible energy, and increased economic interest in coastal areas. In addition to increasing pressure on reefs from coastal development, global drivers, primarily ocean acidification and seawater warming, are threatening coral reefs of the region. While reefs in southern sections of the Red Sea live near or above their maximum temperature tolerance and have experienced bleaching events in the recent past, coral reefs in northern sections are considered a coral reef refugia from global warming and acidification, at least for the coming decades. Such differential sensitivities along the latitudinal gradient of the Red Sea require differential solutions and management. In an effort to identify the appropriate solutions to conserve and maintain resilience of these reefs along a latitudinal gradient, we used a SWOT analysis ( strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats) to frame the present situation and to propose policy solutions as useful planning procedures. We highlight the need for immediate action to secure the northern sections of the Red Sea as a coral reef climate change refuge by management and removal of local stressors. There is a need to strengthen the scientific knowledge base for proper management and to encourage regional collaboration on environmental issues. Based on scientific data, solutions such as marine protected areas, fishing regulation, and reef restoration approaches were ranked for five distinct latitudinal sections in the Red Sea and levels of interventions are recommended.

A role for bacterial experimental evolution in coral bleaching mitigation?,"Maire, Justin and van Oppen, Madeleine J. H.",2022,Trends In Microbiology,"Coral reefs are rapidly declining because of widespread mass coral bleaching causing extensive coral mortality. Elevated seawater temperatures are the main drivers of coral bleaching, and climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of destructive marine heatwaves. Efforts to enhance coral thermal bleaching tolerance can be targeted at the coral host or at coral-associated microorganisms (e.g., dinoflagellate endosymbionts and bacteria). The literature on experimental evolution of bacteria suggests that it has value as a tool to increase coral climate resilience. We provide a workflow on how to experimentally evolve coral-associated bacteria to confer thermal tolerance to coral hosts and emphasize the value of implementing this approach in coral reef conservation and restoration efforts.",Biochemistry \& Molecular Biology; Microbiology,2022.6276,selected,
Marine protected areas do not buffer corals from bleaching under global warming,"Johnson, V, Jack and Dick, Jaimie T. A. and Pincheira-Donoso, Daniel",2022,Bmc Ecology And Evolution,"Background The rising temperature of the oceans has been identified as the primary driver of mass coral reef declines via coral bleaching (expulsion of photosynthetic endosymbionts). Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been implemented throughout the oceans with the aim of mitigating the impact of local stressors, enhancing fish biomass, and sustaining biodiversity overall. In coral reef regions specifically, protection from local stressors and the enhanced ecosystem function contributed by MPAs are expected to increase coral resistance to global-scale stressors such as marine heatwaves. However, MPAs still suffer from limitations in design, or fail to be adequately enforced, potentially reducing their intended efficacy. Here, we address the hypothesis that the local-scale benefits resulting from MPAs moderate coral bleaching under global warming related stress. Results Bayesian analyses reveal that bleaching is expected to occur in both larger and older MPAs when corals are under thermal stress from marine heatwaves (quantified as Degree Heating Weeks, DHW), but this is partially moderated in comparison to the effects of DHW alone. Further analyses failed to identify differences in bleaching prevalence in MPAs relative to non-MPAs for coral reefs experiencing different levels of thermal stress. Finally, no difference in temperatures where bleaching occurs between MPA and non-MPA sites was found. Conclusions Our findings suggest that bleaching is likely to occur under global warming regardless of protected status. Thus, while protected areas have key roles for maintaining ecosystem function and local livelihoods, combatting the source of global warming remains the best way to prevent the decline of coral reefs via coral bleaching.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics \& Heredity,2022.8582,selected,
Sunscreen bans: Coral reefs and skin cancer,"Raffa, Robert B. and Pergolizzi, Jr., Joseph V. and Taylor, Jr., Robert and Kitzen, Jan M. and NEMA Res Grp",2019,Journal Of Clinical Pharmacy And Therapeutics,"What is known and objective Hawaii will ban two major ingredients of sunscreens. This article reviews the reasons and future directions. Hawaii recently enacted legislation that will ban the use of two major ingredients of the majority of commonly used sunscreens. The reason for the ban is the ingredients' putative deleterious impact on marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs. But sunscreens also save lives by decreasing the risk of UV-induced skin cancers. We review both sides of the issue and potential implications for the healthcare system. Comment Coral reefs consist of organisms in delicate equilibria that are susceptible to small changes in their surroundings. Recent natural and man-made disruptions, direct or indirect, such as changes in ocean temperature and chemistry, ingress of invasive species, pathogens, pollution and deleterious fishing practices, have been blamed for the poor health, or even the outright destruction, of some coral reefs. The most popular sunscreen products contain two ingredients-oxybenzone and octinoxate-that have also been implicated in coral toxicity and will be banned. This creates a healthcare dilemma: Will the protection of coral reefs result in an increase in human skin cancers? What is new and conclusion Concentration estimates and mechanism studies support an association-direct or indirect (via promotion of viral infection)-of sunscreens with bleaching of coral reefs. A ban on the two most common sunscreen ingredients goes into effect in Hawaii on January 1, 2021. Proponents suggest that this is a trend, just the first of many such bans worldwide; opponents warn of a dire increase in human skin cancers.

Building a reef of sustainability,"Abraham, M.",2006,Environmental Progress,"The effect of energy production and rise in atmospheric CO 2 on the sustainability of endangered coral reefs at the Bermuda region, is discussed. The increase in CO 2 levels in the atmosphere produces global warming which has led to increasing ocean temperatures. Atmospheric CO 2 dissolves into seawater in equilibrium with the atmospheric concentration, turning the oceans more acidic. If there is sufficient genetic diversity within the coral reef, the reefs can adapt to changes in the ecosystem, but upto a certain level. Acidity in the seawater leads to the bleaching of these coral reefs, which is a rising concern. These coral reefs are storehouse of biodiversity and contain many species which are yet to be identified. Coral reef sustainability needs a careful management strategy integrating the socio-economic and environmental factors. It is suggested that the society should first realize the importance of the coral reefs and take steps to preserve them.",NA,2006.5819,excluded,
Increasing comparability among coral bleaching experiments,"Grottoli, A. G. and Toonen, R. J. and van Woesik, R. and Thurber, R. Vega and Warner, M. E. and McLachlan, R. H. and Price, J.

C.",2021,Ecological Applications,"Coral bleaching is the single largest global threat to coral reefs worldwide. Integrating the diverse body of work on coral bleaching is critical to understanding and combating this global problem. Yet investigating the drivers, patterns, and processes of coral bleaching poses a major challenge. A recent review of published experiments revealed a wide range of experimental variables used across studies. Such a wide range of approaches enhances discovery, but without full transparency in the experimental and analytical methods used, can also make comparisons among studies challenging. To increase comparability but not stifle innovation, we propose a common framework for coral bleaching experiments that includes consideration of coral provenance, experimental conditions, and husbandry. For example, reporting the number of genets used, collection site conditions, the experimental temperature offset(s) from the maximum monthly mean (MMM) of the collection site, experimental light conditions, flow, and the feeding regime will greatly facilitate comparability across studies. Similarly, quantifying common response variables of endosymbiont (Symbiodiniaceae) and holobiont phenotypes (i.e., color, chlorophyll, endosymbiont cell density, mortality, and skeletal growth) could further facilitate cross-study comparisons. While no single bleaching experiment can provide the data necessary to determine global coral responses of all corals to current and future ocean warming, linking studies through a common framework as outlined here, would help increase comparability among experiments, facilitate synthetic insights into the causes and underlying mechanisms of coral bleaching, and reveal unique bleaching responses among genets, species, and regions. Such a collaborative framework that fosters transparency in methods used would strengthen comparisons among studies that can help inform coral reef management and facilitate conservation strategies to mitigate coral bleaching worldwide.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology,2021.1474,excluded,

These global stressors: cannot be avoided by local management, compound local stressors, and hasten the loss of ecosystem services. Impacts to people will be most grave where a) human dependence on coral reef ecosystems is high, b) sea surface temperature reaches critical levels soonest, and c) ocean acidification levels are most severe. Where these elements align, swift action will be needed to protect people's lives and livelihoods, but such action must be informed by data and science. An Indicator Approach Designing policies to offset potential harm to coral reef ecosystems and people requires a better understanding of where CO2-related global environmental stresses could cause the most severe impacts. Mapping indicators has been proposed as a way of combining natural and social science data to identify policy actions even when the needed science is relatively nascent. To identify where people are at risk and where more science is needed, we map indicators of biological, physical and social science factors to understand how human dependence on coral reef ecosystems will be affected by globally-driven threats to corals expected in a high-CO2 world. Western Mexico, Micronesia, Indonesia and parts of Australia have high human dependence and will likely face severe combined threats. As a region, Southeast Asia is particularly at risk. Many of the countries most dependent upon coral reef ecosystems are places for which we have the least robust data on ocean acidification.

Conservation management approaches to protecting the capacity for corals to respond to climate change: a theoretical comparison,"Baskett, Marissa L. and Nisbet, Roger M. and Kappel, Carrie V. and Mumby, Peter J. and Gaines, Steven D.",2010,Global Change Biology,"Multiple anthropogenic impacts, including bleaching from climate change-related thermal stress, threaten coral reefs. Protecting coral capacity to respond to the increase in future thermal stress expected with climate change can involve (1) protecting coral reefs with characteristics indicative of greater resistance and resilience to climate change, and (2) reducing other anthropogenic impacts that are more likely to reduce coral resistance and resilience to climate change. Here, we quantitatively compare possible priorities and existing recommendations for protecting coral response capacity to climate change. Specifically, we explore the relative importance of the relevant dynamics, processes, and parameters in a size-structured model of coral and zooxanthellae ecological and evolutionary dynamics given projected future thermal stress. Model results with varying initial conditions indicate that protecting diverse coral communities is critical, and protecting communities with higher abundances of more thermally tolerant coral species and symbiont types secondary, to the long-term maintenance of coral cover. A sensitivity analysis of the coral population size in each size class and the total coral cover with respect to all parameter values suggests greater relative importance of reducing additional anthropogenic impacts that affect coral-macroalgal competition, early coral life history stages, and coral survivorship (compared with reproduction, growth, and shrinkage). Finally, model results with temperature trajectories from different locations, with and without connectivity, indicate that protection of, and connectivity to, low-thermal-stress locations may enhance the capacity for corals to respond to climate change.",Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology,2010.4663,selected,

However, climate variability and its impacts are affecting fishers, their communities, and fishing grounds. This study aimed to determine the perceived impacts of climate change and vulnerability of small-scale fisheries in selected fishing communities around the Davao Gulf. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to gather data on the perceptions of fishers (N = 220) on the impacts of climate change on their livelihood and communities. Seven focus groups corroborated the collected data and conclusions reached (N = 15). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the sources of vulnerability and number of impacts of climate change. Regression was used to determine factors influencing the catch per unit effort (CPUE). The PCA results showed that for the vulnerability, the sources, coral bleaching, inadequate food, lack of credit access, changes in weather pattern and hotter temperature contributed highly. For the climate change impacts, the factors, less seasonality, unclear reproductive patterns, diseases in the catch, invasive species, decrease in catch and venturing farther to fish offshore were substantially influential. Further analysis showed that disease and invasive species, decrease in fish catch, fishing farther offshore, and monthly income affected the CPUE of the fisheries. Recommendations for climate change vulnerability reduction based on the conclusions reached in this study include more financial credit access, apprehension of illegal fishers, increased capacity building and technical skills for coastal communities, supplemental livelihoods, and information dissemination on climate change adaptation strategies.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology,2021.1079,excluded,

The Maldives,"Price, A.R.G. and Clark, S.",2000,Seas At The Millennium - An Environmental Evaluation - Volume 2,"The Maldives are a low-lying atoll nation comprising around 1120 islands within 26 geographic atolls. The country's continued physical and economic existence is dependent on the underlying coral reef platform. This provides a dynamic and unstable environment. Coral species richness is high, with 187 known species and, based on cluster analysis, the coral fauna of the Maldives shows greatest affinities with Chagos and Seychelles to the west. Both seagrasses and mangroves are uncommon, although mangrove diversity is remarkably high (10 species). Species of conservational significance include seabirds, which are used by Maldivian fishermen as a means of spotting tuna: 17 species are known to nest here. Endemic species include the fruit bat (Pteropys giganteus ariel); and there are several 'threatened' species listed in IUCN's Red Data Books, including five turtle species. Since the 1970s the population has risen dramatically, particularly in the capital Male. The population of Maldives was around 250,000 in 1995, with about 25% in Male. Total population is projected to rise to c. 321,957 by 2005. Coastal uses and consequential environmental pressures include instances of heavy exploitation or degradation of coastal fisheries and are of much concern. Other practical problems include unsustainable coral (and sand) mining. This has severely impaired the capacity of some reefs to act as natural sea defences, and undermined their biological role as areas for bait, other fish and as repositories of biodiversity. Problems of solid and liquid waste disposal can be acute, both in urban areas and on the tourist islands, eighty-seven of which are currently developed. Many aquifers are contaminated by faecal coliform bacteria, rendering the water unfit for direct consumption. Specific tourism-related concerns include impacts from infrastructures (i.e. resorts, jetties, vegetation clearance, turtle disturbance), and from diving and snorkelling. Other environmental concerns include occasional outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish, coral bleaching and global climate change. Threats posed by climatic changes and impending sea-level rise are taken very seriously, particularly since approximately 80% of Maldivian land area is less than 1 m above mean sea level. A reasonable body of national and international environmental legislation exists, but implementation remains problematic. Environmental habitat restoration has included attempts to restore reefs degraded from coral mining but coral transplantation has not been cost-effective. Given the large number of unoccupied Maldivian islands (nearly 1000), prospects for tourism and other forms of development seem quite favourable, though more attention should be focused on carrying capacity. A critical challenge for the Maldives will be economic development that does not limit important future coastal uses, which could happen unexpectedly following incremental use and unrecognised environmental deterioration. If incidences of coral bleaching (as witnessed in 1998) are linked to global trends in temperature increase, then more serious problems are likely to arise. These are outside the scope of national reef resource managers and planners. However, healthy reefs are likely to better withstand adverse effects of global events than reefs degraded by the effects of local human activities. This may well become an increasingly important factor influencing the sustainability of reef uses on low-lying islands such as the Maldives.",NA,2000.4539,excluded,"Exclude because while mention of international legislation is included, it is vague as to what the action/threat actually is"
Coral bleaching under unconventional scenarios of climate warming and ocean acidification,"Kwiatkowski, Lester and Cox, Peter and Halloran, Paul R. and Mumby, Peter J. and Wiltshire, Andy J.",2015,Nature Climate Change,"Elevated sea surface temperatures have been shown to cause mass coral bleaching(1-3). Widespread bleaching, affecting >90\% of global coral reefs and causing coral degradation, has been projected to occur by 2050 under all climate forcing pathways adopted by the IPCC for use within the Fifth Assessment Report4,5. These pathways include an extremely ambitious pathway aimed to limit global mean temperature rise to 2 degrees C (ref. 6; Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6-RCP2.6), which assumes full participation in emissions reductions by all countries, and even the possibility of negative emissions(7). The conclusions drawn from this body of work, which applied widely used algorithms to estimate coral bleaching(8), are that we must either accept that the loss of a large percentage of the world's coral reefs is inevitable, or consider technological solutions to buy those reefs time until atmospheric CO2 concentrations can be reduced. Here we analyse the potential for geoengineering, through stratospheric aerosol-based solar radiation management (SRM), to reduce the extent of global coral bleaching relative to ambitious climate mitigation. Exploring the common criticism of geoengineering-that ocean acidification and its impacts will continue unabated-we focus on the sensitivity of results to the aragonite saturation state dependence of bleaching. We do not, however, address the additional detrimental impacts of ocean acidification on processes such as coral calcification(9,10) that will further determine the benefit to corals of any SRM-based scenario. Despite the sensitivity of thermal bleaching thresholds to ocean acidification being uncertain(11,12), stabilizing radiative forcing at 2020 levels through SRM reduces the risk of global bleaching relative to RCP2.6 under all acidification-bleaching relationships analysed.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Meteorology \& Atmospheric Sciences,2015.6048,excluded,
