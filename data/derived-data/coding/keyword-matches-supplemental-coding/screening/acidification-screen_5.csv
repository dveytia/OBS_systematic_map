"Potential for Very Deep Ocean Storage of CO2 Without Ocean Acidification: A Discussion Paper","Goldthorpe, Steve","2017","NANA","Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an essential contributor to the mitigation of climate change. CCS will require vast CO2 storage capacity. At present only geological storage is being considered. This paper revisits an alternative CO2 storage possibility in enclosed basins on the deep and very deep ocean floor. For example, the Indonesian Sunda trench, the Japanese Ryukyu trench and the Puerto Rico trench are more than 6 km deep. If liquid CO2 were to be placed in such a trench, it would be 7\% more dense than seawater and could remain permanently as a lake of liquid CO2 on the ocean floor, possibly becoming a solid hydrate over time which could inhibit mixing between the stored CO2 and ocean currents. At depths greater than about 4 to 5 km metres, seawater is under-saturated in calcium carbonate, so ocean ecosystems are significantly different. Any impact on deep marine fauna would need to be investigated. The London Dumping Convention has provisions for disposal of material into the ocean provided the absence of adverse effects can be proven. Deep ocean CO2 entrapment is more certain than geological CO2 storage in deep aquifers. A CO2 delivery concept by ship and vertical pipe is suggested for exploratory trials, with subsea pipelines for permanent installations, which might be much cheaper than geological CO2 storage. There is vast capacity for storage of CO2 in the world's very deep ocean trenches. The Sunda trench below 6 km has the capacity to accommodate 19,000 gigatonnes of liquid CO2, which is greater than the CO2 yield from all currently known global fossil fuel reserves. The Puerto Rico trench has capacity for 24,000 Gt of liquid CO2 deeper than 7 km. Enclosed basins of limited area could easily accommodate captured CO2. China has the largest potential demand for CO2 storage from power generation and industrial sources, which could be 3 Gt per year by 2050. The Ryukyu trench, which is 700 km from the Chinese coast and is in Japanese water, has two sections deeper than 7 km. Those sections of the Ryukyu trench would have the capacity to accommodate all the CO2 captured in China at 3 Gt per year for over 200 years. In the event that very deep ocean storage of CO2 is found to be practicable and acceptable, the minimum practical depth would need to be determined as a criterions for acceptable additional storage locations. For consideration, there is an enclosed basin on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea 60 km off Southern Greece, with capacity for 84 Gt of CO2 deeper than 4.5 km. Also, there is an enclosed basin in the Arabian Sea, 320 km south west of Karachi, with capacity for 86 Gt of CO2 deeper than 3.5 km. The potential storage of CO2 in such locations would be temperature dependent. The global CCS community has previously considered ocean storage of CO2 on the basis of ultimate dissolution and dispersion of CO2 in ocean water. Those studies have dismissed ocean storage as environmentally unacceptable due to ocean acidification. This paper postulates that very deep ocean trenches (>6 km) and deep ocean floor depressions (>4 km) are environments for CO2 storage, where permanent storage without dissolution, acidification or adverse effects on fauna may be possible. The purpose of this paper is to pose the question ``Why not?{''} to the CCS community and to suggest that active research is timely. (C) 2017 The Authors.

"Seaweed farming for food and nutritional security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and women empowerment: A review","Sultana, F. and Wahab, M.A. and Nahiduzzaman, M. and Mohiuddin, M. and Iqbal, M.Z. and Shakil, A. and Mamun, A.-A. and Khan, M.S.R. and Wong, L. and Asaduzzaman, M.","2022","Aquaculture And Fisheries","Seaweed is a promising marine macroalgae of the millennium, providing various ecological, social, and economic benefits. At present, seaweed production reached 35.8 million t from farming, accounting for 97% of global seaweed output, with a world market of US$ 11.8 billion. Seaweeds are an excellent source of nutritious human food because of their low lipid content, high minerals, fibers, polyunsaturated fatty acids, polysaccharides, vitamins, and bioactive compounds. Many seaweed sub-products offer unique properties to develop various functional foods for the food processing industries. In the perspective of climate change mitigation, seaweed farms absorb carbon, serve as a CO2 sink and reduce agricultural emissions by providing raw materials for biofuel production and livestock feed. Seaweed farming system also helps in climate change adaptation by absorbing wave energy, safeguarding shorelines, raising the pH of the surrounding water, and oxygenating the waters to minimize the impacts of ocean acidification and hypoxia on a localized scale. Moreover, it contributes substantially to the sustainable development of the economic condition of coastal women by providing livelihood opportunities and ensuring financial solvency. This review paper highlights the significance of seaweed farming in global food and nutritional security, mitigation and adaptation to global climate change, and women empowerment within a single frame. This review paper also outlined the major issues and challenges of seaweed farming for obtaining maximum benefits in these aspects. The main challenges of making seaweed as a staple diet to millions of people include producing suitable species of seaweeds, making seaweed products accessible, affordable, nutritionally balanced, and attractive to the consumers. Various food products must be developed from seaweeds that may be considered equivalent to the foods consumed by humans today. Lack of effective marine spatial planning to avoid user conflicts is vital for expanding the seaweed farming systems to provide aquatic foods and contribute globally for mitigation and adaptation of climate change impacts. Hence, women's empowerment through seaweed farming is primarily constrained by the lack of technical knowledge and financial resources to establish the coastal farming system. All the information discussed in this paper will help to understand the critical needs for large-scale seaweed farming for climate resilience mariculture, potentials for global food security, and future research on various aspects of seaweed farming and their diverse utilization.

Climate change and ocean acidification are likely to have severe implications for many deep-sea ecosystems and communities, but what, if anything, can be done to mitigate these threats is poorly understood. To begin to bridge this gap, we convened a stakeholder workshop to assess and prioritize options for conserving legislatively protected deep-sea coral reefs off southeast Australia that, without management intervention, are likely to be severely degraded within decades as a result of climate change. Seventeen possible options were explored that span biological, engineering and regulatory domains and that differed widely in their perceived costs, benefits, time to implementation, and risks. In the short term, the highest priority identified is the need to urgently locate and protect sites globally that are, or will become, refugia areas for the coral and its associated community as climate change progresses.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Meteorology \& Atmospheric Sciences","2015.6279","selected",""

Specifically, we explore how ocean acidification affects the quantity and quality of resources key to human health and well-being in the context of: (1) malnutrition and poisoning, (2) respiratory issues, (3) mental health impacts, and (4) development of medical resources. We explore mitigation and adaptation management strategies that can be implemented to strengthen the capacity of acidifying oceans to continue providing human health benefits. Importantly, we emphasize that the cost of such actions will be dependent upon the socioeconomic context; specifically, costs will likely be greater for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, exacerbating the current inequitable distribution of environmental and human health challenges. Given the scale of ocean acidification impacts on human health and well-being, recognizing and researching these complexities may allow the adaptation of management such that not only are the harms to human health reduced but the benefits enhanced.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Public, Environmental \& Occupational Health","2020.674",NA,""
"Can ocean iron fertilization mitigate ocean acidification?","Cao, L. and Caldeira, K.","2010","Climatic Change","Ocean iron fertilization has been proposed as a method to mitigate anthropogenic climate change, and there is continued commercial interest in using iron fertilization to generate carbon credits. It has been further speculated that ocean iron fertilization could help mitigate ocean acidification. Here, using a global ocean carbon cycle model, we performed idealized ocean iron fertilization simulations to place an upper bound on the effect of iron fertilization on atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidification. Under the IPCC A2 CO2 emission scenario, at year 2100 the model simulates an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 965 ppm with the mean surface ocean pH 0. 44 units less than its pre-industrial value of 8. 18. A globally sustained ocean iron fertilization could not diminish CO2 concentrations below 833 ppm or reduce the mean surface ocean pH change to less than 0. 38 units. This maximum of 0. 06 unit mitigation in surface pH change by the end of this century is achieved at the cost of storing more anthropogenic CO2 in the ocean interior, furthering acidifying the deep-ocean. If the amount of net carbon storage in the deep ocean by iron fertilization produces an equivalent amount of emission credits, ocean iron fertilization further acidifies the deep ocean without conferring any chemical benefit to the surface ocean.

"Getting rid of atmospheric carbon: Sequestration and air capture",NA,"2011","Green Energy And Technology","Unlike alternative energy sources, or energy efficiency measures, carbon sequestration can only act to reduce CO2 atmospheric concentrations; it does not help solve our energy problems, and may even add to them. Several sequestration approaches are possible. Carbon capture and storage can only be applied to present emissions from large CO2 emitting sources such as power stations. Another possible approach is to capture CO2 directly from the air. Carbon sequestration in forests, soils, or in ocean plankton, are of this type, as is mechanical air capture. Mechanical air capture can in principle also draw down past CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, and even compensate for emissions of other greenhouse gases. However, the energy costs for capture are very high, so that energy availability becomes a problem. The sequestration phase is the same as for CO2 from fossil fuel combustion. Sequestering CO2 in the deep ocean would lead to both ocean acidification and adverse consequences for marine life. Estimates for the quantity of CO2 that can be ultimately sequestered in geological formations such as disused oil and gas fields, and saline aquifers, both on land and in the seabed, vary by orders of magnitude. But such estimates may be beside the point, since sequestration requires not only that adequate safe geological storage capacity be available, but that CO2 can be safely introduced at the rate desired, which could amount worldwide to tens of Gigatonne of CO2 per year. Furthermore, there is a small risk of catastrophic blowout from injection wells, which means that local citizen opposition could be intense.",NA,"2011.9248",NA,""
"Oceans, IUU Fishing, and Climate Change: Implications for International Law","Voigt, Christina","2020","International Community Law Review","Illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing poses a significant threat to marine fisheries and biodiversity only outpaced by the projected impacts of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Ocean warming might affect fish stocks, their health and migratory routes. Ocean acidification and de-oxygenation are another two phenomena that might affect certain marine species as well as entire marine ecosystems. Rebuilding of overexploited and depleted fisheries and managing fisheries sustainably will require comprehensive governance structures for port, flag, coastal and market states, which also address the causes and impacts of climate change. Addressing those concerns could open for opportunities for comprehensive and synergetic regulation. This article addresses potential synergies between oceans and climate governance; focusing on the role of oceans in addressing climate change and its adverse impacts. Suggestions to this end include (i) increasing ocean-based renewable energy, (ii) de-carbonizing ocean-based transport, and (iii) pursuing integrated management of fisheries and aquaculture.","Government \& Law","2020.3787",NA,""
"Using flue gas to mitigate ocean acidification","Patel, S.","2011","Power","Researchers from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL) Carbon Management Program and the University of California, Santa Cruz found that seawater and calcium could effectively remove most of the CO2 from a natural gas power plant's flue gas stream. A large fraction of the captured gas could then be converted into dissolved calcium bicarbonate - which, pumped into the sea, could be beneficial to the ocean's marine life. The results mean that above-ground CO2 hydration and mineral carbonate scrubbing may provide a ""relatively simple"" point-source CO2 capture and storage system at coastal locations. According to Greg Rau, a senior scientist with the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz who also works at LLNL, such low-tech CO2 mitigation could be especially relevant for retrofitting to existing power plants and for deployment in the developing world, the primary source of future CO2 emissions.",NA,"2011.9115","selected",""

"Fostering adaptive marine aquaculture through procedural innovation in marine spatial planning","Craig, Robin Kundis","2019","Marine Policy","Worldwide, as wild-caught commercial fisheries plateau and human demands for protein increase, marine aquaculture is expanding. Much marine aquaculture is inherently adaptable to changing climatic and chemical conditions. Nevertheless, siting of marine aquaculture operations is subject to competing environmental, economic, and social demands upon and priorities for ocean space, while some forms of marine aquaculture can also impose other externalities on marine systems, such as pollution from wastes (nutrients) and antibiotics, consumption of wild fish as food, and introduction of non-native or genetically modified species. As a result, governmental policy decisions to promote both marine aquaculture that can adapt to a changing ocean and adaptive governance for that aquaculture can become contested, requiring attention to their social legitimacy. This article explores how the law can promote the adaptability of marine aquaculture to climate change and ocean acidification-adaptive marine aquaculture-while still preserving key rule-of-law values, such as public participation and accountability. Perhaps most obviously, law can establish substantive requirements for marine aquaculture that minimize its impacts, promoting marine resilience overall. However, to foster truly adaptive marine aquaculture, including adaptive governance institutions, coastal nations should also procedurally reform their marine spatial planning efforts to legally connect the procedures for aquaculture permitting, marine spatial planning (MSP), and adaptive management. The goals for such connections, moreover, should be to mandate new forums for public participation and creative collaboration, promote experimentation with accountability that leads to increased knowledge, and foster the emergence of adaptive governance regarding the use of marine space.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; International Relations","2019.1072",NA,""
"Impacts of wetland dieback on carbon dynamics: A comparison between intact and degraded mangroves","Senger, D.F. and Saavedra Hortua, D.A. and Engel, S. and Schnurawa, M. and Moosdorf, N. and Gillis, L.G.","2021","Science Of The Total Environment","Mangroves are effective blue carbon sinks and are the most carbon rich ecosystems on earth. However, their areal extent has declined by over one-third in recent decades. Degraded mangrove forests result in reduced carbon captured and lead to release of stored carbon into the atmosphere by CO2 emission. The aim of this study was to assess changes in carbon dynamics in a gradually degrading mangrove forest on Bonaire, Dutch Caribbean. Remote sensing techniques were applied to estimate the distribution of intact and degraded mangroves. Forest structure, sediment carbon storage, sediment CO2 effluxes and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon in pore and surface waters across intact and degraded parts were assessed. On average intact mangroves showed 31% sediment organic carbon in the upper 30 cm compared to 20% in degraded mangrove areas. A loss of 1.51 MgCO2 haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 for degraded sites was calculated. Water samples showed a hypersaline environment in the degraded mangrove area averaging 93 which may have caused mangrove dieback. Sediment CO2 efflux within degraded sites was lower than values from other studies where degradation was caused by clearing or cutting, giving new insights into carbon dynamics in slowly degrading mangrove systems. Results of water samples agreed with previous studies where inorganic carbon outwelled from mangroves might enhance ecosystem connectivity by potentially buffering ocean acidification locally. Wetlands will be impacted by a variety of stressors resulting from a changing climate. Results from this study could inform scientists and stakeholders on how combined stresses, such as climate change with salinity intrusion may impact mangrove's blue carbon sink potential and highlight the need of future comparative studies of intact versus degraded mangrove stands.

Following concerns that the key messages from these studies were not reaching the public, a comprehensive opinion poll of 10,000 European citizens in 10 countries was conducted to establish levels of awareness, concern, and trust among different demographic groups (by age, gender, proximity to the coast) and nationalities. Citizens exhibited varying levels of self-declared ``informedness{''} and concern. Citizens from Germany, Italy and Spain claimed to be the most informed on marine climate change issues; those from Czech Republic, Netherlands and Estonia claimed to be least informed. Respondents were least aware of ocean acidification and most aware of melting sea ice, pollution and overfishing. Citizens of Italy suggested that they were generally most concerned about marine climate change issues. Respondents from coastal areas claimed to be both more informed and more concerned than those living inland, as did females and older age groups (54-64 years). European citizens obtain information about climate change in the seas and ocean from different sources, particularly television and the internet. Trust in the various media sources varies among countries and demographic groups. Television is trusted most in Estonia, Germany and Ireland and least in France. The internet is trusted most in Italy, Czech Republic and Estonia, but least in France and the United Kingdom. 18-24 year olds are the biggest users of the internet, but trust this source less than older age groups. Academic scientists or those working for environmental NGOs are trusted more than scientists working for government or industry. Citizens from France are more trusting of industry than any other country polled. In terms of policy actions, most respondents highlighted mitigation measures as opposed to local-scale adaptation. Younger participants prioritized actions associated with reducing carbon emissions, whereas older age groups prioritized improving coastal defenses. Successful adaptation to the impacts of climate change requires public engagement and support for policy decisions, and the use of different approaches to take account of differences among demographic groups and nationalities.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2017.490",NA,""

Recent arguments that ocean policies disregard a mature conservation research field and that protected areas cannot address climate change may be oversimplistic at this time when dynamic solutions for the management of changing oceans are needed. We propose a novel approach, based on spatial meta-analysis of climate impact models, to improve the positioning of marine protected areas to limit CCOA impacts. We do this by estimating the vulnerability of ocean ecosystems to CCOA in a spatially explicit manner and then co-mapping human activities such as the placement of renewable energy developments and the distribution of marine protected areas. We test this approach in the NE Atlantic considering also how CCOA impacts the base of the food web which supports protected species, an aspect often neglected in conservation studies. We found that, in this case, current regional conservation plans protect areas with low ecosystem-level vulnerability to CCOA, but disregard how species may redistribute to new, suitable and productive habitats. Under current plans, these areas remain open to commercial extraction and other uses. Here, and worldwide, ocean conservation strategies under CCOA must recognize the long-term importance of these habitat refuges, and studies such as this one are needed to identify them. Protecting these areas creates adaptive, climate-ready and ecosystem-level policy options for conservation, suitable for changing oceans.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2016.946","selected",""

Although the relevance of implementing adaptation strategies is widely recognized, studies on firms' adaptation to climate change are still in their infancy, especially regarding small and medium enterprises. Following a multi-stage approach, we analyze how small and medium enterprises in the marine food industry could adapt to climate-induced ocean acidification through product innovation. First, we use a co-production process with the firms' representatives to gain insights into the industry's adaptation opportunities, in which product innovation arises as the preferred strategy. Second, using a Discrete Choice Experiment, we test if consumers value both the mussels' attributes likely affected by ocean acidification (sensory and nutritional) and the proposed new products developed to adapt to it. We also analyze preferences' heterogeneity through a latent class model. Our results show that consumers value the attributes potentially affected by ocean acidification. We found high heterogeneity in consumer preferences regarding product types, disentangled into two classes (non-innovative consumers and consumers willing to innovate). We suggest that the industry could base its adaptation strategy on two pillars: 1) maintain the traditional format, thus satisfying 21\% of the market (non-innovative consumers); 2) direct the innovation efforts towards the canned format, thus satisfying those consumers willing to innovate (79\% of the market). Although consumers willing to innovate are prone to try new formats, the preferred alternatives are not radical innovations.","Science \& Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2022.61",NA,""

(1) Islander perceptions of climate change and the information sources on which these are based. (2) Migration to richer countries, which dominates popular media articles, so that scholars from a wide range of disciplines have given their perspectives on it.

"Utilization of ocean water for CO2capture via amine scrubbing","Ratanpara, A.P. and Shaw, A. and Deshpande, S. and Kim, M.","2020","Proceedings Of The International Conference On Offshore Mechanics And Arctic Engineering - Omae","As the consumption of fossil fuel resources has continuously increased to meet global fuel demands for power generation, atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), have rapidly increased over the last century. Increased CO2 emissions have caused serious international concerns about global warming, sea-level rise, and ocean acidification. Although post-combustion carbon capture technology that separates CO2 from flue gas in fossil fuel-fired power plants has contributed to significant migration of atmospheric CO2 emissions, this approach generates considerable amounts of toxic wastewater containing a heavy chemical which is difficult to treat, raises concerns about acute corrosion of metal structures in the facility, and waste of significant amounts of freshwater. In this research, we are particularly interested in reducing the use of freshwater for CO2 capture and generating carbonate minerals, byproducts of CO2 with calcium (Ca2+) or magnesium ions (Mg2+) in ocean water which are useful building blocks for marine animals, such as seashells and coral reefs. In our experimental approach, we attempted to use ocean water with different monoethanolamine (MEA) concentrations and compared the CO2 capturing efficiency with that in DI water. We found that there are considerable benefits of the use of ocean water in CO2 dissolution, showing that a replacement of freshwater with ocean water would be a possible option. In the future, we will further enhance the dissolution of CO2 in ocean water by using nanoparticle catalysts without using MEA, which will be an environmentally friendly method for CO2 capture.
