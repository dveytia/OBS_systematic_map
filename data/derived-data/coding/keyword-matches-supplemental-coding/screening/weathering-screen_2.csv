"Use of aircraft in ocean alkalinity enhancement","Gentile, E. and Tarantola, F. and Lockley, A. and Vivian, C. and Caserini, S.","2022","Science Of The Total Environment","Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) is a proposed Negative Emissions Technology (NET) to remove atmospheric CO2 through the dispersion of alkaline materials (e.g.: calcium hydroxide, slaked lime, SL) into seawater, simultaneously counteracting ocean acidification. This study considers aircraft discharge of SL and its consequent dry deposition, extending to the marine environment a technique used in freshwater. A feasibility analysis assesses potential, costs, benefits, and disadvantages, considering scenarios with different assumptions on aircraft size, discharge height and duration, and wind conditions. Due to the small size of SL particles (median diameter 9 Î¼m), the dispersion from aircraft is highly enhanced by wind drift; the smallest SL particles may drift thousands of kilometres, especially if discharged from elevated altitudes. This could pose problems related to powders particles settling on remote lands. Although calcium hydroxide maximum concentration into water (from 0.01 to 82 mg Lâˆ’1) is for almost all the scenarios lower than the most stringent threshold for the ecosystem impacts on a 96-h exposure, the ecologically sensitive sea surface microlayer (SML) should be considered in detail. The high CO2 emissions of the Landing to Take-Off Cycle (LTO) of the aircraft and their limited payload lead to a significant CO2 penalty, ranging in analysed scenarios between 28% and 77% of the CO2 removal potential; very fast discharge could reduce the penalty to 11% - 32%. Preliminary cost analysis shows that the cost of the SL discharge through aircraft is high, between â‚¬ 30 and â‚¬ 1846 per ton of CO2 removed (neglecting the lime cost), substantially higher than the cost for discharge by surface vessels resulting from previous studies, which restricts the practical use of this strategy.

"Assessing the potential of calcium-based artificial ocean alkalinization to mitigate rising atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidification","Ilyina, T. and Wolf-Gladrow, D. and Munhoven, G. and Heinze, C.","2013","Geophysical Research Letters","Enhancement of ocean alkalinity using calcium compounds, e.g., lime has been proposed to mitigate further increase of atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidification due to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Using a global model, we show that such alkalinization has the potential to preserve pH and the saturation state of carbonate minerals at close to today's values. Effects of alkalinization persist after termination: Atmospheric CO2 and pH do not return to unmitigated levels. Only scenarios in which large amounts of alkalinity (i.e., in a ratio of 2:1 with respect to emitted CO 2) are added over large ocean areas can boost oceanic CO2 uptake sufficiently to avoid further ocean acidification on the global scale, thereby elevating some key biogeochemical parameters, e.g., pH significantly above preindustrial levels. Smaller-scale alkalinization could counteract ocean acidification on a subregional or even local scale, e.g., in upwelling systems. The decrease of atmospheric CO2 would then be a small side effect.

"Ocean alkalinity enhancement - avoiding runaway CaCO3 precipitation during quick and hydrated lime dissolution","Moras, Charly A. and Bach, Lennart T. and Cyronak, Tyler and Joannes-Boyau, Renaud and Schulz, Kai G.","2022","Biogeosciences","Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a method that can remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and counteract ocean acidification through the dissolution of alkaline minerals. Currently, critical knowledge gaps exist regarding the dissolution of different minerals suitable for OAE in natural seawater. Of particular importance is to understand how much alkaline mineral can be dissolved before secondary precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) occurs, since secondary CaCO3 precipitation reduces the atmospheric CO2 uptake potential of OAE. Using two types of mineral proposed for OAE, quick lime (CaO) and hydrated lime (Ca(OH)(2)), we show that both (<63 mu m of diameter) dissolved in seawater within a few hours. No CaCO3 precipitation occurred at a saturation state (Omega(A)) of similar to 5, but CaCO3 precipitation in the form of aragonite occurred above an Omega(A) value of 7. This limit is lower than expected for typical pseudo-homogeneous precipitation, i.e. in the presence of colloids and organic matter. Secondary precipitation at low Omega(A) ( similar to 7) was the result of heterogeneous precipitation onto mineral surfaces, most likely onto the added CaO and Ca(OH)(2) particles. Most importantly, runaway CaCO3 precipitation was observed, a condition where significantly more total alkalinity (TA) was removed than initially added. Such runaway precipitation could reduce the OAE CO2 uptake efficiency from similar to 0.8 mol of CO2 per mole of added TA down to 0.1 mol of CO2 per mole of TA. Runaway precipitation appears to be avoidable by dilution below the critical Omega(A) threshold of 5, ideally within hours of the mineral additions to minimise initial CaCO3 precipitation. Finally, OAE simulations suggest that for the same Omega(A) threshold, the amount of TA that can be added to seawater would be more than 3 times higher at 5 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. The maximum TA addition could also be increased by equilibrating the seawater to atmospheric CO2 levels (i.e. to a pCO(2) of similar to 416 mu atm) during addition. This would allow for more TA to be added in seawater without inducing CaCO3 precipitation, using OAE at its CO2 removal potential.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Geology","2022.2020","selected",""
"The Availability of Limestone and Other Raw Materials for Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement","Caserini, S. and Storni, N. and Grosso, M.","2022","Global Biogeochemical Cycles","The work assesses the availability and localizations of different raw materials suitable for ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE), like limestone, olivine, magnesite and brucite, since several billion tons of rocky materials are needed to achieve meaningful results for carbon sequestration through OAE. Resources of carbonates are immense and widespread around all continents. Availability of pure carbonates is still very large (outcrop area 4.1 million km2) and is not a constraint for the large-scale development of OAE. Outcrops of pure carbonates within 10Â km from the coastline and below bare ground or scrub/shrub, preferred for the logistics of exploitation, account for about 70,000Â km2, and could provide about 5,000Â Gt of limestone. These values increase by a factor of 3 and 8 within 50 and 100Â km from the coastline, respectively. Potential resources of olivine, less easily identifiable from the geological data, are estimated in the order of a few hundred billion tons and could provide only a minor contribution to ocean-based carbon removal strategies. A comparison with the current level of world extraction of mineral raw materials is also provided. The annual production of limestone, estimated to be more than 6.6Â Gt from deposits scattered all around the world, is about 9% of the world production of mineral raw materials (around 44Â Gt yrâˆ’1), and is of the same order of magnitude as coal (7.3Â Gt yrâˆ’1). The annual productions of magnesite (29Â Mt yrâˆ’1), olivine (8.4Â Mt yrâˆ’1) and brucite (1.5Â Mt yrâˆ’1) are two orders of magnitude lower. Â© 2022 The Authors.",NA,"2022.4772","selected",""
