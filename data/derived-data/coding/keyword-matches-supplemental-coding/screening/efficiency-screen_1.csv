Shore power as a first step toward shipping decarbonization and related policy impact on a dry bulk cargo carrier,"Daniel, Hugo and Trovao, Joao Pedro F. and Williams, David",2022,Etransportation,"Maritime shipping currently emits 2.89\% of the world greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and it is estimated that the sector will reach the road transportation level by 2060. International environmental regulations push the industry to lower their GHG emissions, but the feasibility and viability of future green energy is uncertain. This paper presents a road towards green maritime shipping by proposing shore power, also known as cold ironing or alternative marine power, as a key measure to decarbonize the industry. Therefore, transition pathways and the available measures to decarbonize the industry are analyzed. A theoretical description of shore power along with a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis of the technology is discussed. The paper is also supported with a test case on a real bulk carrier to measure the score improvement of shore power on the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and the Carbon Intensity Index (CII). In summary, shore power can reduce GHG and air polluting emissions at ports right now and across the world. The case of study determined that shore power could improve CII by 7.8\% and policy modifications have been presented to include shore power in EEDI and EEXI calculations. Most of all, shore power can eliminate 100\% of emissions of ships at berth right now. Furthermore, shore power is a prime mover for the development of new maritime applications like hybridization and electrification. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Hybrid Electric Solutions for Marine Applications,"Kanerva, Sami",2021,NANA,"The transition to a sustainable economy is one of the major undertakings in human history. Meeting the International Maritime Organization's goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions from ships by 2050 is a critical step toward sustainability. It will require a comprehensive and proactive response from the maritime community. Shipping is well positioned to take concrete action by choosing to implement technologies that provide reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions. Technical solutions to improve energy efficiency and to decarbonize shipping are increasingly leading towards electrification in marine applications. Electric propulsion enables to optimize the power production under varying load profiles, and simplifies integration of energy storage systems and alternative power sources. In marine power distribution, DC grid solutions are gaining popularity and increasing the content of power electronics in shipboard power systems. Strict regulations and requirements to cut emissions are accelerating investments in renewable hydrogen and electrofuels. Accordingly, the marine industry is undergoing a rapid transition from fossil to alternative low-carbon fuels. This will introduce fuel cells as a credible alternative to internal combustion engines, and further increasing the share of electric power distribution semiconductorbased power conversion.",Energy \& Fuels; Engineering,2021.3007,selected,
Hydraulic design and performance analysis on a small pump-turbine system for ocean renewable energy storage system,"Singh, P.M. and Chen, Z. and Choi, Y.-D.",2017,Journal Of Mechanical Science And Technology,"Korea has a myriad of islands in the south western coast that extensively rely on diesel generators for power production, which increase cost and environment pollution. The small hydro pump-turbine system for ocean renewable energy storage system is a kind of hybrid system that can reduce the usage of diesel generators and help to contribute to the environment in a positive manner by helping to reduce carbon emissions. The study focuses on initial hydraulic design and numerical analysis of a 30 kW-class pump-turbine system for energy independent islands in South Korea. The purpose of the study is to propose an ocean renewable energy storage system using a small pump-turbine system working with seawater. A 30 kW-class pump-turbine does not require a large head; approximately 30 m is sufficient for the design and application. Several other renewable energy systems like wind turbines, tidal turbines, wave energy converters and solar energy could be used to make a hybrid system with pump-turbine. The initial design achieved more than 85 % efficiency in both pump and turbine modes. However, further optimizations of the impeller blade shape and number of guide vane and stay vanes could improve the overall efficiency of the system.

Stand-alone island daily power management using a tidal turbine farm and an ocean compressed air energy storage system,"Sheng, L. and Zhou, Z. and Charpentier, J.F. and Benbouzid, M.E.H.",2017,Renewable Energy,"Due to the high predictability and the high energy density, marine tidal resource has become an area of increasing interest with various academic and industrial projects around the world. In fact, several Marine Current Turbine (MCT) farm projects with multi-megawatt capacity are planned to be installed in the coming years. In this paper, a MCT farm is supposed to be the main energy supply for a stand-alone island. To compensate the MCT farm power variation relating to the tidal phenomenon, an Ocean Compressed Air Energy Storage (OCAES) system is considered to achieve the island power management. The novelty in this work is that conventional Diesel Generators (DGs) would only serve as a backup supply while the main island power supply will be fulfilled by the proposed hybrid MCT/OCAES system. A simplified OCAES model is built-up in this paper with cycle efficiency about 60.6%. Simulations under different working conditions are carried out to validate the feasibility of the hybrid power system. The obtained results show that the proposed system power management can greatly help to decrease DG fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emission. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd",NA,2017.13607,selected,
Green technologies for offshore industry,"Roa, M.",2016,"Offshore Technology Conference Asia 2016, Otca 2016","Environmental technological innovations driven by the evolving regulatory landscape have the potential to provide performance solutions for the next generation of offshore vessels. Future historians may look back at the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, Annex VI (MARPOL) requirements as one of the most important pieces of maritime legislation passed. It sets in motion a series of requirements that change the way vessels are designed and operated. For all practical purposes, the offshore industry may be revolutionized by the confluence of Annex VI requirements which limit the amount of sulfur in fuel oil, limit the amount of nitrogen oxides emitted from the engine combustion process, and reduce CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. The economics of alternative fuels such as LNG and the imperatives of operating in Emission Control Areas (ECA) are driving innovative vessel designs. Offshore vessel operators of the world can greatly benefit by adopting green technologies such as renewable energy, alternative fuels, hybrid propulsion and power generation plants, and advanced environmental systems. This paper will outline a number of emission pollutant driven and energy efficiency driven green ship technologies currently being adopted in offshore vessel design, and considers the opportunities this presents for future designs.

Optimizing hybrid offshore wind farms for cost-competitive hydrogen production in Germany,"Scolaro, M. and Kittner, N.",2022,International Journal Of Hydrogen Energy,"Nearly 96% of the world's current hydrogen production comes from fossil-fuel-based sources, contributing to global greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen is often discussed as a critical lever in decarbonizing future power systems. Producing hydrogen using unsold offshore wind electricity may offer a low-carbon production pathway and emerging business model. This study investigates whether participating in an ancillary service market is cost competitive for offshore wind-based hydrogen production. It also determines the optimal size of a hydrogen electrolyser relative to an offshore wind farm. Two flexibility strategies for offshore wind farms are developed in this study: an optimal bidding strategy into ancillary service markets for offshore wind farms that build hydrogen production facilities and optimal sizing of Power-to-Hydrogen (PtH) facilities at wind farms. Using empirical European power market and wind generation data, the study finds that offshore-wind based hydrogen must participate in ancillary service markets to generate net positive revenues at current levels of wind generation to become cost competitive in Germany. The estimated carbon abatement cost of â€œgreenâ€ hydrogen ranges between 187 EUR/tonCO2e and 265 EUR/tonCO2e. Allowing hydrogen producers to receive similar subsidies as offshore wind farms that produce only electricity could facilitate further cost reduction. Utilizing excess and intermittent offshore wind highlights one possible pathway that could achieve increasing returns on greenhouse gas emission reductions due to technological learning in hydrogen production, even under conditions where low power prices make offshore wind less competitive in the European electricity market.

Hybrid Offshore Power Generation,"Iqbar, I.Md. and Taib, H. and Hamdan, M.F. and Adam, F. and Beyer, M.",2021,"Spe Middle East Oil And Gas Show And Conference, Meos, Proceedings","Amid 2020 challenging business environments due to COVID-19 pandemic and strong global push towards transition to cleaner energy, PETRONAS has declared its' aspiration to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. PETRONAS sustainability journey has begun for more than two decades and with strong management support towards renewable and as part of PETRONAS's technology agenda, its' research arm, PETRONAS Research Sdn. Bhd. (PRSB) has been working on ways to use renewable energy sources for offshore oil and gas platforms in Malaysia. Oil and Gas industry has long relied on turbine generators for offshore power generation. These turbo-fired machineries are operating as microgrid with existing power management system (PMS) as microgrid controllers. They normally use either gas or diesel as fuel gas to ensure reliable power generation where high maintence cost is expected to operate these generators. Also, they have low energy efficiency and hence, usually oversized to ensure meeting the demand reliably. Typically, the power generation load is being taken by two units of turbine generators with another unit as spare. This has resulted in high operational expenditure (OPEX) and contributes to high levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for offshore power generation for such conventional system. LCOE is the yardstick for power generation technology, and it measures discounted lifecycle cost consisting of both capital expenditure (CAPEX) and OPEX, divided by discounted lifecycle of annual energy production [2], [4], [5]. Also, these turbine generators operating at platforms that have gas evacuation pipelines will use up precious fuel gas which can otherwise be sold. This will have impact on the total sales gas revenue. Not withstanding, the burning of the fuel gas will result in the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and hence is exposed to carbon tax. To mitigate this issue, PRSB has developed an offshore hybrid power generation concept to leverage and optimize wind turbine system for offshore power generation in weak wind area such as Malaysia. In this concept, one gas turbine generator is replaced by an offshore wind turbine adapted to low wind speed region. This will lower the maintenance cost and carbon exposure. Also, the fuel gas will be diverted to sales gas. This in turn will improve the economics of the renewable solution thereby making offshore renewable power generation feasible for oil and gas platforms. Forward thinking efforts include pushing the limits of harnessing wind energy in weak wind area such as Malaysia. In here, considerations of a total solution include not only the type of wind turbine generator that can be adapted to weak wind area and having the lowest maintenance requirements as possible, but also looking into cutting edge foundation technologies. The LCOE is expected to be lower than conventional power generation. To ensure optimized hybrid concept, careful selection and adaptations of wind turbine system and its' substructure are required to achieve a cost-effective solution [3], [2]. Conceptual engineering and front-end engineering design were conducted which resulted in the development of the hybrid offshore power generation system. In this paper, the hybrid concept will be shown, the considerations for selection of a suitable wind turbine will be shared and the decisions leading the to the selection and optimization of the foundation type, either fixed bottom or floating are elaborated.

Techno-energy-economic assessment of a high capacity offshore wind-pumped-storage hybrid power system for regional power system,"Liu, X. and Li, N. and Mu, H. and Li, M. and Liu, X.",2021,Journal Of Energy Storage,"Developing offshore wind powerâ€”one of the most promising renewable energy sourcesâ€”is considered to be an effective measure by China to promote energy transformation and achieve carbon neutrality. The integration of offshore wind with energy storage facilities can improve wind energy opportunities and mitigate the disharmony between energy generation and supply. This study develops a mathematical model to optimise a high capacity offshore wind-pumped-storage hybrid power system with Non-dominant Sorting Genetic Algorithm with Elite Strategy (NSGA-â…¡). We optimised various objects and compared the results. The results showed that the positive effects of increased electricity sales revenue could not always balance the negative effects of increased investments after configuring energy storage. Moreover, the simulation of the pumping state, discharging state, and state of charge (SOC) examined the system performance. The annual energy distribution analysed quantitively the reservoirs utilisation frequency and energy utilisation efficiency, which revealed the effect of design variables on pumping and discharging operation. Additionally, the effects of system stability constraints and load demand levels on the economic benefits, system performance, and CO2 emission reduction were compared and analysed. The adaptability of the optimal configurations to high load demand was tested. Finally, the sensitivity analysis provided clear guidance on external financial parameters for subsidy backslope.

Innovative Hybrid Energy System for stable Power and eat Supply in offshore oil \& gas Installation (HES-OFF): System Design and Grid Stability,"Riboldi, Luca and Alves, Erick F. and Pilarczyk, Marcin and Tedeschi, Elisabetta and Nord, Lars O.",2020,NANA,This paper presents an innovative hybrid energy system for stable power and heat supply in offshore oil \& gas installations (HES-OFF). The hybrid concept integrates offshore wind power with gas turbines and a H-2 energy storage solution based on proton exchange membrane fuel cells and electrolysers. The objectives are: 1) improve the environmental performance of offshore installations by maximizing the exploitation of offshore wind and partially decarbonizing the gas turbines by co-feeding H-2; 2) minimize the negative effects that wind power variability has on the electrical grid frequency stability. This study presents a first assessment of the HES-OFF concept performance using an offshore platform in the North Sea as case study. The results show that the HES-OFF concept: 1) cuts CO2 emissions up to 40 \% when compared to the reference case but requires large H-2 storage capacity to fully exploit wind power throughout the year; 2) allows higher wind power penetration without infringing on the grid frequency requirements.,Computer Science; Engineering,2020.17876,selected,
Design and evaluation of LNG-hydrogen hybrid propulsion system for LNG carrier,"Jeong, J. and Seo, S. and Chang, D.",2017,Proceedings Of The International Offshore And Polar Engineering Conference,"Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) in International Maritime Organization (IMO) is regulating the CO2 emission from vessels by an established index called the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). The EEDI is applied to every ocean-going vessel and ratified to be stringent with respect to time; the CO2 emission should be reduced by 30 % in 2022 (Phase 3) and by 40 % in 2025 (Phase 4) from the emission level of 2013. Although the LNG-fuelled propulsion system has been developed to reduce the green-house gas emission, it hardly meet the regulation in Phase 4, and consequently some fuel without green-house gas emission should be combined with LNG. This study proposes the LNG-hydrogen hybrid system of a LNG carrier with 154K, 210K, and 267K cargo capacity and discusses some issues including the relative ratio of hydrogen with respect to LNG, the size of hydrogen fuel tanks, and operating complexities to satisfy the step-by-step regulations. An appropriate ratio of hydrogen fuel to satisfy the environmental regulation is estimated to more than 12% and 27% for Phase 4 and 5 respectively. The tank size of liquid hydrogen for the ship is estimated 1,300 âˆ¼ 3,300 m3, and the power of a fuel cell is required to be 4.9 âˆ¼ 11.8 MW. Optimising the hybrid propulsion system considering the spatial, operational, and economic feasibility for the hybrid propulsion system is identified as a future challenge.

Reducing cost and environmental impacts through hybrid power options,"Lindstad, H. and Eskeland, G.S. and MÃ¸rch, H.J. and Psaraftis, H. and Sandaas, I.",2015,"Sname 5th World Maritime Technology Conference, Wmtc 2015","Power solutions for seagoing vessels have typically been designed to enable operation at maximum economic speeds based on hydrodynamic considerations, and to ensure that vessels have the necessary power to be seaworthy and maneuverable in heavy weather and in high sea states. Historically, fuel costs have been low compared to fixed and other variable costs, but more recently, rising fuel prices and environmental concerns have made it more attractive to reduce fuel consumption through lower steaming speeds. Since speed reduction drastically reduces power requirements, it has become common to operate at 15 to 50% of the installed power in calm to moderate sea conditions. When engines operate at low power, fuel consumption per kWh produced power increases slightly, while the emissions of exhaust gases increase rapidly due to incomplete combustion. This study investigates flexible hybrid power solutions, i.e. power take out (PTO), power take in (PTI) and batteries in combination with internal combustion engines. The focus is on the full operational range from being idle at berth to the peak power needed in critical situations in high sea states. Our results indicate that hybrid solutions are cost-competitive with traditional engine setups. They also reduce the environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions and cost effectively satisfies IMOâ€™s energy efficiency requirements (EEDI).

An alternative and hybrid propulsion for merchant ships: current state and perspective,"Jelic, Maro and Mrzljak, Vedran and Radica, Gojmir and Racic, Nikola",2021,"Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization And Environmental Effects","The maritime industry is becoming increasingly aware of the global environmental impact of ships and is being forced, by international legislation, to gradually reduce its emissions. International Maritime Organization conventions and energy efficiency standards set challenges to shipping sector, to ship owners and ship designers, and to offer propulsion concepts that will effectively reduce or completely eliminate emission rates and increase energy efficiency with acceptable technological costs and adjustment time. New concepts include environmental-friendly fuels in existing propulsion architecture, hybrid propulsion, and all-electric propulsion architecture with the possible application of renewable energy sources, which are reviewed in this paper. Each concept has advantages and disadvantages regarding adjustment time, implementation cost and energy storage system capacity. One of the main disadvantages for complete replacement of conventional propulsion systems is the limited energy storage capacity of existing storage devices, which would decrease the operational ability of the shipping sector as a cheap transportation solution on the global market. Such problems and unsolved environmental issues regarding the production and recycling of energy storage devices are highlighted in this paper and must be further developed. The main motivation for the paper's work is to offer a detailed review of possible solutions for ship propulsion and to offer direction for further research. This is obtained by applying a literature review method to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each proposed solution. The results are discussed in the last section of the paper with the final conclusion that the internal combustion engines will not be completely replaced in the shipping sector in terms of the next few decades but will be able to use environmental-friendly fuels or fuels without a global carbon footprint. This conclusion is the result of analyzing especially large ocean-going vessels with very strong internal combustion engines. Such high power and energy demand are not very easy to be replaced with alternative energy sources or with all-electric ship solution without decreasing all other advantages of merchant shipping sector. Forecasts of ambitious decarbonization scenarios predict wide usage of carbon-neutral fuels in the late 2030s or mid-2040s and Green House Gases reduction (in the range between 50% and 100%) in 2050, which can be obtained by using enviromental-friendly fuels in existing infrastructure. It is still hard to identify which carbon-neutral fuel will be dominant, but e-ammonia, blue ammonia, bio-methanol, and hydrogen are the most promising carbon-neutral fuels in the decarbonization path.

Powering Offshore Installations with Wind Energy,"MacDougall, B. and Nash, P. and Doyle, B. and Hudson, J. and Murphy, R. and Meyers, J.",2022,"Society Of Petroleum Engineers - Spe Canadian Energy Technology Conference, Cet 2022","The offshore Oil and Gas industry continues to explore and develop oil and gas fields using installations powered by generators burning either natural gas or marine gas oil (MGO), similar to diesel. There is increasing pressure on the industry to explore and produce hydrocarbons responsibly, cost effectively and with the lowest emissions. By employing renewable sources of power, Waterford Energy Services Inc.'s (WESI) methodology provides a possible solution using Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) to power offshore installations. Various methods are being proposed and developed to maintain production while bringing down overall greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. CO2, NOx, SOx). This paper outlines the methodology used for a conceptual design of a ""Plug and Play"" hybrid power solution in the Canadian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry. FOWTs are electrically connected to offshore installations such as Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODU), Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) and fixed production platforms in a harsh environment to replace large portions of the onboard power generation. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are incorporated to transition from wind power, increase efficiency, provide safety backup and enhance emissions reduction. The plan includes considerations for the optimal electrical and battery storage topology and the electrical equipment necessary to connect the FOWT Array to the offshore facility. For the purposes of this paper, a representative location was chosen offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada to assess both local conditions and design requirements. WESI has evaluated additional global locations for this FOWT solution. The conceptual design considers the wind turbine power output and examines the components required to deliver the power to the installation's electrical system (e.g. transformers, batteries, switchgear, static and dynamic cables, disconnects, communications/monitoring and required safety systems). Although there have been incremental improvements in emissions via advancements in fuel standards and engine exhaust abatement modifications, the only approach to have a significant step-change improvement in emissions is through replacement of onboard power generation with renewable sources. It anticipated that the installationsâ€™ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be reduced in excess of 70% by combining wind power and battery supplementation. Oil and Gas operations are ideal applications of this decarbonization approach, presenting an opportunity to mature FOWT technology which can readily adapt to other grid isolated applications such as Remote Communities, Aquaculture and near-shore Industries.

Sizing and Control of a Hybrid Ship Propulsion System Using Multi-Objective Double-Layer Optimization,"Wang, Xuezhou and Shipurkar, Udai and Haseltalab, Ali and Polinder, Henk and Claeys, Frans and Negenborn, Rudy R.",2021,Ieee Access,"Ship hybridization has received some interests recently in order to achieve the emission target by 2050. However, designing and optimizing a hybrid propulsion system is a complicated problem. Sizing components and optimizing energy management control are coupled with each other. This paper applies a nested double-layer optimization architecture to optimize the sizing and energy management of a hybrid offshore support vessel. Three different power sources, namely diesel engines, batteries and fuel cells, are considered which increases the complexity of the optimization problem. The optimal sizing of the components and their corresponding energy management strategies are illustrated. The effects of the operational profiles and the emission reduction targets on the hybridization design are studied for this particular type of vessel. The results prove that a small emission reduction target of about 10\% can be achieved by improving the diesel engine efficiency using the batteries only while the achievement of a larger emission reduction target mainly depends on the amount of the hydrogen and/or on-shore charging electricity consumed. Some design guidelines for hybridization are derived for this particular ship which could be also valid for other vessels with similar operational profiles.",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,2021.5704,selected,
FUEL CELLS IN DEEP-SEA SHIPPING: CHALLENGING PATH AHEAD,NA,2020,Motor Ship,"As regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions take effect step by step, the introduction of fuel cells to vessels is inevitable. In response to this, Samsung Heavy Industries' (SHI) Outfitting Team is working with New York-listed Bloom Energy to develop an Aframax tanker design powered by fuel cells running on natural gas. Fuel cells are capable of providing a zero-emission source of energy for deep-sea ships. However, until such marine fuel cell installations are optimized, power density, and therefore real estate required on board, will be a challenge compared to internal combustion engines. Two types are considered potentially most suitable for marine applications. First, low temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells provide high power density comparable with internal combustion engines. Solid oxide fuel cells, meanwhile, operate at high temperatures, creating opportunities for waste heat recovery, as well as the potential for more durable generators, greater fuel flexibility, and very high combined cycle efficiencies. The adoption of fuel cells will increase, initially for distributed power, then for integration with larger systems to meet continuous power demands, and ultimately for propulsion.

Comparative study of energy efficiency and cost optimization in low-emission marine power systems with alternative fuels,"Sletten, P.S. and Zadeh, M.",2022,"2022 Ieee Transportation Electrification Conference And Expo, Itec 2022","Marine hybrid power systems fed by so-called ""alternative fuels""are key enablers to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ship propulsion and reaching international targets, particularly for large vessels. In this paper, a few scenarios of green propulsion are studied based on low-emission energy carriers, marine batteries, and all-electric power architecture. A cost model is proposed to optimise the power system via minimising the fuel consumption and hence, the operational expenses (OPEX). The proposed cost model includes the different types of fuels and a battery cycling and battery energy dissipation term. The result is an optimal energy management system (EMS) based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that is tuned for alternative fuel. The optimised EMS is tested on a commercial LNG vessel, and it enables a more stable use of generators. However, as the paper reveals, optimised control strategies will not yield practical results in reaching international emission targets. Hence, alternative fuels will be pivotal in reducing emissions from shipping. Â© 2022 IEEE.",NA,2022.208,selected,
"Affordable CO2 negative emission through hydrogen from biomass, ocean liming, and CO2 storage","Caserini, Stefano and Barreto, Beatriz and Lanfredi, Caterina and Cappello, Giovanni and Morrey, Dennis Ross and Grosso, Mario",2019,Mitigation And Adaptation Strategies For Global Change,"A new process to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, by combining commercial industrial technologies with ocean liming and CO2 storage, is presented. The process aims to overcome the limiting factors of other negative emission technologies (cost and energy requirements, potential competition for land and freshwater) while simultaneously addressing the problem of ocean acidification. The overall proposed process is based on the following: (a) a gasifier where the biomass is converted to syngas; (b) a thermal steam reformer working at high temperature where the hydrocarbons and tar oils are converted to hydrogen (H-2) and carbon monoxide (CO); (c) a kiln to produce Ca(OH)(2) (slaked lime) from limestone by using the enthalpy of the hot syngas; (d) the spreading, by means of vessels, of the slaked lime into the seawater to achieve ocean liming; (e) the delivery of syngas to a water gas shift reactor producing CO2 and H-2 that are then separated; (f) the final storage of all CO2 produced in the process; (g) the use of H-2, being the valuable by-product of the whole process, for decarbonized energy production as well as for ammonia synthesis, offsetting part of the production cost, thus generating ``low-cost{''} negative emissions. The mass and energy balances show that the total atmospheric CO2 removed by the process is 2.6 ton per ton of biomass used. By adding an estimated 0.43 ton avoided-thanks to the use of produced H-2-the overall CO2 benefit of the process increases to 3.0 ton per ton of biomass. A preliminary cost analysis resulted in an average levelized cost of 98 \$ per ton of CO2 removed; when considering the revenues from the produced energy, the cost falls to 64 \$/tCO(2). The higher efficiency in carbon removal obtained allows to reduce the amount of biomass required by BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) to achieve negative emissions, and thanks to the valuable H-2 produced it lowers the costs of CO2 removal from the atmosphere.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology,2019.4859,selected,

However, gas turbines operate very inefficiently under the variable offshore conditions, increasing fuel costs and air pollutant emissions. This paper focused on investigating the feasibility of implementing a hybrid electricity supply system for offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, both for the United States and Mexico Exclusive Economic Zones. Geographic Information Systems methodologies were used to analyze the data from various sources. Three different scenarios were studied, including wind power only, wave power only, and wind and wave power combined. The results showed that all the offshore locations were within accepted feasible distance to the coast for connecting to the onshore grid. Most of the locations had acceptable power levels of either wind or wave energy while the combination of both resources can improve the overall energy harvesting efficiency and reduce the variability in a significant number of locations. The proposed methodology can be applied for specific locations with finer spatial and time resolution, which will allow stakeholders to improve the decision making process, generate important savings on the normal operation, reduce pollution, and potentially increase income by selling surplus energy from renewable sources.",Energy \& Fuels,2018.13246,selected,
Electroâ€technologies for energy efficiency improvement and low carbon emission in maritime transport,"Jayasinghe, S. and Lokuketagoda, G. and Enshaei, H. and Shagar, V. and Ranmuthugala, D.",2020,"Proceedings - 16th Annual General Assembly And Conference Of The International Association Of Maritime Universities, Iamu Aga 2015","The global share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships is on the rise which will become a significant portion leading to climate changes and other environmental issues unless reduction measures are taken. Therefore, the International Maritime Origination (IMO) and other regulatory bodies have set limits for emissions and defined emission controlled areas. As a result, alternative fuel such as Hydrogen and liquefied natural gas (LNG) that are low in greenhouse gas emission and competitive in cost are gradually being entered into the shipping industry. However, these alternative fuel technologies are still in the developing stage and the necessary infrastructure is not fully developed yet. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that majority of the ships continue to burn fossil fuel for the foreseeable future. A promising and viable solution for reducing the emissions is to reduce the fuel consumption through efficiency improvement. In this context, electro-technologies are shown to be capable of playing a vital role in improving fuel efficiency and thereby reducing emissions. The aim of this paper is to present a review on recent advancements of electro-technologies that help improve fuel efficiency of ships. A hybrid electric ship propulsion system is discussed as an example to show the potential of electro-technologies in improving the fuel efficiency.
