"Severe Coastal Hypoxia Interchange with Ocean Acidification: An Experimental Perturbation Study on Carbon and Nutrient Biogeochemistry","Kapetanaki, Natalia and Krasakopoulou, Evangelia and Stathopoulou, Eleni and Dassenakis, Manos and Scoullos, Michael","2020","Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering","Normally atmospheric CO2 is the major driver of ocean acidification (OA); however, local discharge/degradation of organic matter (OM) and redox reactions can exacerbate OA in coastal areas. In this work we study the response of nutrient and carbon systems to pH decrease in relation to hydrographically induced intermittent characteristics and examine scenarios for future ocean acidification in a coastal system. Laboratory microcosm experiments were conducted using seawater and surface sediment collected from the deepest part of Elefsis Bay; the pH was constantly being monitored while CO2 gas addition was adjusted automatically. In Elefsis Bay surface pCO(2) is already higher than global present atmospheric values, while near the bottom pCO(2) reaches 1538 mu atm and carbonate saturation states were calculated to be around 1.5. During the experiment, in more acidified conditions, limited alkalinity increase was observed and was correlated with the addition of bicarbonates and OM. Ammonium oxidation was decelerated and a nitrification mechanism was noticed, despite oxygen deficiency, paralleled by reduction of Mn-oxides. Phosphate was found significantly elevated for the first time in lower pH values, without reprecipitating after reoxygenation; this was linked with Fe(II) oxidation and Fe(III) reprecipitation without phosphate adsorption affecting both available dissolved phosphate and (dissolved inorganic nitrogen) DIN:DIP (dissolved inorganic phosphate)ratio.","Engineering; Oceanography","2020.7275","excluded",""
"Dwarf eelgrass (Zostera noltii) fatty acid remodelling induced by climate change","Franzitta, Marco and Repolho, Tiago and Paula, Jose Ricardo and Cacador, Isabel and Matos, Ana Rita and Rosa, Rui and Duarte, Bernardo","2021","Estuarine Coastal And Shelf Science","Dwarf eelgrass Zostera noltii meadows are found in estuarine coastal areas across the north-eastern Atlantic, where they provide key ecosystem services, including nursery grounds, sediment stabilization, nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration. These blue carbon ecosystems are being subjected to several anthropogenic pressures, including climate change-related effects. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical changes (fatty acid profiling) under different climate change scenarios (present-day conditions, ocean acidification, ocean warming and combined warming and acidification), following IPCC RCP scenario 8.5. Significant modifications in the percentage of saturated (SFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in response to warming and low pH levels were detected. The changes suggest a rearrangement of membrane composition to maintain membrane fluidity, especially under warming conditions. Individuals under warming treatment showed higher plastidial pathway activity, while acidification induced a shift in the fatty acid synthesis pathway towards the extraplastidial pathway, indicating a need to readjust the chloroplastidial monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) lipids under thermal stress to counteract excessive membrane fluidity. Regarding PUFA fatty acids, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3, n-3) showed a pronounced decrease under the combined treatment, a tendency that can be connected to reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching and membrane remodelling. Thus, and observing the changes in the fatty acid profile, these essential molecules appear as good candidate biomarkers to detect changes in seagrass ecophysiology under acute climate change-related events. Our findings suggest that future global warming will pose a serious threat to these already endangered blue ecosystems.","Marine \& Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","2021.5745",NA,""

"Response of Photosynthesis to Ocean Acidification","Mackey, Katherine R. M. and Morris, J. Jeffrey and Morel, Francois M. M. and Kranz, Sven A.","2015","Oceanography","All phytoplankton and higher plants perform photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide is incorporated into biomass during cell growth. Ocean acidification (OA) has the potential to affect photosynthetic kinetics due to increasing seawater pCO(2) levels and lower pH. The effects of increased CO, are difficult to predict because some species utilize carbon concentrating mechanisms that buffer their sensitivity to ambient CO, levels and require variable energy investments. Here, we discuss the current state of knowledge about the effects of increased CO2 on photosynthesis across marine photosynthetic taxa from cyanobacteria and single-celled eukaryotes to marine macrophytes. The analysis shows that photosynthetic responses to OA are relatively small for most investigated species and highly variable throughout taxa. This could suggest that the photosynthetic benefits of high CO2 are minor relative to the cell's overall energy and material balances, or that the benefit to photosynthesis is counteracted by other negative effects, such as possible respiratory costs from low pH. We conclude with recommendations for future research directions, such as probing how other physiological processes respond to OA, the effects of multiple stressors, and the potential evolutionary outcomes of longterm growth under ocean acidification.","Oceanography","2015.11418",NA,""
"The roles of macroalgae in climate change mitigation: Opportunities and challenges for marine-based carbon donor","Handayani, T. and Zulpikar, F. and Kusnadi, A.","2022","Iop Conference Series: Earth And Environmental Science","Anthropogenic activities will lead to an exponential increase in CO2 emissions in the future. Increased CO2 emissions have an impact on global climate patterns, ocean acidification, and ecosystem function. Marine vegetation has the potential to absorb CO2 through photosynthesis and store carbon in its biomass and sediments. This is known as blue carbon. Research on blue carbon in the world, including Indonesia, is more focused on seagrass and mangroves because including macroalgae carbon in the blue carbon strategy is still controversial. Currently, there are many considerations for including macroalgal carbon in the blue carbon strategy. Macroalgae have a shorter life cycle than seagrass and mangroves. In addition, macroalgae generally grow on hard substrates, resulting in lower levels of carbon storage than seagrass and mangroves. However, macroalgae can serve as carbon donors and contribute to the effort to mitigate climate change. In this review, we present the potential and challenges of macroalgae as carbon donors. Macroalgae will be significant as carbon donors if they have the following three criteria: high production of biomass; effective biomass moved to recipient habitat; and carbon donors that can be buried in recipient habitat. The fate of macroalgae carbon in recipient habitats still needs to be studied. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",NA,"2022.21382","selected",""
"Can Seaweed Farming Play a Role in Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation?","Duarte, Carlos M. and Wu, Jiaping and Xiao, Xi and Bruhn, Annette and Krause-Jensen, Dorte","2017","Frontiers In Marine Science","Seaweed aquaculture, the fastest-growing component of global food production, offers a slate of opportunities to mitigate, and adapt to climate change. Seaweed farms release carbon that maybe buried in sediments or exported to the deep sea, therefore acting as a CO2 sink. The crop can also be used, in total or in part, for biofuel production, with a potential CO2 mitigation capacity, in terms of avoided emissions from fossil fuels, of about 1,500 tons CO2 km(-2) year(-1). Seaweed aquaculture can also help reduce the emissions from agriculture, by improving soil quality substituting synthetic fertilizer and when included in cattle fed, lowering methane emissions from cattle. Seaweed aquaculture contributes to climate change adaptation by damping wave energy and protecting shorelines, and by elevating pH and supplying oxygen to the waters, thereby locally reducing the effects of ocean acidification and de-oxygenation. The scope to expand seaweed aquaculture is, however, limited by the availability of suitable areas and competition for suitable areas with other uses, engineering systems capable of coping with rough conditions offshore, and increasing market demand for seaweed products, among other factors. Despite these limitations, seaweed farming practices can be optimized to maximize climate benefits, which may, if economically compensated, improve the income of seaweed farmers.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2017.742","selected",""
"Towards adaptation measures in protecting mangroves from climate change","Field, C.","2011","Climate Change Adaptation: Ecology, Mitigation And Management","A brief account of the nature of mangrove ecosystems is given. This shows that mangroves are generally resilient to climate change and are aggressive colonizers if suitable land is available. An examination of the current worldwide status of mangrove ecosystems and loss of area shows that the quantification of worldwide mangrove area needs improvement. There is an analysis of the response of mangroves to changes in climate: rise in sea level, rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide, rise in air and water temperature, ocean acidification and change in precipitation and storm frequency. A significant lack of information exists on some aspects of these responses. The literature proposes a range of adaptation strategies to prevent the loss of mangrove ecosystems. In the main, these are concerned with the effects of sea level rise and involve planting mangroves, preserving space for mangrove migration or preventing erosion. An examination of these strategies shows the need for extensive local knowledge. Adaptation and mitigation strategies will be useless without an intimate understanding, both spatially and temporally, of the local physical, chemical and biological structures. Such information is often ignored or not available. The management of adaptation strategies requires knowledge of population pressure as well as the effects of climate change. In the near future, the impact of population growth and development is more likely than climate change to impinge on mangrove ecosystems. Â© 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

"Offshore CCS and ocean acidification: a global long-term probabilistic cost-benefit analysis of climate change mitigation","van der Zwaan, B. and Gerlagh, R.","2016","Climatic Change","Public fear over environmental and health impacts of CO2 storage, or over potential leakage of CO2 from geological reservoirs, is among the reasons why over the past decade CCS has not yet been deployed on a scale large enough so as to meaningfully contribute to mitigate climate change. Storage of CO2 under the seabed moves this climate mitigation option away from inhabited areas and could thereby take away some of the opposition towards this technology. Given that in the event of CO2 leakage through the overburden in the case of sub-seabed CCS, the ocean could function as buffer for receiving this greenhouse gas, instead of it directly being emitted into the atmosphere, offshore CCS could also address concerns over the climatic impacts of CO2 seepage. We point out that recent geological studies provide evidence that to date CO2 has been safely stored under the seabed. Leakage for individual offshore CCS operations could thus be unlikely from a technical point of view, if storage sites are well chosen, well managed and well monitored. But we argue that on a global longterm scale, for an ensemble of thousands or millions of storage sites, leakage of CO2 could take place in certain cases and/or countries for e.g. economic, institutional, legal or safety-cultural reasons. In this paper we investigate what the impact could be in terms of temperature increase and ocean acidification if leakage occurs at a global level, and address the question what the relative roles could be of on- and offshore CCS if mankind desires to divert the damages resulting from climate change. For this purpose, we constructed a top-down energy-environment-economy model, with which we performed a probabilistic Monte-Carlo cost-benefit analysis of climate change mitigation with on- and offshore CCS as specific CO2 abatement options. One of our main conclusions is that, even under conditions with non-zero (permille/year) leakage for CCS activity globally, both onshore and offshore CCS should probably â€“ on economic grounds at least - still account for anywhere between 20Â % and 80Â % of all future CO2 abatement efforts under a broad range of CCS cost assumptions.

"Development of environmental impact monitoring protocol for offshore carbon capture and storage (CCS): A biological perspective","Kim, H. and Kim, Y.H. and Kang, S.-G. and Park, Y.-G.","2016","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","Offshore geologic storage of carbon dioxide (CO2), known as offshore carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), has been under active investigation as a safe, effective mitigation option for reducing CO2 levels from anthropogenic fossil fuel burning and climate change. Along with increasing trends in implementation plans and related logistics on offshore CCS, thorough risk assessment (i.e. environmental impact monitoring) needs to be conducted to evaluate potential risks, such as CO2 gas leakage at injection sites. Gas leaks from offshore CCS may affect the physiology of marine organisms and disrupt certain ecosystem functions, thereby posing an environmental risk. Here, we synthesize current knowledge on environmental impact monitoring of offshore CCS with an emphasis on biological aspects and provide suggestions for better practice. Based on our critical review of preexisting literatures, this paper: 1) discusses key variables sensitive to or indicative of gas leakage by summarizing physico-chemical and ecological variables measured from previous monitoring cruises on offshore CCS; 2) lists ecosystem and organism responses to a similar environmental condition to CO2 leakage and associated impacts, such as ocean acidification and hypercapnia, to predict how they serve as responsive indicators of short- and long-term gas exposure, and 3) discusses the designs of the artificial gas release experiments in fields and the best model simulation to produce realistic leakage scenarios in marine ecosystems. Based on our analysis, we suggest that proper incorporation of biological aspects will provide successful and robust long-term monitoring strategies with earlier detection of gas leakage, thus reducing the risks associated with offshore CCS.

This paper reviews how three valued services have, and will continue to, shift under climate change: (1) capture fisheries, (2) food from aquaculture, and (3) protection from coastal hazards such as storms and sea-level rise. Climate adaptation planning is just beginning for fisheries, aquaculture production, and risk mitigation for coastal erosion and inundation. A few examples are highlighted, showing the promise of considering multiple ecosystem services in developing approaches to adapt to sea-level rise, ocean acidification, and rising sea temperatures. Ecosystem-based adaptation in fisheries and along coastlines and changes in aquaculture practices can improve resilience of species and habitats to future environmental challenges. Opportunities to use market incentives - such as compensation for services or nutrient trading schemes - are relatively untested in marine systems. Relocation of communities in response to rising sea levels illustrates the urgent need to manage human activities and investments in ecosystems to provide a sustainable flow of benefits in the face of future climate change.

Although it is well documented that the materials comprising artificial structures influence the composition of organisms that use them as habitat, little is known about how these materials may chemically react with changing seawater conditions, and what effects this will have on associated biota. We investigated the effects of ocean warming, acidification, and type of coastal infrastructure material on algal turfs. Seawater acidification resulted in greater covers of turf, though this effect was counteracted by elevated temperatures. Concrete supported a greater cover of turf than granite or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) under all temperature and pH treatments, with the greatest covers occurring under simulated ocean acidification. Furthermore, photosynthetic efficiency under acidification was greater on concrete substratum compared to all other materials and treatment combinations. These results demonstrate the capacity to maximise ecological benefits whilst still meeting local management objectives when engineering coastal defense structures by selecting materials that are appropriate in an ocean change context. Therefore, mitigation efforts to offset impacts from sea-level rise and storms can also be engineered to alter, or even reduce, the effects of climatic change on biological assemblages.

"Adaptation to climate change-related ocean acidification: An adaptive governance approach","Greenhill, Lucy and Kenter, Jasper O. and Dannevig, Halvor","2020","Ocean \& Coastal Management","Climate change-driven ocean acidification (OA) is causing rapid change to global ecosystems and poses a significant threat to marine life. However, predicting ecosystem effects remains highly uncertain and governance responses to OA are not yet forthcoming. Adaptive governance can provide a means to deal with this uncertainty and we consider its application to the polycentric governance of adaptation responses to OA in Scotland, focussing on the aquaculture industry as a vulnerable sector. A workshop was used to develop potential responses to OA and to gain information about present and potential capacity for adaptive governance at national and regional levels. Scottish legislation, policy and planning documents were subsequently analysed to enable description of how governance and management arrangements constrain or enable adaptation responses. Legislative and policy analysis indicates convergence across emerging mechanisms in support of adaptive governance and identified interventions. Recent advances in climate change adaptation in Scotland promotes integration of adaptation into wider Scottish Government policy development and functions, based on iterative and collaborative processes across scales. Alongside this, new models of coastal and marine governance, including a partnership-led regional marine planning process and devolution of seabed management rights under Crown Estate Scotland, seek to advance new models of locally-led and learning-based planning and management which can support adaptation responses. However, adaptation measures at operational scale requires flexibility in the aquaculture licensing regime which is currently of low adaptive capacity. Further, expansion of the industry faces social and ecological constraints which limit spatial measures, and are complicated by uncertainty in predicting local OA effects. Expanding the use of holistic and co-operative management tools such as Aquaculture Management Areas could support adaptation across wider spatial scales. Better integration across policy and planning instruments is also needed to enhance adaptive capacity, including between climate change adaptation, marine planning and aquaculture planning and management. This could be enabled by establishing links between existing and proposed collaborative groups to enhance development of adaptation responses and through co-ordination of monitoring and review processes to promote learning across scales.","Oceanography; Water Resources","2020.22","selected",""
"Observed and Projected Impacts of Climate Change on Marine Fisheries, Aquaculture, Coastal Tourism, and Human Health: An Update","Weatherdon, Lauren V. and Magnan, Alexandre K. and Rogers, Alex D. and Sumaila, U. Rashid and Cheung, William W. L.","2016","Frontiers In Marine Science","The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) states that climate change and ocean acidification are altering the oceans at a rate that is unprecedented compared with the recent past, leading to multifaceted impacts on marine ecosystems, associated goods and services, and human societies. AR5 underlined key uncertainties that remain regarding how synergistic changes in the ocean are likely to affect human systems, and how humans are likely to respond to these events. As climate change research has accelerated rapidly following AR5, an updated synthesis of available knowledge is necessary to identify emerging evidence, and to thereby better inform policy discussions. This paper reviews the literature to capture corroborating, conflicting, and novel findings published following the cut-off date for contribution to AR5. Specifically, we highlight key scientific developments on the impacts of climate-induced changes in the ocean on key socioeconomic sectors, including fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism. New evidence continues to support a climate-induced redistribution of benefits and losses at multiple scales and across coastal and marine socio-ecological systems, partly resulting from species and ecosystem range shifts and changes in primary productivity. New efforts have been made to characterize and value ecosystem services in the context of climate change, with specific relevance to ecosystem-based adaptation. Recent studies have also explored synergistic interactions between climatic drivers, and have found strong variability between impacts on species at different life stages. Although climate change may improve conditions for some types of freshwater aquaculture, potentially providing alternative opportunities to adapt to impacts on wild capture fisheries, ocean acidification poses a risk to shellfish fisheries and aquaculture. The risk of increased prevalence of disease under warmer temperatures is uncertain, and may detrimentally affect human health. Climate change may also induce changes in tourism flows, leading to substantial geospatial shifts in economic costs and benefits associated with tourism revenue and coastal infrastructure protection and repairs. While promising, ecosystem based coastal adaptation approaches are still emerging, and require an improved understanding of key ecosystem services, and values for coastal and build decision communities in order to assess risk, aid coastal development planning, support systems.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2016.542",NA,""

Use of biological organism complexes such as algae and oysters to sequester carbon can provide a sustainable solar based solution for carbon capture and storage (CCS) to mitigate the risks of climate change. On a carbon per time per surface area basis, these reefs can be orders of magnitude more effective than grass based systems and significantly more effective than some tree based systems.

"A review of interventions proposed to abate impacts of ocean acidification on coral reefs","Albright, Rebecca and Cooley, Sarah","2019","Regional Studies In Marine Science","Coral reefs experiencing ocean acidification (OA) are likely to recover much more slowly from damage caused by acute events such as mass bleaching because OA slows coral reef growth and reproduction. To maintain reefs in a net growth or net-neutral condition, curbing the impact of OA is therefore necessary. A variety of mitigation and adaptation strategies have been proposed to abate OA impacts on reefs. However, detailed guidance for managers on the types, effectiveness, or costs of different local interventions to address OA is scarce. To advance the discussion about available interventions, this review explores and compares mitigation and adaptation techniques that have been proposed to abate OA impacts on coral reefs. We focus primarily on four categories of interventions intended to address different ecosystem service changes: phytoremediation, chemical remediation, reef restoration, and assisted evolution. We briefly touch on traditional restoration methods like marine protected areas (MPAs) and reducing secondary sources of stress. Of the techniques reviewed, most are costly and do not scale at the same pace as global reef loss. Nor do they address the root cause of OA, global carbon emissions. That said, intervention should not be an all or nothing approach; some techniques may be worth implementing at smaller scales in a coordinated way. Working to save pieces of ecosystems and buying time may help ensure that there is more to rebuild from in the future. Despite the seemingly high price tag of many of these techniques, given the potential value of regained ecosystem services, net gains may exceed implementation costs. It is certain, however, from the limited reach of coral reef interventions, that they must be undertaken as part of a suite of global-scale interventions including atmospheric CO2 reduction to preserve coral reef ecosystem function and benefits to humanity.

A natural adaptation response is to engineer the coast in a perilous and often doomed attempt to preserve the status quo. In the long term, however, most coastal nations will need to transition to approaches based on ecological resilience-that is, to coastal zone management that allows coastal communities to absorb and adapt to change rather than to resist it-and the law will be critical in facilitating this transition. Researchers are increasingly illuminating law's ability to promote social-ecological resilience to a changing world, but this scholarship-mostly focused on U.S. law-has not yet embraced its potential role in helping to create new international norms for social-ecological resilience. Through its comparison of coastal zone management in Australia, Finland, and the Netherlands, this article demonstrates that a comparative law approach offers a fruitful expansion of law-and-resilience research, both by extending this research to other countries and, more importantly, by allowing scholars to identify critical variables, or variable constellations associated with countries' decisions to adopt laws designed to promote social-ecological resilience and to identify mechanisms that allow for a smoother transition to this approach. For example, our comparison demonstrates, among other things, that countries can adopt coastal zone management techniques that integrate social-ecological resilience without fully abandoning more traditional engineering approaches to adapt to environmental change and its impacts.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2019.607",NA,""

In particular, we investigate the assumption that fighting acidification is mainly, but not only, about reducing CO2 emissions, and explore the leeway that this emerging problem may open in old environmental issues. We review nine types of management responses, initially grouped under four categories: preventing ocean acidification; strengthening ecosystem resilience; adapting human activities; and repairing damages. Connecting and comparing options leads to classifying them, in a qualitative way, according to their potential and feasibility. While reducing CO2 emissions is confirmed as the key action that must be taken against acidification, some of the other options appear to have the potential to buy time, e.g. by relieving the pressure of other stressors, and help marine life face unavoidable acidification. Although the existing legal basis to take action shows few gaps, policy challenges are significant: tackling them will mean succeeding in various areas of environmental management where we failed to a large extent so far.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2013.10152","selected",""

These pressures add to, and interact with, global challenges such as ocean acidification and warming. This study investigates the combined pressures of climate change and the planned co-location of offshore wind farm (OWF) and aquaculture zones on the carbon flow through epifaunal communities inhabiting wind turbines in the North Sea. A 13C-labelled phytoplankton pulse-chase experiment was performed in mesocosms (4 m3) holding undisturbed hard-substrate (HS) communities, natural sediment with infauna, and mobile invertebrate predators. Carbon assimilation was quantified under current and predicted future-climate conditions (+3 Â°C and âˆ’0.3 pH units), as well as a future-climate co-use scenario with blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) aquaculture. Climate change induced an increase in macrofaunal carbon assimilation as well as an organic enrichment of underlying sediments. Dynamic (non-)trophic links between M. edulis and other HS epifauna resulted in shifts among the species contributing most to the phytoplankton-derived carbon flow across climate scenarios. Increased inter- and intraspecific resource competition in the presence of M. edulis aquaculture prevented a large increase in the total assimilation of phytoplankton by HS fauna. Lower individual carbon assimilation rates by both mussels and other epifauna suggest that if filter capacity by HS epifauna would approach renewal by advection/mixing, M. edulis individuals would likely grow to a smaller-than-desired commercial size. In the same scenario, benthic organic carbon mineralisation was significantly boosted due to increased organic matter deposition by the aquaculture set-up. Combining these results with in situ OWF abundance data confirmed M. edulis as the most impactful OWF AHS species in terms of (total) carbon assimilation as well as the described stress responses due to climate change and the addition of bivalve aquaculture.
