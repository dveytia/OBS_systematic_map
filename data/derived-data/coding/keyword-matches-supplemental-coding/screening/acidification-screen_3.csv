Physiological energetics of juvenile clams Ruditapes decussatus in a high CO2 coastal ocean,"Jose Fernandez-Reiriz, Ma and Range, Pedro and Anton Alvarez-Salgado, Xose and Labarta, Uxio",2011,Marine Ecology Progress Series,"Effects of coastal ocean acidification, other than calcification, were tested on juvenile clams Ruditapes decussatus during a controlled CO2 perturbation experiment. The carbonate chemistry of natural (control) seawater was manipulated by injecting CO2 to attain 2 reduced pH levels (-0.4 and -0.7 pH units) as compared with the control seawater. After 87 d of exposure, we found that the acidification conditions tested in this experiment significantly reduced the clearance, ingestion and respiration rates, and increased the ammonia excretion rate of R. decussatus seeds. Reduced ingestion combined with increased excretion is generally associated with a reduced energy input, which will likely contribute to a slower growth of the clams in a future high CO2 coastal ocean. These results emphasize the need for management policies to mitigate the adverse effects of global change on aquaculture, which is an economically relevant activity in most coastal areas worldwide.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,2011.335,excluded,
MARINE PHOTOSYNTHETIC RESPONSE TO INCREASED ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION AND OCEANIC ACIDIFICATION,"Wu, Hongyan and Zou, Dinghui and Gao, Kunshan",2009,NANA,"Increasing atmospheric CO2 and subsequent rise of pCO(2) in seawater alters the carbonate system and related chemical reactions in surface ocean, reducing pH and the concentration of carbonate (CO32-) while increasing that of bicarbonate (HCO3-). Such changes in marine chemistry, with inore and more CO2 accumulated in the atmosphere, will be accelerated and affect photosynthetic CO2 Fixation processes of phytoplanktonic and macroalgal species in direct and/or indirect ways. Although many unicellular and multicellular species are known to operate CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) to utilize the large HCO3- pool in seawater, enriched CO2 up to several times the present atmospheric level has been shown to enhance photosynthesis and growth of both phytoplanktonic and macroalgal species that have less capacity of CCMs. Even for the species that operate active CCMs and those whose photosynthesis is not limited by pCO(2) in seawater, increased CO2 levels can down-regulate their CCMs and therefore enhance their growth under light-limiting conditions (at higher CO2 level, less light energy is required to drive CCM). Altered physiological performances under high-CO2 conditions may cause genetic alteration in view of adaptation over long time scale. Marine photosynthetic organisms may adapt to a high CO2 oceanic environment so that the evolved communities in future are likely to be genetically different from the contemporary communities. However, most of the previous studies have been carried out without considering the acidifying effects of increased CO2 and other interactive factors. Nevertheless, the advances reported so far are important for us to explore how physiology of marine primary producers performs in a high-CO2 and low-pH oceans.",Plant Sciences,2009.1414,excluded,
Productivity gains do not compensate for reduced calcification under near-future ocean acidification in the photosynthetic benthic foraminifer species Marginopora vertebralis,"Uthicke, Sven and Fabricius, Katharina E.",2012,Global Change Biology,"Changes in the seawater carbonate chemistry (ocean acidification) from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations negatively affect many marine calcifying organisms, but may benefit primary producers under dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) limitation. To improve predictions of the ecological effects of ocean acidification, the net gains and losses between the processes of photosynthesis and calcification need to be studied jointly on physiological and population levels. We studied productivity, respiration, and abundances of the symbiont-bearing foraminifer species Marginopora vertebralis on natural CO2 seeps in Papua New Guinea and conducted additional studies on production and calcification on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) using artificially enhanced pCO2. Net oxygen production increased up to 90\% with increasing pCO2; temperature, light, and pH together explaining 61\% of the variance in production. Production increased with increasing light and increasing pCO2 and declined at higher temperatures. Respiration was also significantly elevated (similar to 25\%), whereas calcification was reduced (1639\%) at low pH/high pCO2 compared to present-day conditions. In the field, M. vertebralis was absent at three CO2 seep sites at pHTotal levels below similar to 7.9 (pCO2 similar to 700 similar to mu atm), but it was found in densities of over 1000 similar to m-2 at all three control sites. The study showed that endosymbiotic algae in foraminifera benefit from increased DIC availability and may be naturally carbon limited. The observed reduction in calcification may have been caused either by increased energy demands for proton pumping (measured as elevated rates of respiration) or by stronger competition for DIC from the more productive symbionts. The net outcome of these two competing processes is that M. vertebralis cannot maintain populations under pCO2 exceeding 700 similar to mu atm, thus are likely to be extinct in the next century.",Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology,2012.1515,NA,
Physiological responses of coccolithophores to abrupt exposure of naturally low pH deep seawater,"Iglesias-Rodriguez, M.D. and Jones, B.M. and Blanco-Ameijeiras, S. and Greaves, M. and Huete-Ortega, M. and Lebrato, M.",2017,Plos One,"Upwelling is the process by which deep, cold, relatively high-CO2, nutrient-rich seawater rises to the sunlit surface of the ocean. This seasonal process has fueled geoengineering initiatives to fertilize the surface ocean with deep seawater to enhance productivity and thus promote the drawdown of CO2. Coccolithophores, which inhabit many upwelling regions naturally â€˜fertilizedâ€™ by deep seawater, have been investigated in the laboratory in the context of ocean acidification to determine the extent to which nutrients and CO2 impact their physiology, but few data exist in the field except from mesocosms. Here, we used the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (north Atlantic Ocean) Observatory to retrieve seawater from depths with elevated CO2 and nutrients, mimicking geoengineering approaches. We tested the effects of abrupt natural deep seawater fertilization on the physiology and biogeochemistry of two strains of Emiliania huxleyi of known physiology. None of the strains tested underwent cell divisions when incubated in waters obtained from &lt;1,000 m (pH = 7.99â€“8.08; CO2 = 373â€“485 p.p.m; 1.5â€“12 Î¼M nitrate). However, growth was promoted in both strains when cells were incubated in seawater from ~1,000 m (pH = 7.9; CO2 ~560 p.p.m.; 14â€“17 Î¼M nitrate) and ~4,800 m (pH = 7.9; CO2 ~600 p.p.m.; 21 Î¼M nitrate). Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP 88E showed no differences in growth rate or in cellular content or production rates of particulate organic (POC) and inorganic (PIC) carbon and cellular particulate organic nitrogen (PON) between treatments using water from 1,000 m and 4,800 m. However, despite the N: P ratio of seawater being comparable in water from ~1,000 and ~4,800 m, the PON production rates were three times lower in one incubation using water from ~1,000 m compared to values observed in water from ~4,800 m. Thus, the POC:PON ratios were threefold higher in cells that were incubated in ~1,000 m seawater. The heavily calcified strain NZEH exhibited lower growth rates and PIC production rates when incubated in water from ~4,800 m compared to ~1,000 m, while cellular PIC, POC and PON were higher in water from 4,800 m. Calcite Sr/Ca ratios increased with depth despite constant seawater Sr/Ca, indicating that upwelling changes coccolith geochemistry. Our study provides the first experimental and field trial of a geoengineering approach to test how deep seawater impacts coccolithophore physiological and biogeochemical properties. Given that coccolithophore growth was only stimulated using waters obtained from &gt;1,000 m, artificial upwelling using shallower waters may not be a suitable approach for promoting carbon sequestration for some locations and assemblages, and should therefore be investigated on a site-by-site basis.

Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa) resilience to natural pH variation,"Spencer, Laura H. and Horwith, Micah and Lowe, Alexander T. and Venkataraman, Yaamini R. and Timmins-Schiffman, Emma and Nunn, Brook L. and Roberts, Steven B.",2019,Comparative Biochemistry And Physiology D-genomics \& Proteomics,"Pacific geoduck aquaculture is a growing industry, however, little is known about how geoduck respond to varying environmental conditions, or how the industry will fare under projected climate conditions. To understand how geoduck production may be impacted by low pH associated with ocean acidification, multi-faceted environmental heterogeneity needs to be included to understand species and community responses. In this study, eelgrass habitats and environmental heterogeneity across four estuarine bays were leveraged to examine low pH effects on geoduck under different natural regimes, using targeted proteomics to assess physiology. Juvenile geoduck were deployed in eelgrass and adjacent unvegetated habitats for 30 days while pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity were monitored. Across the four bays, pH was lower in unvegetated habitats compared to eelgrass habitats. However this did not impact geoduck growth, survival, or proteomic abundance patterns in gill tissue. Temperature and dissolved oxygen differences across all locations corresponded to differences in growth and targeted protein abundance patterns. Specifically, three protein abundance levels (trifunctional-enzyme beta-subunit, puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase, and heat shock protein 90-alpha) and shell growth positively correlated with dissolved oxygen variability and inversely correlated with mean temperature. These results demonstrate that geoduck may be resilient to low pH in a natural setting, but other abiotic factors (i.e. temperature, dissolved oxygen variability) may have a greater influence on geoduck physiology. In addition this study contributes to the understanding of how eelgrass patches influences water chemistry.",Biochemistry \& Molecular Biology; Genetics \& Heredity,2019.8664,NA,
Energetic context determines species and community responses to ocean acidification,"Brown, Norah E. M. and Bernhardt, Joey R. and Harley, Christopher D. G.",2020,Ecology,"Physiological responses to ocean acidification are thought to be related to energetic trade-offs. Although a number of studies have proposed that negative responses to low pH could be minimized in situations where food resources are more readily available, evidence for such effects on individuals remain mixed, and the consequences of such effects at the community level remain untested. We explored the potential for food availability and diet quality to modify the effects of acidification on developing marine fouling communities in field-deployed mesocosms by supplementing natural food supply with one of two species of phytoplankton, differing in concentration of fatty acids. After 12 weeks, no species demonstrated the interactive effects generally predicted in the literature, where a positive overall effect of diet mitigated the negative overall effects of acidification. Rather, for some species, additional food supply appeared to bring out or exacerbate the negative effects of low pH. Community richness and structure were only altered by acidification, while space occupation and evenness reflected patterns of the most dominant species. Importantly, we find that acidification stress can increase the relative abundance of invasive species, even under resource conditions that otherwise prevented invasive species establishment. Overall, the proposed hypothesis regarding the ability for food addition to mitigate the negative effects of acidification is thus far not widely supported at species or community levels. It is clear that acidification is a strong driving force in these communities but understanding underlying energetic and competitive context is essential to developing mechanistic predictions for climate change responses.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology,2020.4477,NA,
Ocean acidification of the Greater Caribbean Region 1996-2006,"Gledhill, D.K. and Wanninkhof, R. and Millero, F.J. and Eakin, M.",2008,Journal Of Geophysical Research: Oceans,"The global oceans serve as the largest sustained natural sink for increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. As this CO2 is absorbed by seawater, it not only reacts causing a reduction in seawater pH (or acidification) but also decreases the carbonate mineral saturation state (Î©), which plays an important role in calcification for many marine organisms. Ocean acidification could affect some of the most fundamental biological and geochemical processes of the sea in coming decades. Observations obtained in situ from Volunteer Observing Ships and multiple geochemical surveys have been extended using satellite remote sensing and modeled environmental parameters to derive estimates of sea-surface alkalinity (AT) and carbon dioxide partial pressure (PCO2,sw). Pairing estimates of AT and PCO2,sw have permitted characterization of the changes in sea-surface Î©, which have transpired over the past decade throughout the Greater Caribbean Region as a consequence of ocean acidification. The results reveal considerable spatial and temporal variability throughout the region. Despite this variability, we observed a strong secular decrease in aragonite saturation state (Î© arg) at a rate of approximately -0.012 Â± 0.001 Î©arg yr-1 (r2=0.97, P&lt;0.001).

Food Supply and Seawater pCO(2) Impact Calcification and Internal Shell Dissolution in the Blue Mussel Mytilus edulis,"Melzner, Frank and Stange, Paul and Truebenbach, Katja and Thomsen, Joern and Casties, Isabel and Panknin, Ulrike and Gorb, Stanislav N. and Gutowska, Magdalena A.",2011,Plos One,"Progressive ocean acidification due to anthropogenic CO2 emissions will alter marine ecosytem processes. Calcifying organisms might be particularly vulnerable to these alterations in the speciation of the marine carbonate system. While previous research efforts have mainly focused on external dissolution of shells in seawater under saturated with respect to calcium carbonate, the internal shell interface might be more vulnerable to acidification. In the case of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, high body fluid pCO(2) causes low pH and low carbonate concentrations in the extrapallial fluid, which is in direct contact with the inner shell surface. In order to test whether elevated seawater pCO(2) impacts calcification and inner shell surface integrity we exposed Baltic M. edulis to four different seawater pCO(2) (39, 142, 240, 405 Pa) and two food algae (310-350 cells mL(-1) vs. 1600-2000 cells mL(-1)) concentrations for a period of seven weeks during winter (5 degrees C). We found that low food algae concentrations and high pCO(2) values each significantly decreased shell length growth. Internal shell surface corrosion of nacreous (= aragonite) layers was documented via stereomicroscopy and SEM at the two highest pCO(2) treatments in the high food group, while it was found in all treatments in the low food group. Both factors, food and pCO(2), significantly influenced the magnitude of inner shell surface dissolution. Our findings illustrate for the first time that integrity of inner shell surfaces is tightly coupled to the animals' energy budget under conditions of CO2 stress. It is likely that under food limited conditions, energy is allocated to more vital processes (e. g. somatic mass maintenance) instead of shell conservation. It is evident from our results that mussels exert significant biological control over the structural integrity of their inner shell surfaces.",Science \& Technology - Other Topics,2011.4087,NA,
Global trends of ocean CO2 sink and ocean acidification: an observation-based reconstruction of surface ocean inorganic carbon variables,"Iida, Y. and Takatani, Y. and Kojima, A. and Ishii, M.",2021,Journal Of Oceanography,"Ocean acidification is likely to impact marine ecosystems and human societies adversely and is a carbon cycle issue of great concern. Projecting the degree of ocean acidification and the carbon-climate feedback will require understanding the current status, variability, and trends of ocean inorganic carbon system variables and the ocean carbon sink. With this goal in mind, we reconstructed total alkalinity (TA), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2 partial pressure (pCO2sea), seaâ€“air CO2 flux, pH, and aragonite saturation state (Î©arg) for the global ocean based on measurements of pCO2sea and TA. We used a multiple linear regression approach to derive relationships to explain TA and DIC and obtained monthly 1Â° Ã— 1Â° gridded values of TA and DIC for the period 1993â€“2018. These data were converted to pCO2sea, pH, and Î©arg, and monthly sea-air CO2 fluxes were obtained in combination with atmospheric CO2. Mean annual seaâ€“air CO2 flux and its rate of change were estimated to be âˆ’ 2.0 Â± 0.5 PgC yearâˆ’1 and âˆ’ 0.3 (PgC yearâˆ’1) decadeâˆ’1, respectively. Our analysis revealed that oceanic CO2 uptake decreased during the 1990s and has been increasing since 2000. Our estimate of the globally averaged rate of pH change, âˆ’ 0.0181 Â± 0.0001 decadeâˆ’1, was consistent with that expected from the trend of atmospheric CO2 growth. However, rates of decline of pH were relatively slow in the Southern Ocean (âˆ’ 0.0165 Â± 0.0001Â·decadeâˆ’1) and in the western equatorial Pacific (âˆ’ 0.0148 Â± 0.0002Â·decadeâˆ’1).

Heterotrophy of Oceanic Particulate Organic Matter Elevates Net Ecosystem Calcification,"Kealoha, Andrea K. and Shamberger, Kathryn E. F. and Reid, Emma C. and Davis, Kristen A. and Lentz, Steven J. and Brainard, Russell E. and Oliver, Thomas A. and Rappe, Michael S. and Roark, E. Brendan and Rii, Yoshimi M.",2019,Geophysical Research Letters,"Coral reef calcification is expected to decline due to climate change stressors such as ocean acidification and warming. Projections of future coral reef health are based on our understanding of the environmental drivers that affect calcification and dissolution. One such driver that may impact coral reef health is heterotrophy of oceanic-sourced particulate organic matter, but its link to calcification has not been directly investigated in the field. In this study, we estimated net ecosystem calcification and oceanic particulate organic carbon (POCoc) uptake across the Kane'ohe Bay barrier reef in Hawaii. We show that higher rates of POCoc uptake correspond to greater net ecosystem calcification rates, even under low aragonite saturation states (Omega(ar)). Hence, reductions in offshore productivity may negatively impact coral reefs by decreasing the food supply required to sustain calcification. Alternatively, coral reefs that receive ample inputs of POCoc may maintain higher calcification rates, despite a global decline in Omega(ar). Plain Language Summary Coral reefs are threatened by climate change stressors including ocean acidification and ocean warming. One way to measure and monitor coral reef health is to estimate coral reef calcification, which is influenced by several environmental factors including light, temperature, pH, and nutrient availability. By understanding the effects of these factors on calcification, we can better predict how corals will respond to climate change. One potentially important factor for calcification that has not been investigated in the field is coral reef ecosystem feeding on particulate organic matter supplied from offshore (i.e., oceanic particulate organic matter). In this study, we estimated net ecosystem calcification and oceanic particulate organic carbon (POC) uptake across the Kane'ohe Bay barrier reef in Hawaii. For the first time, we show a direct correlation between net ecosystem calcification and oceanic POC uptake, which suggests that the reef is using oceanic POC as an energy source to elevate calcification. However, since climate change reduces oceanic POC production through warming and stratification, our results imply coral reef calcification may decline. Alternatively, coral reefs located in regions of high oceanic productivity and that sustain greater rates of oceanic POC uptake may be able to maintain calcification longer into the future.",Geology,2019.1667,excluded,
CO2-induced seawater acidification affects physiological performance of the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum,"Wu, Y. and Gao, K. and Riebesell, U.",2010,Biogeosciences,"CO2/pH perturbation experiments were carried out under two different pCO(2) levels (39.3 and 101.3 Pa) to evaluate effects of CO2-induced ocean acidification on the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. After acclimation (>20 generations) to ambient and elevated CO2 conditions (with corresponding pH values of 8.15 and 7.80, respectively), growth and photosynthetic carbon fixation rates of high CO2 grown cells were enhanced by 5\% and 12\%, respectively, and dark respiration stimulated by 34\% compared to cells grown at ambient CO2. The half saturation constant (K-m) for carbon fixation (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC) increased by 20\% under the low pH and high CO2 condition, reflecting a decreased affinity for HCO3- or/and CO2 and down-regulated carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM). In the high CO2 grown cells, the electron transport rate from photosystem II (PSII) was photoinhibited to a greater extent at high levels of photosynthetically active radiation, while non-photochemical quenching was reduced compared to low CO2 grown cells. This was probably due to the down-regulation of CCM, which serves as a sink for excessive energy. The balance between these positive and negative effects on diatom productivity will be a key factor in determining the net effect of rising atmospheric CO2 on ocean primary production.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Geology,2010.1261,NA,
Coral reefs modify their seawater carbon chemistry - implications for impacts of ocean acidification,"Anthony, Kenneth R. N. and Kleypas, Joan A. and Gattuso, Jean-Pierre",2011,Global Change Biology,"Reviews suggest that that the biogeochemical threshold for sustained coral reef growth will be reached during this century due to ocean acidification caused by increased uptake of atmospheric CO2. Projections of ocean acidification, however, are based on air-sea fluxes in the open ocean, and not for shallow-water systems such as coral reefs. Like the open ocean, reef waters are subject to the chemical forcing of increasing atmospheric pCO(2). However, for reefs with long water residence times, we illustrate that benthic carbon fluxes can drive spatial variation in pH, pCO(2) and aragonite saturation state (Omega(a)) that can mask the effects of ocean acidification in some downstream habitats. We use a carbon flux model for photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and dissolution coupled with Lagrangian transport to examine how key groups of calcifiers (zooxanthellate corals) and primary producers (macroalgae) on coral reefs contribute to changes in the seawater carbonate system as a function of water residence time. Analyses based on flume data showed that the carbon fluxes of corals and macroalgae drive Omega(a) in opposing directions. Areas dominated by corals elevate pCO(2) and reduce Omega(a), thereby compounding ocean acidification effects in downstream habitats, whereas algal beds draw CO2 down and elevate Omega(a), potentially offsetting ocean acidification impacts at the local scale. Simulations for two CO2 scenarios (600 and 900 ppm CO2) suggested that a potential shift from coral to algal abundance under ocean acidification can lead to improved conditions for calcification in downstream habitats, depending on reef size, water residence time and circulation patterns. Although the carbon fluxes of benthic reef communities cannot significantly counter changes in carbon chemistry at the scale of oceans, they provide a significant mechanism of buffering ocean acidification impacts at the scale of habitat to reef.",Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology,2011.1522,NA,
Ocean acidification as a driver of community simplification via the collapse of higher-order and rise of lower-order consumers,"Vizzini, S. and Martinez-Crego, B. and Andolina, C. and Massa-Gallucci, A. and Connell, S. D. and Gambi, M. C.",2017,Scientific Reports,"Increasing oceanic uptake of CO2 is predicted to drive ecological change as both a resource (i.e. CO2 enrichment on primary producers) and stressor (i.e. lower pH on consumers). We use the natural ecological complexity of a CO(2)vent (i.e. a seagrass system) to assess the potential validity of conceptual models developed from laboratory and mesocosm research. Our observations suggest that the stressor-effect of CO2 enrichment combined with its resource-effect drives simplified food web structure of lower trophic diversity and shorter length. The transfer of CO2 enrichment from plants to herbivores through consumption (apparent resource-effect) was not compensated by predation, because carnivores failed to contain herbivore outbreaks. Instead, these higher-order consumers collapsed (apparent stressor-effect on carnivores) suggesting limited trophic propagation to predator populations. The dominance of primary producers and their lower-order consumers along with the loss of carnivores reflects the duality of intensifying ocean acidification acting both as resource-effect (i.e. bottom-up control) and stressor-effect (i.e. top-down control) to simplify community and trophic structure and function. This shifting balance between the propagation of resource enrichment and its consumption across trophic levels provides new insights into how the trophic dynamics might stabilize against or propagate future environmental change.",Science \& Technology - Other Topics,2017.2168,NA,
An in situ assessment of local adaptation in a calcifying polychaete froma shallow CO2 vent system,"Lucey, Noelle M. and Lombardi, Chiara and Florio, Maurizio and DeMarchi, Lucia and Nannini, Matteo and Rundle, Simon and Gambi, Maria Cristina and Calosi, Piero",2016,Evolutionary Applications,"Ocean acidification (OA) is likely to exert selective pressure on natural populations. Our ability to predict which marine species will adapt to OA and what underlies this adaptive potential is of high conservation and resource management priority. Using a naturally low-pH vent site in the Mediterranean Sea (Castello Aragonese, Ischia) mirroring projected future OA conditions, we carried out a reciprocal transplant experiment to investigate the relative importance of phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation in two populations of the sessile, calcifying polychaete Simplaria sp. (Annelida, Serpulidae, Spirorbinae): one residing in low pH and the other from a nearby ambient (i.e. high) pH site. We measured a suite of fitness-related traits (i.e. survival, reproductive output, maturation, population growth) and tube growth rates in laboratory-bred F2 generation individuals from both populations reciprocally transplanted back into both ambient and low-pH in situ habitats. Both populations showed lower expression in all traits, but increased tube growth rates, when exposed to low-pH compared with high-pH conditions, regardless of their site of origin suggesting that local adaptation to low-pH conditions has not occurred. We also found comparable levels of plasticity in the two populations investigated, suggesting no influence of long-term exposure to low pH on the ability of populations to adjust their phenotype. Despite high variation in trait values among sites and the relatively extreme conditions at the low pH site (pH < 7.36), response trends were consistent across traits. Hence, our data suggest that, for Simplaria and possibly other calcifiers, neither local adaptations nor sufficient phenotypic plasticity levels appear to suffice in order to compensate for the negative impacts of OA on long-term survival. Our work also emphasizes the utility of field experiments in natural environments subjected to high level of pCO(2) for elucidating the potential for adaptation to future scenarios of OA.",Evolutionary Biology,2016.5656,excluded,
Short-Term Spatial and Temporal Carbonate Chemistry Variability in Two Contrasting Seagrass Meadows: Implications for pH Buffering Capacities,"Cyronak, Tyler and Andersson, Andreas J. and D'Angelo, Sydney and Bresnahan, Philip and Davidson, Charles and Griffin, Alyssa and Kindeberg, Theodor and Pennise, Jimmy and Takeshita, Yuichiro and White, Margot",2018,Estuaries And Coasts,"It has been hypothesized that highly productive coastal ecosystems, such as seagrass meadows, could lead to the establishment of ocean acidification (OA) refugia, or areas of elevated pH and aragonite saturation state (Omega(a)) compared to source seawater. However, seagrass ecosystems experience extreme variability in carbonate chemistry across short temporal and small spatial scales, which could impact the pH buffering capacity of these potential refugia. Herein, short-term (hourly to diel) and small-scale (across 0.01-0.14 km(2)) spatiotemporal carbonate chemistry variability was assessed within two seagrass meadows in order to determine their short-term potential to elevate seawater pH relative to source seawater. Two locations at similar latitudes were chosen in order to compare systems dominated by coarse calcium carbonate (Bailey's Bay, Bermuda) and muddy silicate (Mission Bay, CA, USA) sediments. In both systems, spatial variability of pH across the seagrass meadow at any given time was often greater than diel variability (e.g., the average range over 24 h) at any one site, with greater spatial variability occurring at low tide in Mission Bay. Mission Bay (spatial Delta pH = 0.08 +/- 0.08; diel Delta pH = 0.12 +/- 0.01; mean +/- SD) had a greater average range in both temporal and spatial seawater chemistry than Bailey's Bay (spatial Delta pH = 0.02 +/- 0.01; diel Delta pH = 0.03 +/- 0.00; mean +/- SD). These differences were most likely due to a combination of slower currents, a larger tidal range, and more favorable weather conditions for photosynthesis (e.g., sunny with no rain) in Mission Bay. In both systems, there was a substantial amount of time (usually at night) when seawater pH within the seagrass beds was lower relative to the source seawater. Future studies aimed at assessing the potential of seagrass ecosystems to act as OA refugia for marine organisms need to account for the small-scale, high-frequency carbonate chemistry variability in both space and time, as this variability will impact where and when OA will be buffered or intensified.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology,2018.3903,selected,
Changes in anthropogenic carbon storage in the Northeast Pacific in the last decade,"Chu, Sophie N. and Wang, Zhaohui Aleck and Doney, Scott C. and Lawson, Gareth L. and Hoering, Katherine A.",2016,Journal Of Geophysical Research-oceans,"In order to understand the ocean's role as a sink for anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), it is important to quantify changes in the amount of anthropogenic CO2 stored in the ocean interior over time. From August to September 2012, an ocean acidification cruise was conducted along a portion of the P17N transect (50 degrees N 150 degrees W to 33.5 degrees N 135 degrees W) in the Northeast Pacific. These measurements are compared with data from the previous occupation of this transect in 2001 to estimate the change in the anthropogenic CO2 inventory in the Northeast Pacific using an extended multiple linear regression (eMLR) approach. Maximum increases in the surface waters were 11 mu mol kg(-1) over 11 years near 50 degrees N. Here, the penetration depth of anthropogenic CO2 only reached approximate to 300 m depth, whereas at 33.5 degrees N, penetration depth reached approximate to 600 m.

A fishy tale - a missing part of the inorganic ocean carbon cycle,"Wilson, R.W. and Reardon, E.E. and Perry, C.T.",2011,Biochemist,"Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, are playing an important role in the rising levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere1. The oceans may store a large portion of CO2 that we are releasing into the atmosphere, with up to 40% already taken up by the oceans. Although this absorption helps to offset some of the greenhouse effect of atmospheric CO2, it also contributes to ocean acidification, or a fall in the pH of sea water. The historical global mean pH of oceanic sea water is about 8.2, and this has already declined by 0.1 pH units (a 30% increase in H+ concentration) and is predicted to reach pH ~7.7 by the end of the century if current rates of fossil fuel use continue, leading to an atmospheric CO2 level of 800 p.p.m.1,2. Even this extreme potential fall in pH would still leave seawater above the neutral point (pH 7.0), so technically it is more accurate to say that the ocean is becoming less alkaline, rather than truly acidic (i.e. below pH 7.0). However, the magnitude is perhaps less important than the speed of pH change which is occurring faster than at any time during the previous 20 million years. Over this time, the average ocean pH has probably never fallen below pH 8.0 2,3. It is only during the last decade that the importance of ocean acidification has come to the forefront of concerns for scientists1, 2. Consequences of these changes in global CO2 production are predicted to include elevated global temperatures, rising sea levels, more unpredictable and extreme weather patterns, and shifts in ecosystems1. In order to more fully understand the implications of ocean acidification, teams of researchers, including fisheries scientists, physiologists, geologists, oceanographers, chemists and climate modellers, are working to refine current understanding of the ocean carbon cycle.

EFFECTS OF CO2 DRIVEN OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ON ONTOGENETIC STAGES OF THE CUTTLEFISH SEPIA OFFICINALIS,"Hu, Marian Y.",2016,Vie Et Milieu-life And Environment,"Ocean acidification due to anthropogenic emissions of CO2 is the new kid on the block of climate change research and has received considerable attention as changes in seawater acidity and carbonate chemistry can severely affect marine organisms from the species to the ecosystem level. The degree of sensitivity within a species can vary greatly along ontogeny, often leading to highest sensitivities in early life stages. Recent studies using the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, demonstrated that it's oviparous developmental mode can constitute an additional challenge for early life stages as increases in environmental pCO(2) add on top to the already high CO2 concentration inside the egg. The micro-environment inside the egg is characterized by low pH, hypoxia, hypercapnia and high ammonia concentrations as a result of the animal's metabolism and the limited diffusion permeability of the egg capsule. This oviparous developmental mode in combination with lower pH regulatory capacities are probably the major reasons why S. officinalis embryos respond more sensitively towards seawater acidification compared to adults. Although stronger hypercapnia levels (>0.3 kPa; < pH 7.5) could demonstrate potentially negative effects on the development, metabolism and calcification, acidification levels as predicted for the coming century will probably not severely affect S. officinalis. This relative tolerance may be a consequence of a lifestyle in benthic coastal habitats, pre-adapting S. officinalis to natural fluctuations in environmental pCO(2).",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology,2016.307,NA,
Ocean acidification and dynamic energy budget models: Parameterisation and simulations for the green-lipped mussel,"Ren, J.S. and Ragg, N.L.C. and Cummings, V.J. and Zhang, J.",2020,Ecological Modelling,"Ocean acidification (OA), the change in ocean chemistry caused by carbon dioxide emissions, poses a serious imminent threat to marine organisms, especially those with calcium carbonate shells. The green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus), endemic to New Zealand, is common in coastal ecosystems and is an economically important aquaculture species. As a step towards supporting aquaculture management in a changing environment, we used a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model to investigate the potential influence of OA on growth and reproduction of the mussel. Zero-variate and growth data from local mussel farms were used to parameterise the model with the AmP method. The parameter estimation showed an acceptable goodness of fit, with a low mean relative error of 0.143 and the symmetric mean squared error of 0.125. The model was subsequently modified to estimate parameter values under OA conditions, based on data obtained from laboratory experiments where mussels were grown at future projected reduced pH (elevated pCO2) levels. The maintenance ([á¹—M]) and volume-specific cost for growth ([EG]) were identified as the key parameters in response to OA. The model was then applied to simulate mussel energetics under pCO2 scenarios projected for 2050 and 2100. The model predicts that decreasing pH would cause reductions in shell length growth, flesh weight and reproductive capacity. As well as providing a quantitative tool for understanding the influence of OA on mussel physiology, this DEB model is also an important component of individual-based population and ecosystem models, enabling simulation of complex population and ecosystem level responses to OA.

Coral Calcification Under Ocean Acidification and Global Change,"Erez, Jonathan and Reynaud, Stephanie and Silverman, Jacob and Schneider, Kenneth and Allemand, Denis",2011,NANA,"Coral reefs are unique marine ecosystems that form huge morphological structures (frameworks) in today's oceans. These include coral islands (atolls), barrier reefs, and fringing reefs that form the most impressive products of CaCO3 biomineralization. The framework builders are mainly hermatypic corals, calcareous algae, foraminifera, and mollusks that together are responsible for almost 50\% of the net annual CaCO3 precipitation in the oceans. The reef ecosystem acts as a huge filtration system that extracts plankton from the vast fluxes of ocean water that flow through the framework. The existence of these wave resistant structures in spite of chemical, biological, and physical erosion depends on their exceedingly high rates of calcification. Coral mortality due to bleaching (caused by global warming) and ocean acidification caused by atmospheric CO2 increase are now the major threats to the existence of these unique ecosystems. When the rates of dissolution and erosion become higher than the rates of precipitation, the entire coral ecosystem starts to collapse and will eventually be reduced to piles of rubble while its magnificent and high diversity fauna will vanish. The loss to nature and to humanity would be unprecedented and it may occur within the next 50 years. In this chapter, we discuss the issue of ocean acidification and its major effects of corals from the cell level to the reef communities. Based on the recently published literature, it can be generalized that calcification in corals is strongly reduced when seawater become slightly acidified. Ocean acidification lowers both the pH and the CO32- ion concentration in the surface ocean, but calcification at the organism level responds mainly to CO32- and not to pH. Most reports show that the symbiotic algae are not sensitive to changes in the carbonate chemistry. The potential mechanisms responsible for coral sensitivity to acidification are either direct input of seawater to the biomineralization site or high sensitivity of the enzymes involved in calcification to pH and/or CO2 concentrations. Increase in pH at the biomineralization site is most probably the most energy demanding process that is influenced by ocean acidification. While hermatypic corals and other calcifiers reduce their rates of calcification, chemical and biological dissolution increase and hence net calcification of the entire coral reef is decreasing dramatically. Community metabolism in several sites and in field enclosures show in some cases net dissolution. Using the relations between aragonite saturation (Omega(arag)) and community calcification, it is possible to predict that coral reefs globally may start to dissolve when atmospheric CO2 doubles.",Biodiversity \& Conservation; Marine \& Freshwater Biology,2011.2079,excluded,
