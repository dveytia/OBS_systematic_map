Securing the Demographic and Genetic Future of Tuatara through Assisted Colonization,"Miller, Kimberly A. and Miller, Hilary C. and Moore, Jennifer A. and Mitchell, Nicola J. and Cree, Alison and Allendorf, Fred W. and Sarre, Stephen D. and Keall, Susan N. and Nelson, Nicola J.",2012,Conservation Biology,"Climate change poses a particular threat to species with fragmented distributions and little or no capacity to migrate. Assisted colonization, moving species into regions where they have not previously occurred, aims to establish populations where they are expected to survive as climatic envelopes shift. However, adaptation to the source environment may affect whether species successfully establish in new regions. Assisted colonization has spurred debate among conservation biologists and ecologists over whether the potential benefits to the threatened species outweigh the potential disruption to recipient communities. In our opinion, the debate has been distracted by controversial examples, rather than cases where assisted colonization may be a viable strategy. We present a strategic plan for the assisted migration of tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), an endemic New Zealand reptile. The plan includes use of extant populations as reference points for comparisons with assisted-colonization populations with respect to demography, phenotypic plasticity, and phenology; optimization of genetic variation; research to fill knowledge gaps; consideration of host and recipient communities; and inclusion of stakeholders in the planning stage. When strategically planned and monitored, assisted colonization could meet conservation and research goals and ultimately result in the establishment of long-term sustainable populations capable of persisting during rapid changes in climate.",Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology,2012.4114,excluded,
OCEAN SPRAWL: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENT IN A CHANGING WORLD,"Firth, Louise B. and Knights, Antony M. and Bridger, Danielle and Evans, Ally J. and Mieszkowska, Nova and Moore, Pippa J. and O'Connor, Nessa E. and Sheehan, Emma V. and Thompson, Richard C. and Hawkins, Stephen J.",2016,NANA,"The last few decades have seen rapid proliferation of hard artificial structures (e.g., energy infrastructure, aquaculture, coastal defences) in the marine environment: ocean sprawl. The replacement of natural, often sedimentary, substrata with hard substrata has altered the distribution of species, particularly non-indigenous species, and can facilitate the assisted migration of native species at risk from climate change. This has been likened to urbanization as a driver of global biotic homogenization in the marine environment the process by which species invasions and extinctions increase the genetic, taxonomic, or functional similarity of communities at local, regional, and global scales. Ecological engineering research showed that small-scale engineering interventions can have a significant positive effect on the biodiversity associated with artificial structures, promoting more diverse and resilient communities on local scales. This knowledge can be applied to the design of multifunctional structures that provide a range of ecosystem services. In coastal regions, hybrid designs can work with nature to combine hard and soft approaches to coastal defence in a more environmentally sensitive manner. The challenge now is to manage ocean sprawl with the dual goal of supporting human populations and activities, simultaneously strengthening ecosystem resilience using an ecosystem-based approach.",Marine \& Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,2016.19,selected,
The Active Reef Restoration Toolbox is a Vehicle for Coral Resilience and Adaptation in a Changing World,"Rinkevich, Baruch",2019,Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering,"The accelerating marks of climate change on coral-reef ecosystems, combined with the recognition that traditional management measures are not efficient enough to cope with climate change tempo and human footprints, have raised a need for new approaches to reef restoration. The most widely used approach is the ``coral gardening{''} tenet; an active reef restoration tactic based on principles, concepts, and theories used in silviculture. During the relatively short period since its inception, the gardening approach has been tested globally in a wide range of reef sites, and on about 100 coral species, utilizing hundreds of thousands of nursery-raised coral colonies. While still lacking credibility for simulating restoration scenarios under forecasted climate change impacts, and with a limited adaptation toolkit used in the gardening approach, it is still deficient. Therefore, novel restoration avenues have recently been suggested and devised, and some have already been tested, primarily in the laboratory. Here, I describe seven classes of such novel avenues and tools, which include the improved gardening methodologies, ecological engineering approaches, assisted migration/colonization, assisted genetics/evolution, assisted microbiome, coral epigenetics, and coral chimerism. These are further classified into three operation levels, each dependent on the success of the former level. Altogether, the seven approaches and the three operation levels represent a unified active reef restoration toolbox, under the umbrella of the gardening tenet, focusing on the enhancement of coral resilience and adaptation in a changing world.",Engineering; Oceanography,2019.1087,selected,
Potential impact of CO2 emissions on the seafloor,"Caramanna, G. and Hennige, S.",2014,Advances In Environmental Research,"Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) aims to capture CO2 from fossil-fuel sources, transport and store it in suitable geological formations where it will be confined for extremely prolonged times. This is considered a feasible way of mitigating global warming. The seafloor is one of the target areas to safely store large volumes of anthropogenic CO2 through the development of sub-seabed CO2 geological storage. For the UK and large parts of Europe, the North Sea is potentially the most suitable location for CCS projects required to achieve planned targets in the reduction of CO2 emission. Other sub-seabed areas are studied for their storage potential in America and Asia. Even if the technology is considered proven, following the experience gained from the oil industry in using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and a few CO2 storage pilot projects, the risk of CO2 seepage must be addressed considering potential consequences on the marine environment. CO2 emissions may affect the seafloor with physical (e.g. sediments displacement), chemical (e.g. acidification) and biological (e.g. toxicity) effects. Laboratory experiments and the study of natural submarine CO2 vents are contributing to the development of a solid body of knowledge on these effects. The research is largely multidisciplinary, requiring expertise in natural sciences, engineering, chemistry and physics. The main observed consequences of CO2 emissions are a quick and strong acidification of the environment which may lead to the mobilization of pollutants, such as heavy metals, within the sedimentary cover of the seafloor diffusing within the overlying water column. Increased weathering of calcareous substrata is also likely following exposure to CO2- enriched fluids. Potential impacts upon local biodiversity would include displaced dissolved oxygen leading to anoxic regions, and localised ocean acidification. Consequences of increased CO2 would be a reduction in local seawater pH, and in the availability of carbonate ions required by calcifying organisms to grow. Predicted CO2 levels from potential seeps would lead to dissolution of exposed calcium carbonate shells and skeletons of local organisms. While some species would be able to tolerate and survive in such situations, others would die or suffer reduced growth rates. This is particularly pertinent for sessile benthic organisms which could not migrate following the onset of seepage. Naturally occurring submarine CO2 vents located along active tectonic and volcanic areas provide a good example of how organism communities change depending on their proximity to released CO2. For example, coral survival and growth decreases the closer they are to the CO2 vents, with macroalgae dominating the habitat instead. The timing and duration of potential industrial CO2 seeps would preclude the possibility of organism genetic adaptation over successive generations, and as such, possible impacts would depend upon organism acclimation potential and resilience. This chapter reviews the physical, chemical and biological implications of subseabed storage of CO2, and the consequences of potential seep events. Â© 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Shaping Improvised Directions for More Efficient Coral Reefs Rehabilitation Attempts,"Abd-Elgawad, Amro and Mohamed, Hala and Hellal, Ahmed and Guo, Haixia and Cai, Rongshuo",2022,Polish Journal Of Environmental Studies,"Coral reefs directly support more than 500 million people globally, usually in poor countries. More than 40 years ago, scientists initiated the discussion on coral reefs habitat destruction. Scientific research has covered various impacts on coral reefs including human pressures and climate change. Evidently ocean warming and acidification emerged as the main threats in the past decades. Currently, tropical coral reefs and their community are expected to face a tremendous increasing risk as global-warming raises. Such emerged combined stressors (human and climatic drivers) lead to slow recovery of corals with expectations of shift in species biodiversity and composition. Hence, coral reefs rehabilitation interventions have strikingly increased over the past decade. These interventions are carried through both, advanced science-based projects (such as coral microbiome engineering, ecological processes recruitment as well as community-based projects. The later occurs because of poor communication among the main three parties in charge (practitioners, MPAs managers with policymakers, and scientists) which in turn has led to unsatisfactory results in these rehabilitation attempts. The analysis of these results here revealed that most deficiencies are related to projects design. Engagement of these respective parties in a scientific framework through ``adopting a cautionary coral reefs rehabilitation strategy{''} will manage the general steps of adaptive decision making, and elude knowledge gaps that exist in certain drivers (Bioecological and Socio-economic) and common deficiencies in projects design. This will help quantifying rehabilitation measures and shaping these improvised directions for more efficient rehabilitation attempts. Avoiding this strategy is highly likely to result in another direct human impact on coral reefs in the Anthropocene. In this review, we summarize the story of past gains with evidence to new shaping of rehabilitative intervention directions for more resolutely efficient attempts. This is represented via simple pathway diagrams, and updated map which indicate the relationship between attempts objective and outcomes and charts showing drivers for success of coral rehabilitation. We attempt to answer the following question: How necessary is it to have a unified coral reefs rehabilitation cautionary strategy with an action plan?",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology,2022.37,selected,
Microbiome engineering: enhancing climate resilience in corals,"Epstein, Hannah E. and Smith, Hillary A. and Torda, Gergely and van Oppen, Madeleine J. H.",2019,Frontiers In Ecology And The Environment,"The world's coral reefs are under unparalleled pressure due to climate change, stimulating research focused on preventing further damage and loss in these ecosystems. The coral microbiome has been widely acknowledged as crucial to coral health and function, playing multiple roles in key biological processes. Recent empirical studies suggest that microbes may contribute to coral host tolerance of thermal stress, and harnessing these benefits through microbiome engineering (ME) may provide a mechanism for enhancing climate resilience in corals. Although coral ME is in its infancy, similar and successful ME approaches that are already underway in other fields - including agriculture, medicine, and wastewater treatment - may serve to guide and improve ME techniques in corals. We discuss current applications of ME, identify three key research priorities that will help elucidate the viability of ME for corals, and consider the implications of using these approaches for reef restoration.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology,2019.4943,selected,
BIODIVERSITY ON THE BRINK: THE ROLE OF ``ASSISTED MIGRATION{''} IN MANAGING ENDANGERED SPECIES THREATENED WITH RISING SEAS,"Lopez, Jaclyn",2015,Harvard Environmental Law Review,"Coastal areas in the United States are already experiencing the effects of sea-level rise, and the best available science predicts significant additional sea-level rise this century. In addition to sea-level rise, storm intensity and storm surge are also increasing. In some coastal areas, continuing population growth is compounding the threats of climate change and sea-level rise. At the same time, one in six of the federally listed endangered and threatened species in the United States is threatened by sea-level rise. Coastal species face displacement, extirpation, and even extinction due to loss of habitat. They are at risk of being trapped between rising sea levels and human development. This threat is exacerbated by unyielding human-made coastal fortifications. This coalescence of factors leads to the phenomenon known as ``coastal squeeze{''} the loss of transitional habitat between land and sea. For coastal areas this means that some of the most imperiled species will be pushed closer to the brink of extinction. ``Assisted migration{''} refers to one policy prescription to address this problem. The federal government, through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, has the authority and responsibility to consider active and passive assisted migration under the Endangered Species Act in managing species threatened with habitat loss due to sea-level rise. The federally protected Florida panther, logger-head sea turtle, Key tree-cactus, and Lower Keys marsh rabbit inhabit critically imperiled habitat in south Florida and are analyzed to examine this issue from the perspective of species from differing taxa, habitat types, and natural histories. This Article concludes that assisted migration, coupled with preserve and corridor protection and dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, are necessary for the conservation of imperiled species threatened with sea-level rise.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Government \& Law,2015.866,selected,
"The contribution of human capital to a holistic response to climate change: learning from and for the Mekong Delta, Vietnam","Collins, Ngan and Jones, Sandra and Tin Hong Nguyen and Stanton, Pauline",2017,Asia Pacific Business Review,"The Mekong Delta has been identified by the International Panel on Climate Change as one of the three most vulnerable areas in the world as sea levels rise due to climate change. The Vietnam Government has implemented a range of policies to assist migration in order to address these environmental problems. While much research has focused on the environmental causes of, and responses to, climate change there has been less research on the impact of environmentally motivated responses to climate change on labour force and human capital factors. This paper examines the experience of the Vietnam Government in encouraging internal migration from vulnerable agricultural areas to urban industrial cities, to explore the human capital effects of these environmentally motivated response to climate change. The paper first presents the environmental argument for migration in response to climate change, together with examples of what the Vietnam Government has done to encourage migration from the rural (originating) areas to other rural resettlement and city (receiving) areas. It then uses data collected as part of recent study into the impact of government encouragement for internal migration to explore the labour force and human capital impacts in both the originating region and receiving areas. The findings suggest that while there are social and economic advantages there are challenges, including ensuring that job opportunities are available, migrants and appropriate skills, and that labour contracts provide for job security and healthy and safe working result in improved living conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a more integrated approach that acknowledges and addresses associated human capital (skills upgrading) and business development needs and integrates these with environmentally-motivated policies.",Business \& Economics,2017.14126,selected,
Climate change and aquaculture: considering adaptation potential,"Reid, Gregor K. and Gurney-Smith, Helen J. and Flaherty, Mark and Garber, Amber F. and Forster, Ian and Brewer-Dalton, Kathy and Knowler, Duncan and Marcogliese, David J. and Chopin, Thierry and Moccia, Richard D. and Smith, Caitlin T. and De Silva, Sena",2019,Aquaculture Environment Interactions,"Increases in global population and seafood demand are occurring simultaneously with fisheries decline in an era of rapid climate change. Aquaculture is well positioned to help meet the world's future seafood needs, but heavy reliance of most global aquaculture on the ambient environment and ecosystem services suggests inherent vulnerability to climate change effects. There are, however, opportunities for adaptation. Engineering and management solutions can reduce exposure to stressors or mitigate stressors through environmental control. Epigenetic adaptation may have the potential to improve stressor tolerance through parental or early life stage exposure. Stressor-resistant traits can be genetically selected for, and maintaining adequate population variability can improve resilience and overall fitness. Information at appropriate time scales is crucial for adaptive response, such as real-time data on stressor levels and/or species' responses, early warning of deleterious events, or prediction of longer-term change. Diet quality and quantity have the potential to meet increasing energetic and nutritional demands associated with mitigating the effects of abiotic and biotic climate change stressors. Research advancements in understanding how climate change affects aquaculture will benefit most from a combination of empirical studies, modelling approaches, and observations at the farm level. Research to support aquaculture adaptation requires an increasing amount of environmental data to guide biological response studies for regional applications. Increased experimental complexity, resources, and duration will be necessary to better understand the effects of multiple stressors. Ultimately, in order for aquaculture sectors to move beyond short-term coping responses, governance initiatives incorporating the changing needs of stakeholders, users, and culture ecosystems as a whole are required to facilitate planned climate change adaptation and mitigation.",Fisheries; Marine \& Freshwater Biology,2019.736,selected,
Importance of species translocations under rapid climate change,"Butt, Nathalie and Chauvenet, Alienor L.

M. and Possingham, Hugh P.",2021,Conservation Biology,"Species that cannot adapt or keep pace with a changing climate are likely to need human intervention to shift to more suitable climates. While hundreds of articles mention using translocation as a climate-change adaptation tool, in practice, assisted migration as a conservation action remains rare, especially for animals. This is likely due to concern over introducing species to places where they may become invasive. However, there are other barriers to consider, such as time-frame mismatch, sociopolitical, knowledge and uncertainty barriers to conservationists adopting assisted migration as a go-to strategy. We recommend the following to advance assisted migration as a conservation tool: attempt assisted migrations at small scales, translocate species with little invasion risk, adopt robust monitoring protocols that trigger an active response, and promote political and public support.",Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology,2021.115,excluded,
"Blue carbon: past, present and future, with emphasis on macroalgae","Raven, John",2018,Biology Letters,"Blue carbon did not originally include macroalgal ecosystems; however evidence is mounting that macroalgal ecosystems function in marine carbon sequestration. The great majority of present day marine macroalgal net primary productivity (NPP) involves haptophytic algae on eroding shores. For these organisms the long-term storage of particulate organic carbon involves export from the site of production of biomass that has evaded parasites and grazers, and that some of the exported biomass is sedimented and stored rather than being mineralized en route by detritivores (microbes and fauna). Export from eroding shores, and subsequent storage, of haptophytic marine macroalgal particulate organic carbon could have started by 1.6 Ga. Storage on depositing shores close to the site of NPP by rhizophytic macroalgae and then by rhizophytic coastal seagrasses, tidal marshes and mangroves began not less than 209 Ma ago. Future increases in surface ocean temperatures may bring tropical marine macroalgae to their upper temperature limit, while temperate marine macroalgae will migrate poleward, in both cases assuming that temperature increases faster than genetic adaptation to higher temperature. Increased CO2 in the surface ocean will generally favour uncalcified over calcified marine macroalgae. This results in decreased CO2 release from decreased calcification, as well as decreased ballasting by CaCO3 of exported particulate organic carbon resulting in decreasing sedimentation. While much more work is needed, the available information suggests that macroalgae play a significant role in marine organic carbon storage.",Life Sciences \& Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,2018.4569,selected,
Perceived Barriers to the Use of Assisted Colonization for Climate Sensitive Species in the Hawaiian Islands,"Rivera, Shannon N. and Fortini, Lucas Berio and Plentovich, Sheldon and Price, Melissa R.",2021,Environmental Management,"Conservation actions to safeguard climate change vulnerable species may not be utilized due to a variety of perceived barriers. Assisted colonization, the intentional movement and release of an organism outside its historical range, is one tool available for species predicted to lose habitat under future climate change scenarios, particularly for single island or single mountain range endemic species. Despite the existence of policies that allow for this action, to date, assisted colonization has rarely been utilized for species of conservation concern in the Hawaiian Islands. Given the potential for climate driven biodiversity loss, the Hawaiian Islands are a prime location for the consideration of adaptation strategies. We used first-person interviews with conservation decision makers, managers, and scientists who work with endangered species in the Hawaiian Islands to identify perceived barriers to the use of assisted colonization. We found that assisted colonization was often not considered or utilized due to a lack of expertize with translocations; ecological risk and uncertainty, economic constraints, concerns regarding policies and permitting, concerns with public perception, and institutional resistance. Therefore, conservation planners may benefit from decision tools that integrate risk and uncertainty into decision models, and compare potential outcomes among conservation actions under consideration, including assisted colonization. Within a decision framework that addresses concerns, all conservation actions for climate sensitive species, including assisted colonization, may be considered in a timely manner.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology,2021.118,excluded,not specific to ocean
Estimates of genetic variability and inbreeding in experimentally selected populations of European sea bass,"Hillen, J. E.

M.",2017,Aquaculture,"The aquaculture industry has increasingly aimed at improving economically important traits like growth, feed efficiency and resistance to infections. Artificial selection represents an important window of opportunity to significantly improve production. However, the pitfall is that selection will reduce genetic diversity and increase inbreeding in the farmed stocks. Genetic tools are very useful in this context as they provide accurate measures of genetic diversity together with many additional insights in the stock status and the selection process. In this study we assessed the level of genetic variability and relatedness over several generations of two lines of experimentally selected European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.). The first line was selected for growth over three generations and the second line for both high and low weight loss under a starvation regime over two generations. We used a genomic approach (2549 single nucleotide polymorphism markers derived from double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing) in combination with eight microsatellites to estimate genetic variation, relatedness, effective population size and genetic differentiation across generations. Individual heterozygosity estimates indicated that the selected lines showed no significant reduction in diversity compared with wild populations. There was, however, a decreasing trend in allelic richness, suggesting the loss of low frequency alleles. We compared the estimates of effective population size from genetic markers with pedigree information and found good correspondence between methods. This study provides important insights in the genetic consequences of selective breeding and demonstrates the operational use of the latest genomic tools to estimate variability, inbreeding and at a later stage domestication and artificial selection.",Fisheries; Marine \& Freshwater Biology,2017.6247,excluded,Not specific to climate change
Adaptation in marine invasion: a genetic perspective,"Tepolt, C. K.",2015,Biological Invasions,"Genetic adaptation-heritable changes that alter an organism's performance-may facilitate invasion at several scales, but is seldom considered in predicting and managing marine invasions. However, a growing body of research-largely based on emerging genetic approaches-suggests that adaptation is possible and potentially widespread in the marine realm. Here, I review evidence for adaptation in marine invasion, considering both quantitative and genetic studies. Quantitative studies, which consider trait-based differences between populations or individuals without directly examining genetic makeup, have suggested local adaptation in several high-profile species. This implies that invasion risk may not be constant from population to population within a species, a key assumption of most invasion models. However, in many quantitative studies, the effects of heritable adaptive changes may be confounded with the effects of plasticity. Molecular approaches can help disentangle these effects, and studies at the genomic level are beginning to elucidate the specific genetic patterns and pathways underlying adaptation in invasion. While studies at this scale are currently rare in the marine invasion literature, they are likely to become increasingly prevalent-and useful-now that next-generation sequencing approaches have become tractable in non-model systems. Both traditional and emerging genetic approaches can improve our understanding of adaptation in marine invasions, and can aid managers in making accurate predictions of invasion spread and risk.",Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology,2015.496,excluded,Not specific to climate change
Adaptive responses of free-living and symbiotic microalgae to simulated future ocean conditions,"Chan, W.Y. and Oakeshott, J.G. and Buerger, P. and Edwards, O.R. and van Oppen, M.J.H.",2021,Global Change Biology,"Marine microalgae are a diverse group of microscopic eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms capable of photosynthesis. They are important primary producers and carbon sinks but their physiology and persistence are severely affected by global climate change. Powerful experimental evolution technologies are being used to examine the potential of microalgae to respond adaptively to current and predicted future conditions, as well as to develop resources to facilitate species conservation and restoration of ecosystem functions. This review synthesizes findings and insights from experimental evolution studies of marine microalgae in response to elevated temperature and/or pCO2. Adaptation to these environmental conditions has been observed in many studies of marine dinoflagellates, diatoms and coccolithophores. An enhancement in traits such as growth and photo-physiological performance and an increase in upper thermal limit have been shown to be possible, although the extent and rate of change differ between microalgal taxa. Studies employing multiple monoclonal replicates showed variation in responses among replicates and revealed the stochasticity of mutations. The work to date is already providing valuable information on speciesâ€™ climate sensitivity or resilience to managers and policymakers but extrapolating these insights to ecosystem- and community-level impacts continues to be a challenge. We recommend future work should include in situ experiments, diurnal and seasonal fluctuations, multiple drivers and multiple starting genotypes. Fitness trade-offs, stable versus plastic responses and the genetic bases of the changes also need investigating, and the incorporation of genome resequencing into experimental designs will be invaluable.

Cumulative bleaching undermines systemic resilience of the Great Barrier Reef,"Cheung, Mandy W. M. and Hock, Karlo and Skirving, William and Mumby, Peter J.",2021,Current Biology,"Climate change and ENSO have triggered five mass coral bleaching events on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR), three of which occurred in the last 5 years.(1-5) Here, we explore the cumulative nature of recent impacts and how they fragment the reef's connectivity. The coverage and intensity of thermal stress have increased steadily over time. Cumulative bleaching in 2016, 2017, and 2020 is predicted to have reduced systemic larval supply by 26\%, 50\%, and 71\%, respectively. Larval disruption is patchy and can guide interventions. The majority of severely bleached reefs (75\%) are predicted to have experienced an 80\%-100\% loss of larval supply. Yet restoration would not be cost-effective in the 2\% of such reefs (similar to 30) that still experience high larval supply. Managing such climate change impacts will benefit from emerging theory on the facilitation of genetic adaptation,(6,7) which requires the existence of regions with predictably high or low thermal stress. We find that a third of reefs constitute warm spots that have consistently experienced bleaching stress. Moreover, 13\% of the GBR are potential refugia that avoid significant warming more than expected by chance, with a modest proportion (14\%) within highly protected areas. Coral connectivity is likely to become increasingly disrupted given the predicted escalation of climate-driven disturbances,(8) but the existence of thermal refugia, potentially capable of delivering larvae to 58\% of the GBR, may provide pockets of systemic resilience in the near-term. Theories of conservation planning for climate change will need to consider a shifting portfolio of thermal environments over time.",Biochemistry \& Molecular Biology; Life Sciences \& Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,2021.15503,selected,
Are bivalves susceptible to domestication selection? Using starvation tolerance to test for potential trait changes in eastern oyster larvae,"McFarland, Katherine and Plough, Louis V. and Nguyen, Michelle and Hare, Matthew P.",2020,Plos One,"Conservation efforts are increasingly being challenged by a rapidly changing environment, and for some aquatic species the use of captive rearing or selective breeding is an attractive option. However, captivity itself can impose unintended artificial selection known as domestication selection (adaptation to culture conditions) and is relatively understudied for most marine species. To test for domestication selection in marine bivalves, we focused on a fitness-related trait (larval starvation resistance) that could be altered under artificial selection. Using larvae produced from a wild population ofCrassostrea virginicaand a selectively bred, disease-resistant line we measured growth and survival during starvation versus standard algal diet conditions. Larvae from both lineages showed a remarkable resilience to food limitation, possibly mediated by an ability to utilize dissolved organic matter for somatic maintenance. Water chemistry analysis showed dissolved organic carbon in filtered tank water to be at concentrations similar to natural river water. We observed that survival in larvae produced from the aquaculture line was significantly lower compared to larvae produced from wild broodstock (8 +/- 3\% and 21 +/- 2\%, respectively) near the end of a 10-day period with no food (phytoplankton). All larval cohorts had arrested growth and depressed respiration during the starvation period and took at least two days to recover once food was reintroduced before resuming growth. Respiration rate recovered rapidly and final shell length was similar between the two treatments Phenotypic differences between the wild and aquaculture lines suggest potential differences in the capacity to sustain extended food limitation, but this work requires replication with multiple selection lines and wild populations to make more general inferences about domestication selection. With this contribution we explore the potential for domestication selection in bivalves, discuss the physiological and fitness implications of reduced starvation tolerance, and aim to inspire further research on the topic.",Science \& Technology - Other Topics,2020.13906,selected,
Loss of transcriptional plasticity but sustained adaptive capacity after adaptation to global change conditions in a marine copepod,"Brennan, Reid S. and DeMayo, James A. and Dam, Hans G. and Finiguerra, Michael B. and Baumann, Hannes and Pespeni, Melissa H.",2022,Nature Communications,"Rapid adaptation will facilitate species resilience under global climate change, but its effects on plasticity are less commonly investigated. This study shows that 20 generations of experimental adaptation in a marine copepod drives a rapid loss of plasticity that carries costs and might have impacts on future resilience to environmental change. Adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity will fuel resilience in the geologically unprecedented warming and acidification of the earth's oceans, however, we have much to learn about the interactions and costs of these mechanisms of resilience. Here, using 20 generations of experimental evolution followed by three generations of reciprocal transplants, we investigated the relationship between adaptation and plasticity in the marine copepod, Acartia tonsa, in future global change conditions (high temperature and high CO2). We found parallel adaptation to global change conditions in genes related to stress response, gene expression regulation, actin regulation, developmental processes, and energy production. However, reciprocal transplantation showed that adaptation resulted in a loss of transcriptional plasticity, reduced fecundity, and reduced population growth when global change-adapted animals were returned to ambient conditions or reared in low food conditions. However, after three successive transplant generations, global change-adapted animals were able to match the ambient-adaptive transcriptional profile. Concurrent changes in allele frequencies and erosion of nucleotide diversity suggest that this recovery occurred via adaptation back to ancestral conditions. These results demonstrate that while plasticity facilitated initial survival in global change conditions, it eroded after 20 generations as populations adapted, limiting resilience to new stressors and previously benign environments.",Science \& Technology - Other Topics,2022.5052,selected,

On the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), an approximately 51\% decline in coral cover occurred over the period 1985-2012. We conducted a gene-by-environment association analysis across 12 degrees latitude on the GBR, as well as both in situ and laboratory genotype-by-phenotype association analyses. These analyses allowed us to identify alleles at two genetic loci that account for differences in environmental stress tolerance and antioxidant capacity in the common coral Acropora millepora. The effect size for antioxidant capacity was considerable and biologically relevant (32.5 and 14.6\% for the two loci). Antioxidant capacity is a critical component of stress tolerance because a multitude of environmental stressors cause increased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species. Our findings provide the first step toward the development of novel coral reef management approaches, such as spatial mapping of stress tolerance for use in marine protected area design, identification of stress-tolerant colonies for assisted migration, and marker-assisted selective breeding to create more tolerant genotypes for restoration of denuded reefs.",Science \& Technology - Other Topics,2016.7357,selected,
Acclimatization and Adaptive Capacity of Marine Species in a Changing Ocean,"Foo, S. A. and Byrne, M.",2016,NANA,"To persist in an ocean changing in temperature, pH and other stressors related to climate change, many marine species will likely need to acclimatize or adapt to avoid extinction. If marine populations possess adequate genetic variation in tolerance to climate change stressors, species might be able to adapt to environmental change. Marine climate change research is moving away from single life stage studies where individuals are directly placed into projected scenarios ('future shock' approach), to focus on the adaptive potential of populations in an ocean that will gradually change over coming decades. This review summarizes studies that consider the adaptive potential of marine invertebrates to climate change stressors and the methods that have been applied to this research, including quantitative genetics, laboratory selection studies and trans- and multigenerational experiments. Phenotypic plasticity is likely to contribute to population persistence providing time for genetic adaptation to occur. Transgenerational and epigenetic effects indicate that the environmental and physiological history of the parents can affect offspring performance. There is a need for long-term, multigenerational experiments to determine the influence of phenotypic plasticity, genetic variation and transgenerational effects on species' capacity to persist in a changing ocean. However, multigenerational studies are only practicable for short generation species. Consideration of multiple morphological and physiological traits, including changes in molecular processes (eg, DNA methylation) and long-term studies that facilitate acclimatization will be essential in making informed predictions of how the seascape and marine communities will be altered by climate change.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology,2016.911,excluded,
Preconditioning in the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis and the potential for trans-generational acclimatization in coral larvae under future climate change conditions,"Putnam, Hollie M. and Gates, Ruth D.",2015,Journal Of Experimental Biology,"Coral reefs are globally threatened by climate change-related ocean warming and ocean acidification (OA). To date, slow-response mechanisms such as genetic adaptation have been considered the major determinant of coral reef persistence, with little consideration of rapid-response acclimatization-mechanisms. These rapid mechanisms such as parental effects that can contribute to trans-generational acclimatization (e.g. epigenetics) have, however, been identified as important contributors to offspring response in other systems. We present the first evidence of parental effects in a cross-generational exposure to temperature and OA in reef-building corals. Here, we exposed adults to high (28.9 degrees C, 805 mu atm P-CO2) or ambient (26.5 degrees C, 417 mu atm P-CO2) temperature and OA treatments during the larval brooding period. Exposure to high treatment negatively affected adult performance, but their larvae exhibited size differences and metabolic acclimation when subsequently re-exposed, unlike larvae from parents exposed to ambient conditions. Understanding the innate capacity corals possess to respond to current and future climatic conditions is essential to reef protection and maintenance. Our results identify that parental effects may have an important role through (1) ameliorating the effects of stress through preconditioning and adaptive plasticity, and/or (2) amplifying the negative parental response through latent effects on future life stages. Whether the consequences of parental effects and the potential for trans-generational acclimatization are beneficial or maladaptive, our work identifies a critical need to expand currently proposed climate change outcomes for corals to further assess rapid response mechanisms that include non-genetic inheritance through parental contributions and classical epigenetic mechanisms.",Life Sciences \& Biomedicine - Other Topics,2015.5963,excluded,
Genetic Variation in Heat Tolerance of the Coral Platygyra Daedalea Indicates Potential for Adaptation to Ocean Warming,"Elder, Holland and Weis, Virginia M. and Montalvo-Proano, Jose and Mocellin, Veronique J. L. and Baird, Andrew H. and Meyer, Eli and Bay, Line K.",2022,Frontiers In Marine Science,"Ocean warming represents the greatest threat to the persistence of reef ecosystems. Most coral populations are projected to experience temperatures above their current bleaching thresholds annually by 2050. Adaptation to higher temperatures is necessary if corals are to persist in a warming future. While many aspects of heat stress have been well studied, few data are available for predicting the capacity for adaptive cross-generational responses in corals. Consistent sets of heat tolerant genomic markers that reliably predict thermal tolerance have yet to be identified. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified the heritability and genetic variation associated with heat tolerance in Platygyra daedalea from the Great Barrier Reef. We tracked the survival of ten quantitative genetic crosses of larvae produced form six parental colonies in a heat tolerance selection experiment. We also identified allelic shifts in heat-selected (35 degrees C) survivors compared with paired, non-selected controls (27 degrees C). The narrow-sense heritability of survival under heat stress was 0.66 and a total of 1,069 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with different survival probabilities. While 148 SNPs were shared between several experimental crosses, no common SNPs were identified for all crosses, which suggests that specific combinations of many markers are responsible for heat tolerance. However, we found two regions that overlap with previously identified loci associated with heat tolerance in Persian Gulf populations of P. daedalea, which reinforces the importance of these markers for heat tolerance. These results illustrate the importance of high heritability and the complexity of the genomic architecture underpinning host heat tolerance. These findings suggest that this P. daedalea population has the genetic prerequisites for adaptation to increasing temperatures. This study also provides knowledge for the development of high throughput genomic tools which may screen for variation within and across populations to enhance adaptation through assisted gene flow and assisted migration.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology,2022.6277,selected,
Genetic approaches for increasing fitness in endangered species,"Kosch, Tiffany A. and Waddle, Anthony W. and Cooper, Caitlin A. and Zenger, Kyall R. and Garrick, Dorian J. and Berger, Lee and Skerratt, Lee F.",2022,Trends In Ecology \& Evolution,"The global rate of wildlife extinctions is accelerating, and the persistence of many species requires conservation breeding programs. A central paradigm of these programs is to preserve the genetic diversity of the founder populations. However, this may preserve original characteristics that make them vulnerable to extinction. We introduce targeted genetic intervention (TGI) as an alternative approach that promotes traits that enable species to persist in the face of threats by changing the incidence of alleles that impact on fitness. The TGI toolkit includes methods with established efficacy in model organisms and agriculture but are largely untried for conservation, such as synthetic biology and artificial selection. We explore TGI approaches as a species-restoration tool for intractable threats including infectious disease and climate change.",Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics \& Heredity,2022.16055,excluded,Not specific to the ocean
"Adaptation, extinction and global change","Bell, Graham and Collins, Sinead",2008,Evolutionary Applications,"We discuss three interlinked issues: the natural pace of environmental change and adaptation, the likelihood that a population will adapt to a potentially lethal change, and adaptation to elevated CO2, the prime mover of global change. 1. Environmental variability is governed by power laws showing that ln difference in conditions increases with ln elapsed time at a rate of 0.3-0.4. This leads to strong but fluctuating selection in many natural populations. 2. The effect of repeated adverse change on mean fitness depends on its frequency rather than its severity. If the depression of mean fitness leads to population decline, however, severe stress may cause extinction. Evolutionary rescue from extinction requires abundant genetic variation or a high mutation supply rate, and thus a large population size. Although natural populations can sustain quite intense selection, they often fail to adapt to anthropogenic stresses such as pollution and acidification and instead become extinct. 3. Experimental selection lines of algae show no specific adaptation to elevated CO2, but instead lose their carbon-concentrating mechanism through mutational degradation. This is likely to reduce the effectiveness of the oceanic carbon pump. Elevated CO2 is also likely to lead to changes in phytoplankton community composition, although it is not yet clear what these will be. We emphasize the importance of experimental evolution in understanding and predicting the biological response to global change. This will be one of the main tasks of evolutionary biologists in the coming decade.",Evolutionary Biology,2008.3529,excluded,
Sea change under climate change: case studies in rare plant conservation from the dynamic San Francisco Estuary,"Grewell, Brenda J. and Espeland, Erin K. and Fiedler, Peggy L.",2013,Botany,"We present case studies supporting management of two rare plant species in tidal wetlands of the San Francisco Estuary. We used empirical demographic analyses to identify factors to enhance population establishment and survival of Chloropyron molle subsp. molle (Orobancaceae), an annual hemiparasite, and to compare reintroduced with natural populations. Twelve years after outplanting, the reintroduced population persists but is in decline; impediments to success include the lack of adaptive management response to weed invasions and muted variance in hydrology. Transplantation of Lilaeopsis masonii (Apiaceae), a rhizomatous perennial herb, failed to meet success criteria for mitigation at local project scale, but dispersal and establishment of metapopulation patches indicated persistence at the landscape scale. This species has been found to be genetically indistinct from a widespread congener, and has few threats to persistence so long as suitable habitat is present. These two examples demonstrate the need for integrated conservation management strategies that prioritize habitat connectivity and maintain physical processes to support dispersal in response to sea level rise. For the hemiparasite, assisted colonization may sustain populations threatened by sea level rise, but only if a strong commitment to effective stewardship is realized.",Plant Sciences,2013.313,selected,
Contrasting effects of Symbiodinium identity on coral host transcriptional profiles across latitudes,"Barfield, Sarah J. and Aglyamova, Galina V. and Bay, Line K. and Matz, Mikhail V.",2018,Molecular Ecology,"Reef-building corals can increase their resistance to heat-induced bleaching through adaptation and acclimatization and/or by associating with a more thermo-tolerant strain of algal symbiont (Symbiodinium sp.). Here, we show that these two adaptive pathways interact. We collected Acropora millepora corals from two contrasting thermal environments on the Great Barrier Reef: cooler, mid-latitude Orpheus Island, where all corals hosted a heat-sensitive clade C Symbiodinium, and warmer, low-latitude Wilkie Island, where corals hosted either a clade C or a more thermo-tolerant clade D. Corals were kept in a benign common garden to reveal differences in baseline gene expression, reflecting prior adaptation/long-term acclimatization. Model-based analysis identified gene expression differences between Wilkie and Orpheus corals that were negatively correlated with previously described transcriptome-wide signatures of heat stress, signifying generally elevated thermotolerance of Wilkie corals. Yet, model-free analyses of gene expression revealed that Wilkie corals hosting clade C were distinct from Wilkie corals hosting clade D, whereas Orpheus corals were more variable. Wilkie corals hosting clade C symbionts exhibited unique functional signatures, including downregulation of histone proteins and ion channels and upregulation of chaperones and RNA processing genes, putatively representing constitutive frontloading of stress response genes. Furthermore, clade C Symbiodinium exhibited constitutive expression differences between Wilkie and Orpheus, indicative of contrasting life history strategies. Our results demonstrate that hosting alternative Symbiodinium types is associated with different pathways of local adaptation for the coral host. These interactions could play a significant role in setting the direction of genetic adaptation to global warming in the two symbiotic partners.",Biochemistry \& Molecular Biology; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,2018.828,excluded,
"Coral microbiome dynamics, functions and design in a changing world","van Oppen, Madeleine J. H. and Blackall, Linda L.",2019,Nature Reviews Microbiology,"Corals associate not only with dinoflagellates, which are their algal endosymbionts and which have been extensively studied over the past four decades, but also with a variety of other microorganisms. The coral microbiome includes dinoflagellates, viruses, fungi, archaea and bacteria, with knowledge of the latter growing rapidly. This Review focuses on the bacterial members of the coral microbiome and draws parallels with better-studied microbiomes in other biological systems. We synthesize current understanding of spatial, temporal and host-specific patterns in coral-associated bacterial communities, the drivers shaping these patterns, and the role of the microbiome in acclimatization and adaptation of the host to climate warming. We discuss how this knowledge can be harnessed to assist the future persistence of coral reefs and provide novel perspectives for the development of microbiome engineering and its implications for coral reef conservation and restoration.",Microbiology,2019.8907,selected,
Climate change and coconut plantations in India: Impacts and potential adaptation gains,"Kumar, S. Naresh and Aggarwal, P. K.",2013,Agricultural Systems,"The assessment of impact of climate change on coconut, a plantation crop, is challenging. However, the development of a simulation model (InfoCrop-COCONUT) has enabled the process. We present the first simulation analysis of the potential impacts of climate change on coconut productivity in India following two approaches, namely: (i) `fixed increase in temperature and CO2, and (ii) scenarios as per PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impact Studies) - a regional climate model. Impact of changed management on coconut productivity in current as well as in future climates is also assessed. Climate change is projected to increase coconut productivity in western coastal region, Kerala, parts of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra (provided current level of water and management is made available in future climates as well) and also in North-Eastern states, islands of Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep while negative impacts are projected for Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal, Gujarat and parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. On all India basis, even with current management, climate change is projected to increase coconut productivity by 4.3\% in A1B 2030, 1.9\% in A1B 2080, 6.8\% in A2 2080 and 5.7\% in 82 2080 scenarios of PRECIS over mean productivity of 2000-2005 period. Agronomic adaptations like soil moisture conservation, summer irrigation, drip irrigation, and fertilizer application cannot only minimize losses in majority of coconut growing regions, but also improve productivity substantially. Further, genetic adaptation measures like growing improved local Tall cultivars and hybrids under improved crop management is needed for long-term adaptation of plantation to climate change, particularly in regions that are projected to be negatively impacted by climate change. Such strategy can increase the productivity by about 33\% in 2030, and by 25-32\% in 2080 climate scenarios. In fact, productivity can be improved by 20\% to almost double if all plantations in India are provided with above mentioned management even in current climates. In places where positive impacts are projected, current poor management may become a limiting factor in reaping the benefits of CO2 fertilization, while in negatively affected regions adaptation strategies can reduce the impacts. Thus, intensive genetic and agronomic adaptation to climate change can substantially benefit the coconut production in India. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate change and the evolution of reef fishes: past and future,"Rummer, Jodie L. and Munday, Philip L.",2017,Fish And Fisheries,"Predicting the impacts of ocean warming and acidification on marine ecosystems requires an evolutionary perspective because, for most marine species, these environmental changes will occur over a number of generations. Acclimation through phenotypic plasticity and adaptation through genetic selection could help populations of some species cope with future warmer and more acidic oceans. Coral reef species are predicted to be some of the most vulnerable to climate change because they live close to their thermal limits. Yet, their evolutionary history may indicate that they possess adaptations that enable them to cope with a high CO2 environment. Here, we first explore the evolutionary history of reef fishes and how their history has shaped their physiological adaptations to environmental temperatures and pCO(2). We examine current-day thermal and CO2 environments experienced by coral reef fishes and summarize experimental studies that have tested how they respond to elevated temperatures and pCO(2) levels. We then examine evidence for acclimation and adaptation to projected ocean warming and acidification. Indeed, new studies have demonstrated the potential for transgenerational plasticity and heritable genetic variation that would allow some fishes to maintain performance as the oceans warm and become more acidic. We conclude by outlining management approaches - specifically those that can help preserve genetic variation by maintaining population size - to enhance the potential for genetic adaptation to climate change.",Fisheries,2017.10594,selected,
Climate change impacts on Australia's eucalypt and coral species: Comparing and sharing knowledge across disciplines,"Booth, Trevor H. and Muir, Paul R.",2020,Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews-climate Change,"Two of Australia's most iconic ecosystems have recently sustained heavy damage related to climatic changes: the extensive eucalypt forests from catastrophic bushfires and the Great Barrier Reef from mass coral bleaching. Despite obvious differences, eucalypt trees and reef corals share some similarities in biology and ecology, particularly in relation to climate change impacts and adaptation. Both groups are the focus of an increasing research effort to characterize and respond to climate changes and here we examine how sharing research experiences can benefit both fields. Four key areas of research are considered: (a) modeling current distributions, (b) assessing impacts of climate change on future distributions, (c) using human-assisted migration to improve survival, and (d) applying genetic enhancement to improve the species' survival. Examples of each research area are used to examine potential crossovers, limitations of the methods, and future requirements. We conclude that eucalypt and coral researchers, and indeed researchers for many other endangered taxa, can gain much by comparing experiences and methods, despite the apparent differences in their respective taxa.
