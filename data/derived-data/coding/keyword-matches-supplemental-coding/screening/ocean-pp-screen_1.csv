"Seeking natural analogs to fast-forward the assessment of marine CO2 removal","Bach, L.T. and Boyd, P.W.","2021","Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America","Mitigating global climate change will require gigaton-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) as a supplement to rapid emissions reduction. The oceans cover 71% of the Earth surface and have the potential to provide much of the required CDR. However, none of the proposed marine CDR (mCDR) methods is sufficiently well understood to determine their real-world efficiency and environmental side effects. Here, we argue that using natural mCDR analogs should become the third interconnecting pillar in the mCDR assessment as they bridge the gap between numerical simulations (i.e., large scale/reduced complexity) and experimental studies (i.e., small scale/high complexity). Natural mCDR analogs occur at no cost, can provide a wealth of data to inform mCDR, and do not require legal permission or social license for their study. We propose four simple criteria to identify particularly useful analogs: 1) large scale, 2) abruptness of perturbation, 3) availability of unperturbed control sites, and 4) reoccurrence. Based on these criteria, we highlight four examples: 1) equatorial upwelling as a natural analog for artificial upwelling, 2) downstream of Kerguelen Island for ocean iron fertilization, 3) the Black and Caspian Seas for ocean alkalinity enhancement, and 4) the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt for ocean afforestation. These natural analogs provide a reality check for experimental assessments and numerical modeling of mCDR. Ultimately, projections of mCDR efficacy and sustainability supported by observations from natural analogs will provide the real-world context for the public debate and will facilitate political decisions on mCDR implementation. We anticipate that a rigorous investigation of natural analogs will fast-forward the urgently needed assessment of mCDR. Â© 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

"Intelligent Control System of an Ecological Engineering Project for Carbon Sequestration in Coastal Mariculture Environments in China","Fan, Wei and Xiao, Canbo and Li, Peiliang and Zhang, Zhujun and Lin, Tiancheng and Pan, Yiwen and Di, Yanan and Chen, Ying","2020","Sustainability","As an ecological engineering project, artificial upwelling can enhance seaweed growth in the oligotrophic sea area by lifting bottom water, which is rich in nutrients, to the surface and thereby increase coastal carbon sequestration. Generally, engineering projects producing artificial upwelling occur far away from land and are self-powered using offshore solar energy or wind energy. The key to successfully implementing such engineering projects is to produce artificial upwelling with limited energy. With this in mind, an intelligent control system is designed for the energy management of the artificial upwelling engineering project that operates at AoShan Bay in Qingdao, China. This engineering project uses artificial upwelling to assist in the cultivation of macroalgae. The intelligent control system can automatically produce upwelling according to the battery condition and guarantee safety during operation. Meanwhile, users can monitor the system in real time with a Cloud platform. The functioning of the system and the effect of upwelling are confirmed by a sea trial. This research provides guidelines and technical support for the future design of intelligent control systems mounted on artificial upwelling engineering projects.","Science \& Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2020.5090","selected",""
"The Potential of Ocean Iron Fertilization as an Option for Mitigating Climate Change","Bertram, Christine","2011","NANA","Ocean iron fertilization is currently being discussed as one measure that could contribute to climate change mitigation by stimulating the growth of phytoplankton in certain parts of the ocean and enhancing oceanic CO2 uptake. Its implementation is greatly debated however and its mitigation potential has not yet been explored well. At present, it is still not possible to use carbon offsets generated through iron fertilization projects for complying with the Kyoto Protocol as trading these offsets is currently only possible on voluntary carbon markets. Company interests in such a commercial use of ocean iron fertilization do however already exist. Consequently, there is a need to explore the potential of ocean iron fertilization as a climate change mitigation option as well as regulatory issues connected with its implementation. This article combines these two aims by first examining the scientific background, quantitative potential, side effects and costs of ocean iron fertilization. In a second step, regulatory aspects such as its legal status and open access issues are reviewed. Moreover, the chapter analyses how the regulations for afforestation and reforestation activities within the framework of the Kyoto Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could be applied to ocean iron fertilization. The main findings of this chapter are that the quantitative potential of ocean iron fertilization is limited, that potential adverse side effects are severe, and that its costs are higher than it was initially hoped. Moreover, the legal status of ocean iron fertilization is currently not well defined, open access might cause inefficiencies, and the CDM regulations could not be easily applied to ocean iron fertilization.","Business \& Economics","2011.289","selected",""

"Experimental and Analytical investigations of Wave-Induced Artificial Upwelling","Lin, Shan and Yang, Jing and Chen, Ying and Liu, Junbo and Liu, Mingzhou and Chen, Jiawang and Zhang, Dahai and Fan, Wei and Huang, Haocai","2014","NANA","Artificial upwelling is supposed to be a general technique to enhance the marine primary productivity and fishery resources by means of pumping the nutrient-rich deep ocean water (DOW) to the euphotic layer. The wave energy is the most conspicuous form of ocean energy, the extraction of energy from the waves can be a viable economic solution to the power requirements of artificial upwelling. To extract the wave energy, a structure which responds to the input wave motion is required. This paper presents our latest investigation on the wave-induced artificial upwelling device by a fixed rigid pipe submerged in the water. In this study, we improve the theoretical methods, and the calculated results are verified by the wave-tank experiments. It turns out that the upwelling rate was affected of the wave height H, the wave period H, the water depth h, the length of the pipe L and diameter of the pipe d, etc. Based on the theoretical calculations and experimental results, we can estimate the upwelling flow rate of the wave-induced artificial upwelling device applied in the open sea.","Engineering; Oceanography","2014.8908","selected",""

"Role of the ocean in climate stabilization","Scott-Buechler, C.M. and Greene, C.H.","2019","Bioenergy With Carbon Capture And Storage: Using Natural Resources For Sustainable Development","The ocean has absorbed over 90% of the heat from recent anthropogenic greenhouse warming. This chapter reviews a variety of ocean-related methods for slowing down and eventually halting this warming. â€œBlue carbonâ€ reservoirs store more carbon than terrestrial equivalents, although are still limited compared with global negative emissions needs. Oceanic carbon uptake could be augmented via iron fertilization, although this method presents challenges. Algal-based biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (ABECCS) offers opportunities for carbon-neutral fuel alternatives as well as for negative emissions. Total carbon dioxide removal potential is estimated at 15-33 Pg CO2/year by mid-century and 33-95 Pg CO2/year by the end of the century, which could offset current and projected CO2 emissions. ABECCS can also coproduce high-protein feed for aquaculture and reduce demand for agricultural land. Combined with effective ocean blue carbon management and terrestrial methods, ocean-based carbon removal can play a critical role in climate stabilization. Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We reviewed the current knowledge on the development of an artificial upwelling system and its potential environmental effects. Special attention was given to the research progress on the air-lift concept artificial upwelling by Zhejiang University. The research on artificial upwelling over the past few decades has generated a range of devices that have been successfully applied in the field for months. Based on field experiments and the associated modeling results, part of them reported positive effects on increasing primary production and enhancing CO2 sequestration. However, as a significant disturbance to the environment, especially for large-scale applications, the uncertainties related to the potential effects on ecosystem remain unsolved. Zhejiang University has overcome the technical challenges in designing and fabricating a robust and high efficiency artificial upwelling device which has been examined in two field experiments in Qiandao Lake and one sea trial in the East China Sea. It was investigated that cold and hypoxic deep ocean water (DOW) could be uplifted to the euphotic layer, which could potentially change the nutrient distribution and adjust the N/P ratio. Both simulation and field experiments results confirmed that utilizing self-powered energy to inject compressed air to uplift DOW was a valid and efficient method. Therefore, further field-based research on artificial upwelling, especially for long-term field research is required to test the scientific hypothesis.","Geology","2016.1663","selected",""
"Offsetting the radiative benefit of ocean iron fertilization by enhancing N2O emissions","Jin, X and Gruber, N","2003","Geophysical Research Letters","Ocean iron fertilization is being considered as a strategy for mitigating the buildup of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere. Assessment of this strategy requires consideration of its unintended consequences, such as an enhancement of ocean N2O emissions. This feedback could offset the radiative benefit from the atmospheric CO2 reduction significantly, because N2O is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2 itself. Our model results show that the magnitude of this offsetting effect is substantial, but is highly dependent on the location and duration of fertilization. We find the largest offsets (of the order of 100\%) when fertilization is undertaken in the tropics, particularly when it is of limited duration and size. Smaller, but still substantial effects are found when fertilization is undertaken elsewhere and over longer periods. These results suggest that any assessment of ocean fertilization as a mitigating option is incomplete without consideration of the N2O feedback.","Geology","2003.231","selected",""
"Expected Limits on the Potential for Carbon Dioxide Removal From Artificial Upwelling","Koweek, D.A.","2022","Frontiers In Marine Science","Artificial upwelling, the engineered upward pumping of deep ocean water, has long been proposed as a technique to fertilize the ocean and, more recently, remove atmospheric carbon dioxide. This study investigated the potential of artificial upwelling to contribute to carbon dioxide removal using a simple model with high-resolution (1Â° Ã— 1Â°) gridded monthly climatologies of upper ocean and deep ocean physical and chemical properties. The potential for carbon dioxide removal was explored across a range of observationally-informed carbon-to-nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios for microalgae and macroalgae communities, providing information on the sensitivity of the estimates to any assumed carbon-to-nutrient ratios. Simulated carbon dioxide removal across the tropical-to-subpolar ocean did not exceed 0.66 tons per square kilometer per year for microalgae, and did not exceed 0.85 tons per square kilometer per year for macroalgae. Using current technology, the estimated global aggregate potential for carbon dioxide removal using microalgae was less than 50 megatons (0.05 gigatons) of carbon dioxide annually and the estimated global aggregate potential for carbon dioxide removal using macroalgae was approximately 100 megatons (0.1 gigatons) of carbon dioxide annually. While controlled field trials are needed to validate or invalidate the findings of this study, this study suggests that artificial upwelling is unlikely to support annual carbon dioxide removal at, or close to, the rate of one gigaton of carbon dioxide annually.

"Energy management and operational planning of an ecological engineering for carbon sequestration in coastal mariculture environments in China","Lin, T. and Fan, W. and Xiao, C. and Yao, Z. and Zhang, Z. and Zhao, R. and Pan, Y. and Chen, Y.","2019","Sustainability (switzerland)","China is now accelerating the development of an ecological engineering for carbon sequestration in coastal mariculture environments to cope with climate change. Artificial upwelling as the ecological engineering can mix surface water with bottom water and bring rich nutrients to the euphotic zone, enhance seaweed growth in the oligotrophic sea area, and then increase coastal carbon sequestration. However, one of the major obstacles of the artificial upwelling is the high energy consumption. This study focused on the development of energy management technology for air-lift artificial upwelling by optimizing air injection rate. The fundamental principle underlying this technology is that the mode and intensity of air injection are adjusted from the feedback of information on velocity variation in tidal currents, illumination, and temperature of the surface layer. A series of equations to control air injection was derived based on seaweed growth and solar power generation. Although this finding was originally developed for the air-lift artificial upwelling, it also can be used in other areas of engineering, such as water delivery, aeration, and oxygenation. The simulations show that using a variable air injection rate can lift more nitrogen nutrients of 28.2 mol than using a fixed air injection rate of 26.6 mol, mostly with the same energy cost. Using this control algorithm, the changed temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles prove the effective upwelling in the experiments and the average weights of kelp are 33.1 g in the experimental group and 10.1 g in the control group.

In this context, DCNS realised a preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment in order to prepare public debate to be done further. Due to innovation of such a project, a specific methodology has been done for that. First step was to study bibliography in details, for site assessment of course, but also for impacts of other projects in the world that should present relevant similarities with OTEC (coastal thermal power plants for example). This bibliographic study dealt with thematic synthesis for each topic of physical, biological and human field that could be impacted by the project (total of 28 topics). The aim was to define priorities for specific assessments that have been done further: acoustic impacts, biogeochemical impacts of artificial upwelling, biofouling impacts, etc. Some of these topics are now on course with specific scientific research programs that have been launched at the end of this study. For each new topic, a specific methodology has been used or adapted for OTEC.

"Climate intervention: Carbon dioxide removal and reliable sequestration","Committee on Geoengineering Climate: Technical Evaluation and Discussion of Impacts and Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate and Ocean Studies Board and Division on Earth and Life Studies and National Research Council","2015","Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal And Reliable Sequestration","The signals are everywhere that our planet is experiencing significant climate change. It is clear that we need to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from our atmosphere if we want to avoid greatly increased risk of damage from climate change. Aggressively pursuing a program of emissions abatement or mitigation will show results over a timescale of many decades. How do we actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make a bigger difference more quickly? As one of a two-book report, this volume of Climate Intervention discusses CDR, the carbon dioxide removal of greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere and sequestration of it in perpetuity. Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration introduces possible CDR approaches and then discusses them in depth. Land management practices, such as low-till agriculture, reforestation and afforestation, ocean iron fertilization, and land-and-ocean-based accelerated weathering, could amplify the rates of processes that are already occurring as part of the natural carbon cycle. Other CDR approaches, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration, direct air capture and sequestration, and traditional carbon capture and sequestration, seek to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and dispose of it by pumping it underground at high pressure. This book looks at the pros and cons of these options and estimates possible rates of removal and total amounts that might be removed via these methods. With whatever portfolio of technologies the transition is achieved, eliminating the carbon dioxide emissions from the global energy and transportation systems will pose an enormous technical, economic, and social challenge that will likely take decades of concerted effort to achieve. Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration will help to better understand the potential cost and performance of CDR strategies to inform debate and decision making as we work to stabilize and reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.

"Predicting and verifying the intended and unintended consequences of large-scale ocean iron fertilization","Cullen, John J. and Boyd, Philip W.","2008","Marine Ecology Progress Series","Ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is being considered as a strategy for mitigating rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. One model for implementation is the sale of carbon offsets. Modeling studies predict that OIF has the potential to produce a material difference in the rise of atmospheric CO2 over the next several decades, but this could only be attained by alteration of the ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles of much of the world's oceans. The efficacy of OIF on this scale has not been proven. However, the consequences of successful implementation must be considered now, for 2 important reasons: (1) to determine if the environmental effects would be predictable and verifiable, and if so, acceptable; and (2) to establish whether the basis for valuing carbon offsets-an accurate audit of net reductions in cumulative greenhouse gas potential over 100 yr-can be met. Potential side-effects of widespread OIF that must be considered include a reduced supply of macronutrients to surface waters downstream of fertilized regions, increased emissions of the potent greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and methane, and changes in the extent or frequency of coastal hypoxia. Given the uncertainties inherent in ocean models, predictions of environmental effects must be backed up by measurements. Thus, to go forward with confidence that the effects of rising CO2 could indeed be mitigated through OIF over the next century, and to establish the foundations for auditing carbon offsets, it must be explicitly demonstrated that methods exist to predict and detect downstream effects of OIF against the background of both climate variability and global warming. We propose that until the side-effects of widespread OIF can be shown to be verifiable-and there is good reason to believe that they cannot - OIF should not be considered a viable technology for climate mitigation.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","2008.373","selected",""

"Proposing a potential strategy concerning Mineral-enhanced Biological Pump (MeBP) for improving Ocean Iron Fertilization (OIF)","Yuan, Peng and Liu, Dong","2021","Applied Clay Science","Ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is a geoengineering strategy aimed at mitigating global warming by reducing the amount of atmospheric CO2. However, the efficacy by which OIF vertically exports organic carbon of bloomed phytoplankton (mostly, diatoms) to the deep sea is low because of the remineralization of organic carbon during the sinking of diatomaceous silica (BSi). To address the low efficiency of the vertical C export of OIF, a potential strategy for enhancing oceanic biological pump using clay minerals, so-called mineral-enhanced biological pump (MeBP), is proposed herein. Under ideal operation of MeBP, the purposefully added clay minerals are supposed to agglomerate with BSi, facilitating an increase in the quantity of BSi settling and a decrease of organic carbon loss. Meanwhile, the structural Al of clay minerals would be assimilated by diatoms due to the biological dissolution of the clays, inhibiting the dissolution of BSi during its sinking. The abovementioned effects would significantly improve the efficiency of the vertical C export of OIF. The preliminary evidence and arguments in support of MeBP are presented.","Chemistry; Materials Science; Mineralogy","2021.289","selected",""
"Methods for greenhouse gas offset accounting: A case study of ocean iron fertilization","Rickels, W. and Rehdanz, K. and Oschlies, A.","2010","Ecological Economics","Reducing atmospheric carbon concentration by removing past emissions can extend our rapidly diminishing emission budgets corresponding to the target of limiting the temperature increase to 2 Â°C above preindustrial levels. Forestation measures to offset carbon emissions have already entered the Kyoto Protocol. Other carbon offset options like ocean iron fertilization or chemically enhanced weathering are currently being analyzed. The analysis and comparison of such options requires determination of the amount of carbon credits generated that can be used for compliance. In our analysis we assess the impact of various accounting methods applied to large-scale sink enhancement projects, taking into account the partly temporary storage characteristics arising from such projects. We apply the various accounting methods to hypothetical large-scale Southern Ocean iron fertilization projects for different durations. From an economic perspective, issuing temporary carbon credits would provide the largest number of carbon credits at an early stage. This is equivalent to the existing tCER regulation under the Kyoto Protocol. Issuing temporary carbon credits for short-term ocean iron fertilization would also benefit the environment, as all credits would have to be replaced in the next commitment period. As some carbon will be stored permanently, this reduces atmospheric carbon concentration. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.",NA,"2010.860","selected",""
"Evaluation of the sinks and sources of atmospheric CO2 by artificial upwelling","Pan, Y. and Fan, W. and Huang, T.-H. and Wang, S.-L. and Chen, C.-T.A.","2015","Science Of The Total Environment","Artificial upwelling is considered a promising way to reduce the accumulation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This practice could transport nutrient-rich deep water to the euphotic zone, enhance phytoplankton growth and consequently increase organic carbon exportation to the deep ocean via the biological pump. However, only a few studies quantitatively assess changes in oceanic CO2 uptake resulting from artificial upwelling. This article uses a simulation to examine the effect of hypothetical artificial upwelling-induced variations of CO2 fugacity in seawater (fCO2) using observed carbon and nutrient data from 14 stations, ranging from 21 to 43Â°N, in the West Philippine Sea (WPS), the East China Sea (ECS) and the Sea of Japan. Calculations are based on two basic assumptions: First, a near-field mixing of a nutrient-rich deep-ocean water plume in a stratified ocean environment is assumed to form given the presence of an artificial upwelling devise with appropriate technical parameters. Second, it is assumed that photosynthesis of marine phytoplankton could deplete all available nutrients following the stoichiometry of the modified Redfield ratio C/H/O/N/S/P=103.1/181.7/93.4/11.7/2.1/1. Results suggest artificial upwelling has significant effects on regional changes in sea-air differences (Î´fCO2sea-air) and the carbon sequestration potential (Î´fCO2mixed-amb). Large variations of Î´fCO2sea-air and Î´fCO2mixed-amb are shown to be associated with different regions, seasons and technical parameters of the artificial upwelling device. With proper design, it is possible to reverse the contribution of artificial upwelling from a strong CO2 source to sink. Thus, artificial upwelling has the potential to succeed as a geoengineering technique to sequester anthropogenic CO2, with appropriate technical parameters in the right region and season.
