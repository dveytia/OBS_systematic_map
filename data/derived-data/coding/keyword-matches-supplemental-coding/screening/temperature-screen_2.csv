"Large-scale interventions may delay decline of the Great Barrier Reef","Condie, Scott A. and Anthony, Kenneth R. N. and Babcock, Russ C. and Baird, Mark E. and Beeden, Roger and Fletcher, Cameron S. and Gorton, Rebecca and Harrison, Daniel and Hobday, Alistair J. and Plaganyi, Eva E. and Westcott, David A.","2021","Royal Society Open Science","On the iconic Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the cumulative impacts of tropical cyclones, marine heatwaves and regular outbreaks of coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS) have severely depleted coral cover. Climate change will further exacerbate this situation over the coming decades unless effective interventions are implemented. Evaluating the efficacy of alternative interventions in a complex system experiencing major cumulative impacts can only be achieved through a systems modelling approach. We have evaluated combinations of interventions using a coral reef meta-community model. The model consisted of a dynamic network of 3753 reefs supporting communities of corals and CoTS connected through ocean larval dispersal, and exposed to changing regimes of tropical cyclones, flood plumes, marine heatwaves and ocean acidification. Interventions included reducing flood plume impacts, expanding control of CoTS populations, stabilizing coral rubble, managing solar radiation and introducing heat-tolerant coral strains. Without intervention, all climate scenarios resulted in precipitous declines in GBR coral cover over the next 50 years. The most effective strategies in delaying decline were combinations that protected coral from both predation (CoTS control) and thermal stress (solar radiation management) deployed at large scale. Successful implementation could expand opportunities for climate action, natural adaptation and socioeconomic adjustment by at least one to two decades.","Science \& Technology - Other Topics","2021.1144","selected",""
"Well integrity for CO2 injection from ships: Simulation of the effect of flow and material parameters on thermal stresses","Aursand, P. and Hammer, M. and Lavrov, A. and Lund, H. and Munkejord, S.T. and TorsÃ¦ter, M.","2017","International Journal Of Greenhouse Gas Control","Ships have been shown to be the most cost-effective way to transport CO2 from many sources in the Nordic region to offshore storage sites. Injection from ships introduces new challenges for the integrity of CO2 injection wells. The low temperature and the intermittency of CO2 injected from ships give rise to large temperature variations in the well. Such variations may lead to thermal stresses that exceed the limits of the well construction method and materials. In this paper we present a coupled flow and heat conduction model for CO2 wells. The model is used to conduct a parameter study and determine the parametersâ€™ effect on the temperature variations in the well during injection from ships. The parameters varied are injection rate, injection time, injection temperature and time between injections. The resulting temperature variations are used as input for a 2D thermoelastic finite-element model in ABAQUS to determine the thermal stresses. Our results show that the amplitude of temperature variations downhole is mainly increased by longer pauses between injections, and by lower injection temperature. In the worst-case scenario considered in this paper, the thermal stresses may be large enough to induce debonding at the casingâ€“cement interface. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",NA,"2017.14740","selected",""

"Loss and Damage Estimation for Extreme Weather Events: State of the Practice","Doktycz, Charles and Abkowitz, Mark","2019","Sustainability","Extreme weather, climate-induced events that are episodic (e.g., hurricane, heatwave) or chronic (e.g., sea-level rise, temperature change) in nature, is occurring with increasing frequency and severity. This places a growing and time-sensitive need on the development and implementation of adaptation policies and practices. To motivate adaptive behavior, however, requires the ability to deliver improved risk-informed decision-making capability. At the crux of this challenge is the provision of full and accurate loss and damage accounting of the overall impact of an extreme weather event, enabling the business case to be made for adaptation investment. We define loss and damage as the manifestation of impacts associated with extreme weather that negatively affect human and natural systems. Progress in the development of adequate loss and damage accounting has been hampered by issues, such as discrepancies in conceptual frameworks, problems associated with data quantity and quality, and lack of standardized analysis methodologies. In this paper, we have discussed the conceptual basis for measuring loss and damage, reviewed the state of loss and damage data collection and modeling, and offered a narrative on the future direction of the practice.","Science \& Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2019.93",NA,""

Strategies for acute events included development and implementation of programs and practices for monitoring and treating mental health problems and strengthening individual and community resilience, training of community health workers to deliver services, and conducting inventories of available resources and assessments of at-risk populations. Additional strategies for sub-acute changes included advocacy for mitigation policies and programs and adaptation of guidelines and interventions to address the secondary impacts of sub-acute events, such as threats to livelihood, health and well-being, population displacement, environmental degradation, and civil conflict. Strategies for long-lasting changes included the implementation of evidence-based risk communication interventions that address the existing and potential threat of climate change, promoting the mental health benefits of environmental conservation, and promoting psychological growth and resilience.

"Asymmetrical Reactive Power Capability of Modular Multilevel Cascade Converter Based STATCOMs for Offshore Wind Farm","Tanaka, T. and Ma, K. and Wang, H. and Blaabjerg, F.","2019","Ieee Transactions On Power Electronics","Modular multilevel cascade converters (MMCCs) are becoming attractive solutions as high-voltage Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs) for power plants in renewable energy generation, in order to satisfy the strict grid codes under both normal and grid fault conditions. This paper investigates the performances of four potentially used configurations of the MMCC family for the STATCOM in large-scale offshore wind power plants, with special focus on asymmetrical low-voltage ride through capability under grid faults. The specifications and the sizing of components of each type of practical 80-MVar/33-kV-scaled MMCC-STATCOM are carefully designed and compared. The total cost and volume are compared based on the total power semiconductor chip area and the total energy stored in the passive components. Asymmetrical reactive power delivering operation of the MMCC family considering the dc-link capacitor voltage-balancing method is solved mathematically in order to quantitatively understand the performance limitations and behaviors. The electrothermal stress of the power modules used in each type of the MMCC for a practical 80-MVar/33-kV-scaled STATCOM is analyzed. The asymmetrical reactive power capability of the MMCC solutions is compared under different scenarios of grid faults, while considering the device temperature limits as well as voltage saturation. It is found that the MMCC configuration with double-star bridge cells becomes the most attractive circuit configuration for the STATCOM application based on the obtained results.

Hole Enlargement portrays an area of concern by multiple oil & gas operators due to the challenging nature of enlarging a hole that subjects the tool & string members to aggressive dynamic vibrations especially when combined with thermal stresses and unpredictable lithology. Methods, Procedures, Process: While drilling a challenging deep development well in Kuwait, the drilling engineers considered enlarging a 2,000 ft 6 inch horizontal interval to 7 inch (17% beyond the bit diameter) to facilitate 5 inch liner being run to TD & mitigate restrictions which have resulted in significant NPT due to a 50% shale & 50% lime stone unstable interval. Drilling that section has encountered multiple issues associated with the high downhole temperature in terms of directional drilling motor failures costing the operator 4 tripping cycles to replace failed tools. Results, Observations, and Conclusions: Defining a hole enlargement operation using a hydraulically actuated underreamer in such challenging well was supported through an extensive application engineering feasibility study from both the service provider and operator, initiating from an operational risk assessment, hydraulic optimization simulations to ensure maximum cooling and cutting delivery efficiency, Torque & Drag analysis, vibration and critical speed interpretation, stuck pipe simulations to effectively analyze jar placement performance. The underreamer was successfully operated in downhole temperatures exceeding 300 degrees Fahrenheit and the 2000 ft interval was enlarged in 2 trips. Additional PDC cutting structure work-rate modeling was utilized to optimize the positioning of the PDC cutters for an enhanced cutting efficiency in addition to real time field support that provides drilling parameter recommendations for weight on reamer, RPM, & ROP for the entire interval to mitigate additional trips and improve drilling efficiency. Novel/Additive Information: Enhancing drilling efficiency while managing NPT was the defined objectives for both parties while initially designing a hole enlargement application engineering package. This was successfully implemented and saved the operator 3 days of rig time on the planned drilling time. Â© 2016, Offshore Technology Conference",NA,"2016.14886",NA,""
"Warming Seas in the Coral Triangle: Coral Reef Vulnerability and Management Implications","McLeod, Elizabeth and Moffitt, Russell and Timmermann, Axel and Salm, Rodney and Menviel, Laurie and Palmer, Michael J. and Selig, Elizabeth R. and Casey, Kenneth S. and Bruno, John F.","2010","Coastal Management","The highest diversity coral reefs in the world, located in the Coral Triangle, are threatened by a variety of local stresses including pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing in addition to climate change impacts, such as increasing sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and ocean acidification. As climate change impacts increase, coral reef vulnerability at the ecoregional scale will have an increasingly important influence on conservation management decisions. This project provides the first detailed assessment of past and future climatic stress, thermal variability, and anthropogenic impacts in the Coral Triangle at the ecoregional level, thus incorporating both local (e.g., pollution, development, and overfishing) and global threats (increasing SSTs). The development of marine protected area (MPA) networks across the Coral Triangle is critical for the region to address these threats. Specific management recommendations are defined for MPA networks based on the levels of vulnerability to thermal and local stress. For example, coral reef regions with potentially low vulnerability to thermal stress may be priorities for establishment of MPA networks, whereas high vulnerability regions may require selection and design principles aimed at building resilience to climate change. The identification of climate and other human threats to coral reef systems and ecoregions can help conservation practitioners prioritize management responses to address these threats and identify gaps in MPA networks or other management mechanisms (e. g., integrated coastal management).","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2010.5352","selected",""
"Delivering Safe, Cost-Effective, Sustainable Civil Infrastructure Projects under Conditions of Non-Stationarity","Wallace, Bill and Ellison, Dave and Daugherty, Ryan","2017","NANA","This paper proposes, describes and diagrams a methodology for planning, designing, constructing, and operating civil infrastructure projects for an operating environment that is changing substantially and in ways that are not readily predictable. Its purpose is to offer a timely answer to the engineer's follow-on question, ``How do I deliver a safe, reliable and costeffective infrastructure project in the face of these significant changes?{''} An extension of existing civil infrastructure project delivery practices, this methodology addresses these changing conditions by incorporating appropriate levels of robustness, resilience, redundancy, and adaptability into the project design. Global climate change, the result of the burning of fossil fuels, is altering significantly the statistical properties of the environmental design parameters engineers use in infrastructure design. Consequently, long-held design assumptions such as ambient temperatures, sea levels, storm intensity, and the likely extent of droughts and heat waves are no longer reliable. Unknowingly, today's engineers are planning, designing, and constructing infrastructure projects that will not be able to cope with future operating conditions. Thus, it is critical that the engineering profession devise a way of delivering projects that accounts for these new and significantly changing environmental conditions. Adopting this or some modification to this methodology is essential if civil infrastructure projects are to function as specified, and be protective of public health, safety, and well-being.","Science \& Technology - Other Topics; Engineering","2017.10182",NA,""

"Diamond in the rough: Pursuing disaster justice in Surat, India","Verchick, Robert R. M.","2018","Environment And Planning E-nature And Space","Perhaps no country in the world is as vulnerable on so many fronts to climate change as India. With 7000 kilometers of coastline, the vast Himalayan glaciers, and nearly 70 million hectares of forests, India is especially vulnerable to warmer temperatures, erratic precipitation, higher seas, and swifter storms. Then there are India's cities, where all of these trends threaten public health and safety on a grand scale-portending heat waves, drought, thicker smog, coastal storms, and blown-out sewers. Yet, my travels on the subcontinent revealed glints of hope, cities thrown on the ropes by climate change, but effectively fighting back. One is Surat-India's bustling, no-nonsense city, near the Arabian Sea. There I spoke with city officials, business leaders, and public health experts. I perused the aeration basins of a water treatment plant, climbed the floodgates of a major river embankment, and threaded my way through a township built to replace a flood-prone slum. I even toured a diamond-polishing facility that turns out to be very relevant to this climate story. In sum, Surat is making impressive progress that other cities in the developing world can surely learn from. While the city seems poised for prosperity, its fortune depends on its ability to improve flood control, protect public health, and expand access to safe housing. Success in Surat requires disaster justice. Before entering the city, we will first examine the threat posed by climate change in the Global South and its relationship to disaster, along the way sorting out a series of justice-oriented concerns related to climate, disaster, and the environment. Because disaster justice emphasizes the role of unequal vulnerabilities among social groups, we will next consider the relationship between such social vulnerabilities and the concept of justice. We will see what other cities in the world might learn from India's Diamond Capital.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Geography","2018.7409",NA,""
"Survivors of Climate Driven Abalone Mass Mortality Exhibit Declines in Health and Reproduction Following Kelp Forest Collapse","Rogers-Bennett, Laura and Klamt, Robert and Catton, Cynthia A.","2021","Frontiers In Marine Science","Marine ecosystems are vulnerable to climate driven events such as marine heatwaves yet we have a poor understanding of whether they will collapse or recover. Kelp forests are known to be susceptible, and there has been a rise in sea urchin barrens around the world. When temperatures increase so do physiological demands while food resources decline, tightening metabolic constraints. In this case study, we examine red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) looking at sublethal impacts and their prospects for recovery within kelp forests that have shifted to sea urchin barrens. Abalone are a recreationally fished species that once thrived in northern California's bull kelp forests but have recently suffered mass mortalities since the 2014-2016 marine heatwave. Quantitative data exist on the health and reproduction of abalone both prior to and after the collapse. The survivors of the mass mortality show a 2-year lag in body and gonad condition indices. After the lag, body and gonad indexes decreased substantially, as did the relationship between shell length and body weight. Production of mature eggs per female declined by 99\% (p < 0.001), and the number of eggs per gram of female body weight (2,984/g) declined to near zero (9/g). The number of males with sperm was reduced by 33\%, and the sperm abundance score was reduced by 28\% (p = 0.414). We observed that these reductions were for mature eggs and sperm while immature eggs and spermatids were still present in large numbers. In the lab, after reintroduction of kelp, weight gains were quickly lost following a second starvation period. This example illustrates how climate-driven declines in foundation species can suppress recovery of the system by impacting body condition and future reproduction of surviving individuals. Given the poor reproductive potential of the remaining abalone in northern California, coupled with ongoing mortality and low kelp abundances, we discuss the need to maintain the fishing moratorium and implement active abalone restoration measures. For fished species, such as abalone, this additional hurdle to recovery imposed by changes in climate is critical to understand and incorporate into resource management and restoration.</p>","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2021.8401","excluded",""

In this work we describe an aquaculture focused environmental monitoring network consisting of LoRaWAN-enabled atmospheric and marine sensors attached to buoys on Clyde River, located on the South Coast of New South Wales, Australia. This sensor network provides oyster farmers operating on the river with the capacity to make informed, accurate and rapid decisions that enhance their ability to respond to adverse environmental events-typically flooding and heat waves. The system represents an end-to-end approach that involves deploying a sensor network, analysing the data, creating visualisations in collaboration with farmers and delivering them to them in real-time via a website known as FarmDecisionTECH (R). We compared this network with previously available infrastructure, the results of which demonstrate that an in situ weather station was \& SIM;5 \& LCIRC;C hotter than the closest available real-time weather station (\& SIM;20 km away from Clyde River) during a summertime heat wave. Heat waves can result in oysters dying due to exposure if temperatures rise above 30 \& LCIRC;C for extended periods of time (such as heat waves), which will mean a loss in income for the farmers; thus, this work stresses the need for accurate in situ monitoring to prevent the loss of oysters through informed farm management practices. Finally, an approach is proposed to present high-dimensional datasets captured from the sensor network to oyster farmers in a clear and informative manner.","Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments \& Instrumentation","2021.13828","selected",""

The notion that adaptive traits can be retained by transferring the symbionts alone, however, challenges the holobiont concept, a fundamental paradigm in coral research. Holobiont traits are products of a specific community (holobiont) and all its co-evolutionary and local adaptations, which might limit the retention or transference of holobiont traits by exchanging only one partner. Here we evaluate how interchanging partners affect the short- and long-term performance of holobionts under heat stress using clonal lineages of the cnidarian model system Aiptasia (host and Symbiodiniaceae strains) originating from distinct thermal environments. Our results show that holobionts from more thermally variable environments have higher plasticity to heat stress, but this resilience could not be transferred to other host genotypes through the exchange of symbionts. Importantly, our findings highlight the role of the host in determining holobiont productivity in response to thermal stress and indicate that local adaptations of holobionts will likely limit the efficacy of interchanging unfamiliar compartments to enhance thermal tolerance.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2020.5567","selected",""
"Bleaching physiology: who's the `weakest link' - host vs. symbiont?","Roberty, Stephane and Plumier, Jean-Christophe","2022","Emerging Topics In Life Sciences","Environmental stress, such as an increase in the sea surface temperature, triggers coral bleaching, a profound dysfunction of the mutualist symbiosis between the host cnidarians and their photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the Family Symbiodiniaceae. Because of climate change, mass coral bleaching events will increase in frequency and severity in the future, threatening the persistence of this iconic marine ecosystem at global scale. Strategies adapted to coral reefs preservation and restoration may stem from the identification of the succession of events and of the different molecular and cellular contributors to the bleaching phenomenon. To date, studies aiming to decipher the cellular cascade leading to temperature-related bleaching, emphasized the involvement of reactive species originating from compromised bioenergetic pathways (e.g. cellular respiration and photosynthesis). These molecules are responsible for damage to various cellular components causing the dysregulation of cellular homeostasis and the breakdown of symbiosis. In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge available in the literature on the cellular mechanisms caused by thermal stress, which can initiate or participate in the cell cascade leading to the loss of symbionts, with a particular emphasis on the role of each partner in the initiating processes.","Biochemistry \& Molecular Biology; Life Sciences \& Biomedicine - Other Topics","2022.1319","excluded",""
"Environmental variability indicates a climate-adaptive center under threat in northern Mozambique coral reefs","McClanahan, Timothy R. and Muthiga, Nyawira A.","2017","Ecosphere","A priority for modern conservation is finding and managing regions with environmental and biodiversity portfolio characteristics that will promote adaptation and the persistence of species during times of rapid climate change. The latitudinal edges of high-diversity biomes are likely to provide a mixture of environmental gradients and biological diversity that meet the portfolio criteria needed for adaptive systems. Northern Mozambique and the Quirimbas Islands represent the edge of a coral reef diversity center with limited potential to expand because of geologic and oceanographic limits on the southern edges. This region does, however, have the potential to be its own discrete adaptive center if it contains climate refugia and there are environmental gradients that promote acclimatization, ecological reorganization, and natural selection. Consequently, to evaluate this potential we tested for strong regional environmental spatial heterogeneity that might indicate a climate-adaptive center. Additionally, we evaluated human influences and environmental and demographic data on finfish, coral, and sea urchins in 66 reefs across similar to 4 degrees of latitude to evaluate ecological changes and human threats. A number of clear gradients in environmental and human influences were observed. For example, temperature increased and became more centralized and right-skewed, while water quality decreased to the south. Coral communities susceptible to thermal stress were found in the north where dispersed temperatures indicated a location with either tolerance to or refugium from recent thermal disturbances. Nevertheless, high coral diversity was found in southern deep-water channels. Further, spatial patterns for corals and fish differed indicating complex geographic-fishing-biodiversity gradients. Consequently, environmental conditions for an adaptive portfolio exist and include refugia for preserving climate-sensitive and for numbers of coral taxa. Fishing and urban threats were observable as reduced fish biomass, diversity, and body sizes but higher biomass of sea urchins. We observed that many remote and protected areas had fish biomass values lower than expected or near maximum sustainable yields. This indicates low compliance and widespread migratory fishing, which is reducing fish diversity below maximum levels. Recommendations to sustain this adaptive center are to maintain fish biomass >500 kg/ha by increasing fisheries restrictions and compliance.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2017.8266","selected",""
"Temperature-driven coral decline: the role of marine protected areas","Selig, Elizabeth R. and Casey, Kenneth S. and Bruno, John F.","2012","Global Change Biology","Warming ocean temperatures are considered to be an important cause of the degradation of the world's coral reefs. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been proposed as one tool to increase coral reef ecosystem resistance and resilience (i.e. recovery) to the negative effects of climate change, yet few studies have evaluated their efficacy in achieving these goals. We used a high resolution 4 km global temperature anomaly database from 19852005 and 8040 live coral cover surveys on protected and unprotected reefs to determine whether or not MPAs have been effective in mitigating temperature-driven coral loss. Generally, protection in MPAs did not reduce the effect of warm temperature anomalies on coral cover declines. Shortcomings in MPA design, including size and placement, may have contributed to the lack of an MPA effect. Empirical studies suggest that corals that have been previously exposed to moderate levels of thermal stress have greater adaptive capacity and resistance to future thermal stress events. Existing MPAs protect relatively fewer reefs with moderate anomaly frequencies, potentially reducing their effectiveness. However, our results also suggest that the benefits from MPAs may not be great enough to offset the magnitude of losses from acute thermal stress events. Although MPAs are important conservation tools, their limitations in mitigating coral loss from acute thermal stress events suggest that they need to be complemented with policies aimed at reducing the activities responsible for climate change.","Biodiversity \& Conservation; Environmental Sciences \& Ecology","2012.5232","selected",""

Inspired by the â€˜oxidative stress theory of coral bleachingâ€™, we investigated whether a bacterial consortium designed to scavenge free radicals could integrate into the host microbiome and improve thermal tolerance of the coral model, Exaiptasia diaphana. Methods and Results: E. diaphana anemones were inoculated with a consortium of high free radical scavenging (FRS) bacteria, a consortium of congeneric low FRS bacteria, or sterile seawater as a control, then exposed to elevated temperature. Increases in the relative abundance of Labrenzia during the first 2Â weeks following the last inoculation provided evidence for temporary inoculum integration into the E. diaphana microbiome. Initial uptake of other consortium members was inconsistent, and these bacteria did not persist either in E. diaphanaâ€™s microbiome over time. Given their non-integration into the host microbiome, the ability of the FRS consortium to mitigate thermal stress could not be assessed. Importantly, there were no physiological impacts (negative or positive) of the bacterial inoculations on the holobiont. Conclusions: The introduced bacteria were not maintained in the anemone microbiome over time, thus, their protective effect is unknown. Achieving long-term integration of bacteria into cnidarian microbiomes remains a research priority. Significance and Impact of the Study: Microbiome engineering strategies to mitigate coral bleaching may assist coral reefs in their persistence until climate change has been curbed.
