"Photo-physiology and morphology reveal divergent warming responses in northern and southern hemisphere seagrasses","Hung Manh Nguyen and Bulleri, Fabio and Marin-Guirao, Lazaro and Pernice, Mathieu and Procaccini, Gabriele","2021","Marine Biology","A better understanding of species and population responses to thermal stress is critical to predict changes in their distribution under warming scenarios. Seagrasses are a unique group of marine plants that play fundamental roles in marine environments and provide vital ecosystem services. Nevertheless, previous studies on seagrass thermal tolerance have focused exclusively on a handful of species, with the majority of these remaining virtually unexplored. Moreover, to date, no study has compared the response to thermal stress between northern and southern hemisphere seagrasses. Here, we conducted comparative mesocosm experiments using four seagrass species from the northern (i.e. Mediterranean: Posidonia oceanica, Cymodocea nodosa) and southern (i.e. Australia: Posidonia australis and Zostera muelleri) hemisphere as representative of two different life strategies, i.e. climax (P. oceanica, P. australis) and pioneer (C. nodosa, Z. muelleri). Plants acclimatized to the mesocosm conditions at ambient temperature (i.e. 26 degrees C) during a 5-week period, were exposed to a simulated marine heatwave (i.e. 32 degrees C) for 2 weeks. Measurements of plant responses, including photo-physiology, morphology, and pigment content, were performed at the end of the warming exposure. Results showed that warming had no significant effects on photosynthetic performances of northern hemisphere seagrasses while negatively impacted their southern hemisphere counterparts. Similarly, warming favored the growth of northern hemisphere plants, but strongly inhibited the development of southern hemisphere species. Furthermore, photo-physiological and pigment content results suggested pioneer seagrasses better dealt with warming than climax species. Our study provides more insights into the field of seagrass ecology and yields potential implication for future seagrass conservation and restoration activities.","Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2021.6232",NA,""
"Thermal Stress Analysis of IGBT Modules in VSCs for PMSG in Large Offshore Wind Energy Conversion Systems","Pittini, Riccardo and D'Arco, Salvatore and Hernes, Magnar and Petterteig, Astrid","2011","NANA","Components for offshore wind farms are required to be highly reliable due to harsh environmental conditions and poor accessibility for maintenance. Direct-Drive Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) connected with back to back converters represents an attractive solution for large offshore Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECSs). Large direct driven Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) operate at lower speed compared to conventional geared WTs with operating frequencies that can be as low as 6-13 Hz (e. g. Enercon). The low operating frequencies introduce a continuous power cycling of the semiconductor devices and can lead to a reduced lifetime of the generator side converter. Accurate thermal models integrated with circuital simulations can assist in predicting these stresses and in analyzing countermeasures. This paper describes a method for thermal analysis of power converters based on a custom developed module in PSCAD/ETMDC that implements a thermal model running in parallel to the electrical simulations. The custom module calculates the power dissipation and the temperature of the devices based on their physical characteristics and on their operating conditions derived from the electrical simulation. The method is applied for the analysis of a Voltage Source Converter (VSC) connected to the PMSG in a Direct Drive WECS. The simulations prove that the worst operating condition for the generator side converter in the sample system examined is represented by the turbine generating at its rated power. The temperature swings over the power semiconductors at lower power and lower generator frequency induce a minor stress. However, the worst operating condition may not correspond to the rated power in other cases especially for Direct Drive PMSG-WTs with a relatively low number of poles.","Engineering","2011.8179",NA,""
"Depth Affects Seagrass Restoration Success and Resilience to Marine Heat Wave Disturbance","Aoki, Lillian R. and McGlathery, Karen J. and Wiberg, Patricia L. and Al-Haj, Alia","2020","Estuaries And Coasts","Accelerating losses of seagrass meadows motivate the restoration of these highly productive and beneficial ecosystems. Understanding how environmental parameters including depth and temperature affect restoration trajectories through time is key to conserving and restoring seagrass meadows. We used a long-term (12-year), landscape-scale experiment to test the effect of depth on eelgrass (Zostera marina) restoration success and resilience to a marine heat wave (MHW) disturbance. We found that depth was a critical determinant of seagrass restoration success, with no long-term success at sites deeper than 1.5 m below mean sea level (MSL) or shallower than - 0.8 m MSL. Seeds germinated below - 1.5 m MSL, but shoots did not persist, confirming earlier predictions from a hydrodynamic-vegetation model. Depth was also a significant predictor of seagrass resilience following MHW disturbance. Our results suggest that areas of restored seagrass that are resilient to temperature stress exist across an intermediate depth range, excluding the shallowest and deepest portions of the full habitable depth range for restored seagrass. Over the next decades, sea-level rise will likely affect both the habitable area and the resilient area, available for seagrass restoration. However, seagrass enhancement of sediment accretion may at least partially offset sea-level rise rates. As ocean temperatures warm and MHWs occur more frequently, the resilience of seagrass meadows to temperature stress will be of increasing concern. These results suggest that depth is a critical parameter that will help determine what areas are most resilient and therefore most suitable for conservation and restoration.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2020.14794","selected",""
"Adaptation to Climate Change","Bedsworth, Louise W. and Hanak, Ellen","2010","Journal Of The American Planning Association","Problem: Even if significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions are achieved, some amount of climate change appears to be inevitable. Local, regional, state, and federal planning and regulation should begin to address how to adapt to these changes. Purpose: This article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, using California as a case study. We examine the institutional and regulatory challenges and tradeoffs that climate change poses in six particularly vulnerable areas: water resources, electricity, coastal resources, air quality, public health, and ecosystem resources. We discuss obstacles to adaptation planning and successes overcoming these barriers, and suggest how planning can incorporate adaptation. Methods: This article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, drawing on our recent research on California's experience and related literature. We summarize the results of six studies that draw on quantitative and qualitative information gathered through surveys, interviews, and literature review. Results and conclusions: Planners should use forward-looking climate data that include higher water and air temperatures, sea-level rise, and increased numbers of extreme events like heat waves, floods, and wildfires when making decisions about future development, infrastructure investments, open-space protection, and disaster preparedness. Climate change will exacerbate conflicts between goals for economic development, habitat protection, and public safety, requiring stronger interagency coordination and new laws and regulations. Takeaway for practice: Local and regional planners can help society adapt to a changing climate by using the best available science, deciding on goals and early actions, locating relevant partners, identifying and eliminating regulatory barriers, and encouraging the introduction of new state mandates and guidelines.

"Cost optimized dynamic design of offshore windfarm transformers with reliability and contingency considerations","Kazmi, S.H.H. and Laneryd, T. and Giannikas, K. and Ahrenfeldt, S.F. and SÃ¸rensen, T.S. and Olesen, T.H. and HolbÃ¸ll, J.","2021","International Journal Of Electrical Power And Energy Systems","Application of Dynamic Thermal Rating (DTR) for optimal utilization of transmission system components has been addressed in several studies. For Offshore Wind Power Plants (OWPPs), as a consequence of intermittent wind generation combined with favorable ambient conditions and strict design regulations, power transformers tend to be over-dimensioned. Experience suggests that transformer lifetime exceeds OWPP life by tens of years, therefore DTR-based design of transformers can facilitate the optimization of OWPP export system. The recent breakthroughs in Thermo-Electric Equivalent (TEE) and aging models of transformers suggest that temporal development of Top Oil (TOT) and Hot Spot (HST) temperatures can be calculated efficiently, which when combined with monitoring of moisture and oxygen development can accurately assess the transformer health in real-time using Degree of Polymerization (DP). However, the economic optimization of offshore windfarms substations using DTR and lifetime utilization-based transformer design during the OWPP planning phase has not been addressed in the literature due to the risks involved in balancing system reliability with windfarm profitability. In this paper, a novel strategy is proposed to utilize transformer DTR for cost optimization of offshore windfarm export system during the OWPP design phase. Net Present Value (NPV) is used to assess capital cost impacts on transformer and Offshore Substation (OSS) design in year 0, and yearly revenue change over OWPP lifetime due to increased losses and possible energy curtailment as a result of smaller transformers. The unique methodology accounts for varying wind turbine availability due to maintenance and concurs with OWPP design requirements for OSS transformer contingency by generating statistical scenarios based on distribution functions and Markov Chain (MC) models respectively. Moreover, the MC models are adapted for two fundamentally different design concepts for OWPP export system: n-1 contingent and non-contingent. The implementation of probabilistic Markov models to resolve stressful periods with increased transformer loading is distinctive to this paper and offers a unique perspective for DTR-based transformer size optimization. Long-term site assessment data for OWPP including historical wind generation is used for transformer thermal assessment (TOT and HST) based on its load and ambient conditions. Furthermore, the reliability of design for varying construction and commissioning conditions is ensured by tracking DP-based transformer lifetime utilization over the operation period for three scenarios of oxygen and moisture development: conservative, high moisture and high oxygen. The case study of a 1200 MW offshore windfarm with two 220 kV parallel export circuits and four 33/220 kV transformers in one OSS located 50 km off the east coast of UK has been used in this paper. 100 scenarios of wind turbine availability and transformer contingency are simulated and the optimal design is determined for the worst-case scenario. Results indicate that optimal transformer rating can result in high thermal stress and minor energy curtailment during extreme contingency conditions for both the design concepts. However, the reduction in transformer size to align with OWPP operation life can reliably improve the windfarm business case significantly, particularly for the n-1 contingent design concept with conservative transformer moisture and oxygen conditions.

"Technology requirements, and social impacts of technology for at-scale coral reef restoration","Gibbs, Mark T.","2021","Technology In Society","The coral reefs of the world are in decline as a result of local and global stressors. Significant impacts are caused by ocean heat waves associated with increasing ocean temperatures as the oceans accommodate more and more of the heat produced as a result of the global emissions of greenhouse gases. In response, a global reef restoration sector is emerging with the aspiration to restore many of the worlds' reefs and increase their resilience to climate change and other stressors. However, the scale of the challenge is vast, and will realistically only be achieved through the development and application of new marine technology including for environmental surveillance and monitoring, material transfer (corals and coral rubble), new more resilient varieties of corals and the underpinning required data analytics. In addition, most reefs are located in low-income nations, including Small Island Nations and the level of complexity and ease of use of technologies being developed will dictate who can participate in at-scale restoration of the world's reefs, and correspondingly may lead to considerable social distributional impacts as some communities will be able to utilise emerging technologies whilst others may not.","Social Issues; Social Sciences - Other Topics","2021.16072","selected",""

"Effects of fragmented mangroves on macrozoobenthos: a case study of mangrove clearance for powerline right-of-way at Oproama Creek, Niger Delta, Nigeria","Zabbey, N. and Ekpenyong, I. G. and Nwipie, G. N. and Davies, I. C. and Sam, K.","2021","African Journal Of Aquatic Science","Mangroves are vulnerable to varying magnitudes of degrading impact by human activities. Despite the many benefits of mangrove ecosystems, mangroves in the Niger Delta region are often cleared for electric powerline and oil pipeline rights-of-way, recreation, road construction, housing and farming. The study assessed the impacts of mangrove clearance on physico-chemical parameters of interstitial water and macrozoobenthic primary community structure in Oproama Creek, Nigeria, from February to July 2016. Three stations were selected for the study: two stations in more natural and undisturbed mangroves and one station at a mangrove clearing (for a national grid powerline right-of-way). Species richness and diversity were slightly higher at the undisturbed mangrove sites than the cleared site. Removal of mangrove canopy shade alters microclimate temperature regime and other temperature-dependent parameters, imposing thermal stress on stenothermal taxa and ancillary stressors that compositely affected primary community structure indices. Deliberate loss of mangroves through clearing waterfront vegetation as a driver for improved visual monitoring and enhanced security in the Oproama Community in the Niger Delta is reported for the first time. The wider implications of mangrove clearance and fragmentation on ecosystem-based goods and services are discussed. Limiting mangrove spatial loss owing to construction of an electric tower cutline within coastal landscape is strongly recommended.","Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2021.2697","excluded",""
"Seagrass Recovery Following Marine Heat Wave Influences Sediment Carbon Stocks","Aoki, Lillian R. and McGlathery, Karen J. and Wiberg, Patricia L. and Oreska, Matthew P. J. and Berger, Amelie C. and Berg, Peter and Orth, Robert J.","2021","Frontiers In Marine Science","Worldwide, seagrass meadows accumulate significant stocks of organic carbon (C), known as ``blue{''} carbon, which can remain buried for decades to centuries. However, when seagrass meadows are disturbed, these C stocks may be remineralized, leading to significant CO2 emissions. Increasing ocean temperatures, and increasing frequency and severity of heat waves, threaten seagrass meadows and their sediment blue C. To date, no study has directly measured the impact of seagrass declines from high temperatures on sediment C stocks. Here, we use a long-term record of sediment C stocks from a 7-km2, restored eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadow to show that seagrass dieback following a single marine heat wave (MHW) led to significant losses of sediment C. Patterns of sediment C loss and re-accumulation lagged patterns of seagrass recovery. Sediment C losses were concentrated within the central area of the meadow, where sites experienced extreme shoot density declines of 90\% during the MHW and net losses of 20\% of sediment C over the following 3 years. However, this effect was not uniform; outer meadow sites showed little evidence of shoot declines during the MHW and had net increases of 60\% of sediment C over the following 3 years. Overall, sites with higher seagrass recovery maintained 1.7x as much C compared to sites with lower recovery. Our study demonstrates that while seagrass blue C is vulnerable to MHWs, localization of seagrass loss can prevent meadow-wide C losses. Long-term (decadal and beyond) stability of seagrass blue C depends on seagrass resilience to short-term disturbance events.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2021.2318","selected",""

South-eastern Australia is the focus of restoring the once abundant oyster Ostrea angasi. This region is also a climate change `hot spot' where the ocean is warming rapidly, with the potential to be exacerbated by marine heatwaves and coastal acidification. In this study, the impact of near-future (similar to 2050) elevated temperature and pCO(2) on O. angasi was determined and considered in context with concerns for the long-term sustainability of oyster reef restoration efforts. Oysters were exposed to ambient and elevated pCO(2) concentrations (mean +/- SE: 408 +/- 19.8 and 1070 +/- 53.4 mu atm) and ambient and elevated temperatures (22.78 +/- 0.17 and 25.73 +/- 0.21 degrees C) for 10 wk in outdoor flow-through mesocosms. Shell growth, condition index, standard metabolic rate (SMR), extracellular pH and survival were measured. Elevated temperature caused high mortality (36 \%) and decreased the condition of oysters (33 \%). Elevated pCO(2) increased SMR almost 4-fold and lowered the extracellular pH of O. angasi by a mean 0.29 pH units. In combination, elevated pCO(2) and temperature ameliorated effects on SMR and survivorship of oysters. O. angasi appears to be living near the limits of its thermal tolerance. Restoration projects will need to account for the temperature sensitivity of this species and its changing habitat to `climate proof' long-term restoration efforts.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","2019.3721","selected",""

Moreover, western countries increasingly recognize macroalgae, traditionally cultivated in Asia, as targets for a new bio-economy that can be both economically profitable and environmentally sustainable. However, seagrass meadows and macroalgal forests are threatened by a variety of anthropogenic stressors. Most notably, rising temperatures and marine heatwaves are already devastating these ecosystems around the globe, and are likely to compromise profitability and production security of macroalgal farming in the near future. Recent studies show that seagrass and macroalgae can become less susceptible to heat events once they have been primed with heat stress. Priming is a common technique in crop agriculture in which plants acquire a stress memory that enhances performance under a second stress exposure. Molecular mechanisms underlying thermal priming are likely to include epigenetic mechanisms that switch state and permanently trigger stress-preventive genes after the first stress exposure. Priming may have considerable potential for both ecosystem restoration and macroalgae farming to immediately improve performance and stress resistance and, thus, to enhance restoration success and production security under environmental challenges. However, priming methodology cannot be simply transferred from terrestrial crops to marine macrophytes. We present first insights into the formation of stress memories in both seagrasses and macroalgae, and research gaps that need to be filled before priming can be established as new bio-engineering technique in these ecologically and economically important marine primary producers.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","2021.4184","selected",""

"Conservation Planning for Coral Reefs Accounting for Climate Warming Disturbances","Magris, Rafael A. and Heron, Scott F. and Pressey, Robert L.","2015","Plos One","Incorporating warming disturbances into the design of marine protected areas (MPAs) is fundamental to developing appropriate conservation actions that confer coral reef resilience. We propose an MPA design approach that includes spatially-and temporally-varying sea-surface temperature (SST) data, integrating both observed (1985-2009) and projected (2010-2099) time-series. We derived indices of acute (time under reduced ecosystem function following short-term events) and chronic thermal stress (rate of warming) and combined them to delineate thermal-stress regimes. Coral reefs located on the Brazilian coast were used as a case study because they are considered a conservation priority in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. We show that all coral reef areas in Brazil have experienced and are projected to continue to experience chronic warming, while acute events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity. We formulated quantitative conservation objectives for regimes of thermal stress. Based on these objectives, we then evaluated if/how they are achieved in existing Brazilian MPAs and identified priority areas where additional protection would reinforce resilience. Our results show that, although the current system of MPAs incorporates locations within some of our thermal-stress regimes, historical and future thermal refugia along the central coast are completely unprotected. Our approach is applicable to other marine ecosystems and adds to previous marine planning for climate change in two ways: (i) by demonstrating how to spatially configure MPAs that meet conservation objectives for warming disturbance using spatially-and temporally-explicit data; and (ii) by strategically allocating different forms of spatial management (MPA types) intended to mitigate warming impacts and also enhance future resistance to climate warming.","Science \& Technology - Other Topics","2015.651","selected",""

H.","2013","Bmc Genetics","Background: Knowledge of genetic markers that are correlated to stress tolerance may improve spatial mapping of reef vulnerability and can inform restoration efforts, including the choice of genotypes for breeding and reseeding. In this manuscript we present two methods for screening transcriptome data for candidate genetic markers in two reef building corals, Acropora millepora and Pocillopora damicornis (types alpha and beta). In A. millepora, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were pre-selected by targeting genes believed to be involved in the coral thermal stress responses. In P. damicornis (type alpha and beta), SNPs showing varying allele frequencies between two populations from distinct environments were pre-selected. Allele frequencies at nine, five and eight of the pre-selected SNP loci were correlated against gradients of water clarity and temperature in a large number of populations along the Great Barrier Reef. Results: A significant correlation between environmental category and SNP allele frequency was detected in up to 55\% of the tested loci, which is an exceptional success rate for these types of tests. In P. damicornis, SNP allele frequencies of beta-hexosaminidase and Elongation factor 1-alpha were significantly correlated to temperature in type a and to temperature and/or water clarity respectively in type beta. Type alpha also showed a correlation between water clarity and SNP allele frequency in a gene of unknown function. In A. millepora, allele frequencies at five (beta-gamma crystallin, Galaxin, Ubiquitin, Ligand of Numb X2 and Thioredoxin) SNP loci showed significant correlations. Conclusions: After validation of these candidate loci through laboratory or field assessment of relative stress tolerance of colonies harbouring different alleles, it is anticipated that a proportion of these markers may represent the first coral candidate Quantitative Trait Loci for environmental stress tolerance and provide an important genetic tool that can be incorporated into spatial management decisions and restoration efforts of coral reefs. One pertinent example would be to combine spatial data of tolerant populations with genetic connectivity and thus identify high priority conservation reefs and implement targeted coral husbandry and active restoration efforts that use locally-and stress-adapted genotypes.","Genetics \& Heredity","2013.6633","selected",""
"Diminishing Opportunities for Sustainability of Coastal Cities in the Anthropocene: A Review","Day, J.W. and Gunn, J.D. and Burger, J.R.","2021","Frontiers In Environmental Science","The world is urbanizing most rapidly in tropical to sub-temperate areas and in coastal zones. Climate change along with other global change forcings will diminish the opportunities for sustainability of cities, especially in coastal areas in low-income countries. Climate forcings include global temperature and heatwave increases that are expanding the equatorial tropical belt, sea-level rise, an increase in the frequency of the most intense tropical cyclones, both increases and decreases in freshwater inputs to coastal zones, and increasingly severe extreme precipitation events, droughts, freshwater shortages, heat waves, and wildfires. Current climate impacts are already strongly influencing natural and human systems. Because of proximity to several key warming variables such as sea-level rise and increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves, coastal cities are a leading indicator of what may occur worldwide. Climate change alone will diminish the sustainability and resilience of coastal cities, especially in the tropical-subtropical belt, but combined with other global changes, this suite of forcings represents an existential threat, especially for coastal cities. Urbanization has coincided with orders of magnitude increases in per capita GDP, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn has led to unprecedented demand for natural resources and degradation of natural systems and more expensive infrastructure to sustain the flows of these resources. Most resources to fuel cities are extracted from ex-urban areas far away from their point of final use. The urban transition over the last 200Â years is a hallmark of the Anthropocene coinciding with large surges in use of energy, principally fossil fuels, population, consumption and economic growth, and environmental impacts such as natural system degradation and climate change. Fossil energy enabled and underwrote Anthropocene origins and fueled the dramatic expansion of modern urban systems. It will be difficult for renewable energy and other non-fossil energy sources to ramp up fast enough to fuel further urban growth and maintenance and reverse climate change all the while minimizing further environmental degradation. Given these trajectories, the future sustainability of cities and urbanization trends, especially in threatened areas like coastal zones in low-income countries in the tropical to sub-tropical belt, will likely diminish.

We use a systematic review approach to identify a global data set of 301 reported adaptation responses (remaining, adaptive, and transformative) of small-scale fishers to climate change and analyse their spatial agreement with estimated geographical location of global coastal hotspot areas for specific climate change hazards associated to those responses (long-term trends in sea surface temperature, cumulative intensity of marine heatwaves, frequency of tropical storms, and intensity of associated storm surges). Only 37\% of responses were found in climate change hotspots. Despite this, our results evidence that fishers are responding more passively in areas with lower exposure levels to abrupt climatic events. The relative proportion of adaptive and transformative responses increase with climate change hazard exposure. Small-scale fishers exhibit more active adaptive and transformative responses in areas with higher exposure levels to climate change hazards, according to a global systematic review approach of social-ecological systems.","Environmental Sciences \& Ecology; Geology; Meteorology \& Atmospheric Sciences","2022.991",NA,""
