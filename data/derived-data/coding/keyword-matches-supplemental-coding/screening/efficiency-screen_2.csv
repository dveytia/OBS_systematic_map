Navigating within the Safe Operating Space with Carbon Capture On-Board,"Negri, Valentina and Charalambous, Margarita A. and Medrano-Garcia, Juan D. and Guillen-Gosalbez, Gonzalo",2022,Acs Sustainable Chemistry \& Engineering,"Despite the global pandemic that recently affected human and cargo transportation, the emissions of the maritime sector are projected to keep growing steadily. The International Maritime Organization focused on boosting the fleets' efficiency to improve their environmental performance, while more sustainable fuels are currently under investigation. Here, we assess the economic, technical, and environmental feasibility of an interim solution for low-carbon shipping using state-of-the-art CO2 capture technology, namely, chemical absorption, on-board cargo ships. We compute the carbon footprint of this alternative and perform an absolute sustainability study based on seven planetary boundaries. Our results show that the capture on-board scenario can achieve 94\% efficiency on the net CO2 emissions at 85 \$/tCO2 while substantially reducing impacts on core planetary boundaries (relative to the business as usual) and outperforming a direct air capture scenario in global warming and all planetary boundaries, except for the nitrogen flow. Hence, capture on -board seems an appealing solution to decarbonize shipping in the short term while alternative carbon-free fuels and related infrastructure are developed and deployed.",Chemistry; Science \& Technology - Other Topics; Engineering,2022.2014,selected,
Sustainable Hybrid Marine Power Systems for Power Management Optimisation: A Review,"Roslan, S.B. and Konovessis, D. and Tay, Z.Y.",2022,Energies,"The increasing environmental concerns due to emissions from the shipping industry have accelerated the interest in developing sustainable energy sources and alternatives to traditional hydrocarbon fuel sources to reduce carbon emissions. Predominantly, a hybrid power system is used via a combination of alternative energy sources with hydrocarbon fuel due to the relatively small energy efficiency of the former as compared to the latter. For such a hybrid system to operate efficiently, the power management on the multiple power sources has to be optimised and the power requirements for different vessel types with varying loading operation profiles have to be understood. This can be achieved by using energy management systems (EMS) or power management systems (PMS) and control methods for hybrid marine power systems. This review paper focuses on the different EMSs and control strategies adopted to optimise power management as well as reduce fuel consumption and thus the carbon emission for hybrid vessel systems. This paper first presents the different commonly used hybrid propulsion systems, i.e., dieselâ€“mechanical, dieselâ€“electric, fully electric and other hybrid systems. Then, a comprehensive review of the different EMSs and control method strategies is carried out, followed by a comparison of the alternative energy sources to diesel power. Finally, the gaps, challenges and future works for hybrid systems are discussed. Â© 2022 by the authors.",NA,2022.275,selected,
Hybrid power and propulsion systems for ships: Current status and future challenges,"Inal, O.B. and Charpentier, J.-F. and Deniz, C.",2022,Renewable And Sustainable Energy Reviews,"Increasing environmental concerns are driving the shipping industry to take strict measures to deal with greenhouse gas emissions. International Maritime Organization drives the industry to find more efficient and environmentally friendly power systems. To mitigate harmful emissions, researches on marine alternative fuels, operational improvements like slow steaming or predictive maintenance, and additional emission abatement technologies are not sufficient. The use of electricity as the main energy vector is one of the ways to improve the shipping propulsion system's efficiency. In this study, power generation technologies, energy storage components, energy management systems, and hybrid propulsion topologies are reviewed. Diesel engines, fuel cells, solar and wind power as renewable energy sources are discussed as power generation units. On the energy storage side, batteries, supercapacitors, and flywheels are presented and described. Three common hybrid propulsion configurations, serial, parallel, and serial-parallel architectures are detailed with their pros and cons by highlighting commonly used energy management systems and optimization methods. Lastly, criteria for hybrid system selection are defined according to eight different ship types and assessed by providing a generic methodological approach. It is shown that electrical components and architectural design should be elaborated according to operational and architectural characteristics for ships. In short term, it is concluded that internal combustion engines are still the major hybridization element with different energy storage systems. New regulations on the mitigation of harmful emissions will accelerate the transition to hybrid power which is an important option for the ultimate zero-carbon shipping goal.

Design and Simulation of Ammonia-Fueled SOFC-ICE Hybrid Power System for Ship Application,"Ma, Y. and Wang, Z. and Yu, S. and Han, F. and Ji, Y. and Cai, W.",2022,"2022 Ieee 7th International Conference On Power And Renewable Energy, Icpre 2022","Increasingly stringent emission limits and carbon reduction needs of the shipping industry have forced shipowners and builders to look for alternative fuels and related power technology. Using ammonia to fuel solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems is one of the most efficient and environment-friendly technology options for the marine power. Considering the efficient utilization of exhaust gas and the effective integration of hybrid system, the combination of SOFC and other power technologies can achieve higher efficiency. In view of the current promotion of low-carbon/zero carbon fuel in the maritime industry and the integration of efficient and stable complementary SOFC and internal combustion engine (ICE) hybrid, it will be applied on ships in the future. Therefore, this paper designed an ammonia-fueled SOFC-ICE hybrid system for all-electric ship application. Based on MATLAB/SIMULINL, the steady-state electrochemical model of SOFC and the look-up table model of ICE about load were established. It is found that the electric efficiency of the ammonia ICE can reach about 30%. Based on a typical oil tanker, the ammonia-fueled SOFC-ICE hybrid power system achieves an electrical efficiency of 46.6% when the installed power density of the ammonia-fueled SOFC is 0.3 W/cm2 and the SOFC/ICE power ratio is 70-30.

Optimizing Fuel Savings and Power System Reliability for All-Electric Hybrid Vessels using Model Predictive Control,"Yuan, Liza Chua Wan and Tjahjowidodo, Tegoeh and Lee, Gerald Seet Gim and Chan, Ricky",2017,NANA,"Increasingly stringent regulations on emission control and energy efficiency operations drives the maritime industry towards hybrid solutions incorporating energy storage and other alternative energy sources into marine power systems. In particular, commercial all-electric hybrid vessels with dynamic operations such as harbor tugs often face significant challenges in power management control to maximize fuel savings, in addition to ensuring power system reliability. An intelligent power management control strategy plays an important role in effectively managing the multiple energy sources and their constraints to achieve desired control objectives. Hence, in this paper, Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is proposed to address these challenges. The propose strategy shows comparative performance in terms of fuel savings when compared to the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS), with added advantage of improving power system reliability.",Engineering; Robotics,2017.9991,selected,
"Environmental regulations spark power savings, reliability and safety","Bynum, A.",2013,Sea Technology,"Increasingly stringent environmental policies are causing sea vessels to look at ways to adapt to reduce emissions. Thankfully, as marine operators explore new ship designs and technologies for achieving cleaner operations, they are also realizing other benefits from hybrid drives and energy storage solutions-including improved safety, reliability and cost savings. The technology has undergone significant advances across a wide range of marine applications over the past several years. The modernization of the ship would generate significant fuel savings, but the overall advantages would stem from energy storage. The ability to use energy reserves generated from the new technology would enable modernization with advanced, power-hungry weapons systems. The US Navy sources indicate hybrid-electric drives will increase vessel mission efficiency by allowing increased time at posts.

Feature 3: SE Asia: Backward shipping must shape up,NA,2012,Naval Architect,"Former car designer Richard Sauter has designed the 330,000 dwt Emax Deliverance solar hybrid post-panamax tanker by combining the excellence of a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) designed vessel, with a WÃ¤rtsila 7die; designed dual fuel engine and added some energy saving devices. Deliverance includes the MHI-designed air lubrication system, the DynaWing hybrid Wingmast and mainsail system, and Solbian marine solar panels. With a range of possible power sources, including wind, solar power, LNG and, diesel, Deliverance can sail at around l5 knots on around 20 Mw of power. With a full array of sails with Wingsail emulated efficiency, to a gradual reduction of all sails culminating in Wingmast reefing to sustainable and renewable sun power sources, DynaWing sails can deliver between 4 and 8 Mw of power while the Solbian Solar Panels can offer up to 4 Mw output. As a major Certified Carbon Offset Project, the carbon offset or reduction in greenhouse gas emissions achieved by Deliverance is 11 0,000 ton/yr of CO 2. Capital costs for Deliverance run at around 10-15% higher than a conventional vessel which operates with a 30 Mw output, however, MHI?s Bubble Hull design improves efficiency, significantly reducing the amount of power needed. Deliverance is a cost effective workhorse sized vessel which would normally cost around $180 million, with savings of up to 75% in fuel consumption and pollution costs is significantly reduced.",NA,2012.9837,selected,
Thermodynamic analysis of a combined gas turbine power plant with a solid oxide fuel cell for marine applications,"Welaya, Y.M.A. and Mosleh, M. and Ammar, N.R.",2013,International Journal Of Naval Architecture And Ocean Engineering,"Strong restrictions on emissions from marine power plants (particularly SOx, NOx) will probably be adopted in the near future. In this paper, a combined solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and gas turbine fuelled by natural gas is proposed as an attractive option to limit the environmental impact of the marine sector. It includes a study of a heat-recovery system for 18 MW SOFC fuelled by natural gas, to provide the electric power demand onboard commercial vessels. Feasible heat-recovery systems are investigated, taking into account different operating conditions of the combined system. Two types of SOFC are considered, tubular and planar SOFCs, operated with either natural gas or hydrogen fuels. This paper includes a detailed thermodynamic analysis for the combined system. Mass and energy balances are performed, not only for the whole plant but also for each individual component, in order to evaluate the thermal efficiency of the combined cycle. In addition, the effect of using natural gas as a fuel on the fuel cell voltage and performance is investigated. It is found that a high overall efficiency approaching 70% may be achieved with an optimum configuration using SOFC system under pressure.

Review of Alternative Energy Resource for the Future Ship Power,"Arief, I.S. and Fathalah, A.Z.M.",2022,Iop Conference Series: Earth And Environmental Science,"In the near future, reduce emissions from the combustion of the ship's main engine by increasing the propulsion efficiency of ships that are already operating and/or optimizing ship designs during the design process.

Hybrid propulsion: True hybrid power for marine propulsion,NA,2010,Motor Ship,"Ricardo, a consulting engineering firm, is renowned in marine diesel engine circles. The company works closely with several major large engine companies, and such work has increased in both volume and importance as rising fuel costs and tighter emission regulations have forced engine designers as well as vessel operators to look towards ever more radical solutions to raising efficiency without compromising cleanliness. The company is exploring advanced technology in the whole power and propulsion system. Advanced computer modeling and simulation technology permits relevant and in-depth research and development into fuel cell and hybrid technology using various techniques, in some cases executed in real time. The company sees considerable potential in radial turbines, bottoming- or organic-Rankine cycles, and split cycle regenerative engine technologies. Other current activities include research into true hybrid technologies for ship propulsion. Battery-based systems are an obvious choice, similar to those used in hybrid road vehicles, but batteries have proved less than ideal in marine applications. They are heavy, bulky, and costly in terms of initial investment and replacement. Fuel reforming has been a significant part of Ricardo's work. Energy recovery and energy storage technologies also have promising applications in the marine sector. However, as with most technologies, existing hybrid propulsion technology is cost effective up to a point, but becomes a very costly option as higher levels of CO2 reduction are demanded. Thus, Ricardo investigated other energy storage technologies. The most promising of which are hydraulics, ultra-capacitors, and flywheels, which all tend to score more highly than electro-chemical solutions - particularly flywheel.",NA,2010.8033,selected,
Assessment of wind energy in the United States Gulf of Mexico area as power supply for offshore oil platforms,"Haces-Fernandez, F. and Li, H. and Ramirez, D.",2018,Proceedings Of The Annual Offshore Technology Conference,"Offshore oil and gas platforms operate under independent power systems, using Gas Turbines (GT) to generate the required electricity. However, the nature of offshore operations causes GT to operate at 30% efficiency, which is low when compared with overall normal average efficiency of 55% for combined cycle gas power plants. This increases fuel consumption and the emission of air pollutants, among other disadvantages. The issue can be ameliorated by integrating the system to the onshore grid and to a wind energy system, supplemented with an energy storage component. This research developed a new methodology to evaluate the integration of offshore oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico to a hybrid electrical system of wind energy, battery components and interconnection to onshore electrical grid to improve its performance. The objectives included improving overall electric generation efficiency, decreasing both fuel consumption and air pollutant emissions and potentially increasing income by selling surplus energy from renewable sources. Geographic Information System (GIS) and Big Data analyses were applied to data generated by the NOAA's Wave Watch III to calculate offshore wind energy for assessment for use on more than 4,000 offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico from data provided by the USGS CMGP, while simultaneously evaluating interconnection feasibility with the onshore grid. The results for the distance analysis were favorable, considering the criteria expressed by previous research. Wind energy assessment revealed a seasonal behavior, with each month showing distinctive power outputs. High power levels were obtained from November to April while overall low power levels were observed from June to August. However most of the 4,000 platforms produced wind power levels above the commercial threshold and an important percentage of the locations produced power levels above capacity factor thresholds that made them exceptionally productive. Overall results indicated that all the locations were within accepted feasible distance from the coast and most of them had acceptable wind energy levels. The proposed GIS methodology can be applied for individual projects, with specific spatial and time resolution. The results of these studies can assist stakeholders on decision making processes of offshore projects. Copyright 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.",NA,2018.17851,selected,

In this context, hybrid ship power system architectures with diesel-electric generators and battery energy storage systems have drawn attention as an attractive solution to increase fuel efficiency and thereby reduce emissions. In this arrangement, the battery energy storage system is used as a buffer to decouple the load dynamics and thereby allow the engine to operate at its optimal operating range. The aim of this study is to assess the fuel saving that can be achieved with this arrangement in an electric ferry. Load profile of an actual ferry, operating between two terminals, is used to estimate the fuel-saving.

Optimal Design of a Hybrid Energy System for the Supply of Clean and Stable Energy to Offshore Installations,"Riboldi, L. and Alves, E.F. and Pilarczyk, M. and Tedeschi, E. and Nord, L.O.",2020,Frontiers In Energy Research,"This paper presents an innovative hybrid energy system for stable power and heat supply in offshore oil and gas installations. The proposed concept integrates offshore wind power, onsite gas turbines and an energy storage system based on fuel cell and electrolyzer stacks. It is expected to be an effective option to decarbonize the offshore petroleum sector as it allows a more extensive exploitation of the offshore wind resource by means of energy storage. To ascertain its potential, an integrated model was developed. The integrated model allows to simulate the process and electric grid performances. The inclusion of both domains provides a comprehensive picture of a given design operational performance. The feasibility of the proposed concept was first investigated through a parametric analysis where an understanding of its potential and limitations was gained. A rigorous optimization was then implemented to identify the designs resulting in the best performances and ultimately to obtain a comprehensive picture of the suitability of the concept. It is shown that a well-designed system can reduce carbon emissions compared, not only to a standard concept based on gas turbines (almost 1,300Â kt less CO2 emissions, making up for a relative 36% reduction), but also to the integration of a wind farm alone (more than 70Â kt less CO2 emissions, making up for a relative 3% reduction, but complying with grid dynamics requirements). Moreover, the energy storage system brings benefits to the electric grid stability and allows the integration of large wind power capacity without overpassing the 2% maximum frequency variation (as it is the case without energy storage). Not least, the optimization showed that the definition of an optimal design is a complex task, with little margin to further gains in terms of carbon emissions, likely due to technological limitations.

Energy storage analysis to increase large ship fuel efficiency,"Gully, B.H. and Webber, M.E. and Seepersad, C.C. and Thompson, R.C.",2009,"Proceedings Of The Asme 3rd International Conference On Energy Sustainability 2009, Es2009","The marine transportation industry is a significant contributor to global emissions of CO2 and other pollutants. Although marine emission standards have become increasingly stringent, increasing fuel efficiency remains the primary objective in terms of further reducing emissions and overall marine energy use. In this paper, a hybrid powertrain is investigated as a means of increasing fuel efficiency for a modern, 100 m class, passenger vessel. The hybrid powertrain includes an Energy Storage System (ESS) based on sodium sulfur (NaS) batteries and commercially available Caterpillar diesel engine-generator sets. The ship's power load profile is based on annual averages for similar vessels. A control strategy and simulation models are developed and implemented in Simulink to analyze the power and energy flows in the hybrid powertrain. The Simulink model is used to compare the base scenario of a ship without energy storage to a hybrid scenario employing a 7.5 MWh NaS battery pack with related control strategy. Annual fuel consumption is the primary measure that is used to assess efficiency. Unlike hybrid powertrains for light-duty surface vehicle transportation, which achieve efficiency gains on the order of 10-20% [8, 9, 10], the hybrid powertrain for a large ship is estimated to lower annual fuel consumption by approximately 2%. The surprisingly small level of fuel savings is explained largely by the granularity of marine power systems, which include multiple generators that can be switched on and off to maximize fuel efficiency.

Comparative study of a hybrid research vessel utilizing batteries or hydrogen fuel cells,"Klebanoff, L.E. and Caughlan, S.A.M. and Madsen, R.T. and Conard, C.J. and Leach, T.S. and Appelgate, T.B., Jr.",2021,International Journal Of Hydrogen Energy,"The Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) current coastal/local research vessel, the R/V Robert Gordon Sproul, is nearing the end of its service life and will soon require replacement. This study compares three potential variants for an R/V Sproul replacement vessel (SRV): a Baseline SRV consisting of a traditional diesel-electric powertrain, a Battery Hybrid SRV (battery/diesel-electric) and a Hydrogen Hybrid SRV (hydrogen fuel cell/diesel-electric). All three variants meet the science mission requirements of the SRV but with varying levels of zero-emission runtime, energy efficiency and emissions. The Battery Hybrid SRV can provide 2.5 h of zero emissions (battery only) operation, but could not complete any of the identified SRV science missions without also engaging the diesel generators. In contrast, the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV can provide 23.4 h of zero emission (hydrogen only) runtime, and can complete 74% of the SRV science missions solely with zero-emission operation. The superior performance of the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV is attributable to the higher volumetric energy storage density of the LH2/fuel cell combination. The capital costs of these vessels are estimated to be: âˆ¼ $21.4 M for the diesel-electric Baseline SRV, âˆ¼ $26.0 M for the Battery Hybrid SRV vessel and âˆ¼ $34.4 M for the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV. The â€œwell-to-wavesâ€ (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant emissions were estimated using various sourcings for the diesel fuel, electricity and hydrogen fuel. The lowest emission levels are achieved with the Hydrogen Hybrid variant using 100% renewable hydrogen. The annual WTW GHG emissions from the Hydrogen Hybrid using renewable LH2 in combination with fossil diesel in the hybrid arrangement yields a 26.7% GHG emissions reduction from the Baseline vessel using fossil-derived diesel fuel. The Battery Hybrid vessel with 100% renewable electricity combined with diesel fuel provides a 6.9% reduction in GHG emissions. Similar results are seen for the criteria pollutant emissions. The hybrid vessels are also compared with regard to operational safety. The study reveals that hydrogen fuel-cell technology provides an effective hybrid supplement to diesel power for a coastal/local research vessel. Â© 2021",NA,2021.2523,selected,

Weighted average representation for estimation of fuel saving and emissions reduction in hybrid marine power plants with strategic loading,"Miyazaki, M.R. and SÃ¸rensen, A.J.",2017,"Proceedings Of The 5th International Maritime-port Technology And Development Conference, Mtec 2017","Recent developments in marine power systems, battery technology and modification to class rules and regulations increased the opportunities to improve the efficiency and reduce the emissions in energy production by marine power plants. In this paper, an analysis of marine hybrid power plants is developed, focusing on understanding the operations with energy storage devices. It reviews the strategic loading methodology as well as proposes a steady state weighted average representation of the results. This will lead to a much more intuitive interpretation of the results, thus, an estimation of the fuel saving potential for hybrid vessels with strategic loading can be developed by simply analyzing the generator set fuel oil consumption curves. The need to develop a simple model to estimate the average emissions and fuel consumption is due to the fact that it can be further used to create optimization algorithms, aid in the hybrid power plant design and operation, or in future research in hybrid power plants. Very few studies have been conducted on understanding how the generator-sets and energy storage devices interact, and the reason why it reduces emissions and fuel consumption. This steady state approach takes into account the energy storage device maximum capacity, charge/discharge rate, and the energy storage device efficiency. Dynamical effects like the generator speed fluctuation and engine load ramping are disregarded. Through this geometrical approach, it becomes clear that for most engines, the biggest opportunity for fuel savings and emissions reduction is when at least one generator is disconnected from the grid, as shown on the cases studied, where the fuel savings and NOx emission reduction reached values of up to 15%. In the case of generator-set disconnection, the energy storage devices also serve as a spinning reserve. Copyright Â© 2017 by MTEC 2017 Organizers.",NA,2017.1511,selected,

Thermal power plant efficiency enhancement with Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion,"Soto, R. and Vergara, J.",2014,Applied Thermal Engineering,"In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, coastal thermal power plants would gain further opposition due to their heat rejection distressing the local ecosystem. Therefore, these plants need to enhance their thermal efficiency while reducing their environmental offense. In this study, a hybrid plant based on the principle of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion was coupled to a 740 MW coal-fired power plant project located at latitude 28 S where the surface to deepwater temperature difference would not suffice for regular OTEC plants. This paper presents the thermodynamical model to assess the overall efficiency gained by adopting an ammonia Rankine cycle plus a desalinating unit, heated by the power plant condenser discharge and refrigerated by cold deep seawater. The simulation allowed us to optimize a system that would finally enhance the plant power output by 25-37 MW, depending on the season, without added emissions while reducing dramatically the water temperature at discharge and also desalinating up to 5.8 million tons per year. The supplemental equipment was sized and the specific emissions reduction was estimated. We believe that this approach would improve the acceptability of thermal and nuclear power plant projects regardless of the plant location. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.
