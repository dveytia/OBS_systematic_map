Nonetheless, the bottleneck factor of CO2fixation trough microalgae is due to CO2 dissolution in water. Apart from the dissolution of CO2 from air into water is too slow to replace the assimilated CO2by microalgae, the solubility of CO2 in water decreases with increasing of salinity. Hence this paper describes the initiative using nanomaterial to increase the dissolution of CO2 in marine microalgae culture. Marine microalgae culture has been inoculated in 10 liter photobioreactor (PBR). The ambient temperature has been set at 25 Â°C and in 12 h / 12 h dark-light photoperiod. 10 g of zeolites 4a as nanomaterial has been used to increase the dissolution of CO2 in the saline cultured solution. Through this study, growth rate for culture added with zeolite was Î¼Z4A was 0.35 O.D.day-1, and cell doubling time T d-Z4Awas 1.96 day. In contrast the control culture growth rate Î¼control was 0.22 O.D.day-1, and for cell doubling times Tdcontrol it takes 3.15 day. The highest concentration of inorganic carbon in solution in microalgae culture with zeolite was 23.3 ppm while the control culture was only 15.4 ppm. Thus proof that zeolite 4A hastens the dissolution of CO2 in marine microalgae culture, therefore enhancing carbon capture trough biological means. Copyright Â© 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.."

The goal of this study was to determine whether blood OC concentrations can predict those in adipose tissue of sea turtles. Blood offers many benefits for monitoring OCs. It can be collected nondestructively from live turtles and can be sampled repeatedly for continuous monitoring. Organochlorine concentrations in blood may better represent the exposure levels of target tissues, but blood concentrations may fluctuate more than those in fatty tissues following recent dietary exposure or lipid mobilization. Paired fat and blood samples were collected from 44 live, juvenile loggerhead sea turtles and 10 juvenile Kemp's ridley sea turtle carcasses. Organochlorines were analyzed using gas chromatography with electron capture detection and mass spectrometry. Lipid-normalized OC concentrations measured in the blood significantly correlated to levels found in the fat samples of both species. This result suggests that sea turtle blood is a suitable alternative to fatty tissues for measuring OCs because blood concentrations reasonably represent those observed in the paired fat samples. However, blood OC concentrations calculated on a wet-mass basis were significantly and inversely correlated to lipid content in the fat samples. Therefore, caution should be used when monitoring spatial or temporal trends, as OC levels may increase in the blood following mobilization of fat stores, such as during long migrations, breeding, or disease events."

In operation, a piezo crystal flexes to push an ink or fluid drop out of the printhead nozzle while the thermal design uses a heating resistor to create a bubble that expands and exits the nozzle. In both designs there is intimate contact between the printhead and media being jetted. Jettable fluid delivery systems and other MEMS devices require reliable assembly of a variety of components. These components can be assembled through the use of molding materials, mechanical fasteners, and structural adhesives. Structural polymeric adhesives are most often the ideal choice because they mate the substrates to form a continuous surface. These bonding surfaces often consist of multi-layer silicon die, thin and thick wall engineered plastics, noble metals, and flexible substrates. The adhesives act as a barrier or seal, preventing the fluids from leaking while also protecting the device from potential environmental contaminates. This paper discusses polymeric material adhesion testing and common failure mechanisms associated with harsh environment fluid jetting. Some standard tests can be used to screen adhesives. One example of a widely used test is lap shear measurement, which can be developed for specific substrates. The test part can be evaluated at various temperatures as well as before and after exposure to a harsh chemical environment. If dissimilar substrates are to be bonded and a lap shear test is not practical, an alternative test can be developed. For example, a plastic and glass substrate bond may always fail with the glass fracturing. In this situation, the adhesive bond strength is not properly measured. Therefore, an alternative test, such as a shear strength push test, must be designed. In this test, a shear force is applied to an edge of a substrate bond, such as a die bonded to plastic. By altering the adhesive bond test, the failure mode will shift from a pull force to a peel force, thereby allowing for better representation of the actual bond strength for a given application."

Population declines resulting from climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances pose significant threats to intertidal biodiversity. For effective conservation strategies, patterns of gene flow and population genetic structure across the species distribution need to be clearly understood. We developed a suite of 15 polymorphic microsatellite markers using next generation sequencing of 53-55 individuals from two sites (south-western Victoria and central New South Wales, Australia) and a replicated spatially hierarchical sampling design. We observed low to moderate genetic variation across most loci (mean number of alleles per locus =3.26; mean expected heterozygosity =0.38) with no evidence of individual loci deviating significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Marker independence was confirmed with tests for linkage disequilibrium, and analyses indicated no evidence of null alleles across loci. Independent spatial autocorrelation analyses were performed for each site using multilocus genotypes and different relatedness measures. Both analyses indicated no significant patterns between relatedness and geographic distance, complemented by non-significant Hardy-Weinberg estimates (P < 0.05), suggesting that individuals from each site represent a randomly mating, outcrossing population. A preliminary investigation of population structure indicates that gene flow among sites is limited (F (ST) = 0.49), however more comprehensive sampling is needed to determine the extent of population structure across the species range (> 10,000 km). The genetic markers described provide a valuable resource for future population genetic assessments that will help guide conservation planning for H. banksii and the associated intertidal communities."

The trade is still rapidly evolving, creating challenges including the addition of new species that outpace effective management strategies. New species in the live coral trade initially command high prices, but as they become common the price radically decreases with feedback effects to the trade. To understand these trends, 21 years of live coral import data for the United States were assessed. Trade increased over 8\% per year between 1990 until the mid-2000s, and has since decreased by 9\% annually. The timing of the peak and decline varies among species, and is a result of the rising popularity of mini-reef ecosystem aquariums, the global financial crisis, and an increase in aquaculture production. The live coral trade offers opportunities for coral reef ecosystem conservation and sustainable economic benefits to coastal communities, but realization of these externalities will require effective data tracking."
"6",26635,"2021.2954","Comparing different generations of idealized solar geoengineering simulations in the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP)","Solar geoengineering has been receiving increased attention in recent years as a potential temporary solution to offset global warming. One method of approximating global-scale solar geoengineering in climate models is via solar reduction experiments. Two generations of models in the Geo-engineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) have now simulated offsetting a quadrupling of the CO2 concentration with solar reduction. This simulation is idealized and designed to elicit large responses in the models. Here, we show that energetics, temperature, and hydrological cycle changes in this experiment are statistically indistinguishable between the two ensembles. Of the variables analyzed here, the only major differences involve highly parameterized and uncertain processes, such as cloud forcing or terrestrial net primary productivity. We conclude that despite numerous structural differences and uncertainties in models over the past two generations of models, including an increase in climate sensitivity in the latest generation of models, the models are consistent in their aggregate climate response to global solar dimming."
"7",2914,"2020.366","Coral cover surveys corroborate predictions on reef adaptive potential to thermal stress","As anomalous heat waves are causing the widespread decline of coral reefs worldwide, there is an urgent need to identify coral populations tolerant to thermal stress. Heat stress adaptive potential is the degree of tolerance expected from evolutionary processes and, for a given reef, depends on the arrival of propagules from reefs exposed to recurrent thermal stress. For this reason, assessing spatial patterns of thermal adaptation and reef connectivity is of paramount importance to inform conservation strategies. In this work, we applied a seascape genomics framework to characterize the spatial patterns of thermal adaptation and connectivity for coral reefs of New Caledonia (Southern Pacific). In this approach, remote sensing of seascape conditions was combined with genomic data from three coral species. For every reef of the region, we computed a probability of heat stress adaptation, and two indices forecasting inbound and outbound connectivity. We then compared our indicators to field survey data, and observed that decrease of coral cover after heat stress was lower at reefs predicted with high probability of adaptation and inbound connectivity. Last, we discussed how these indicators can be used to inform local conservation strategies and preserve the adaptive potential of New Caledonian reefs."

Data were used to examine the suitability of four methods for estimating annual net aerial primary production (NAPP) of a marsh subject to energetic tidal flooding. Shoots start to grow in April and reach maximum height (about 0.5 m) and weight in October. Maximum shoot density (900-1,600 m-2) occurs around June and drops thereafter due to the export of entire shoots. The average shoot produces about seven leaves and at least 2-3 are lost during the growing season. All remaining vegetation dies before the end of November. Methods based on harvesting vegetation underestimated NAPP, especially at lower elevations where export is greater due to more frequent and prolonged tidal flooding. The highest NAPP values, on the order of 500-600 g m-2 y-1, were obtained using methods based on the population dynamics of individual shoots. These methods are recommended for energetic tidal environments because they include the production of vegetation exported during the growing season. Â© 1989 Esrtuarine Research Federation."

Several invasive plant species, however, have invaded the sub-Antarctic Southern Ocean islands and increasingly threaten the vulnerability of maritime and continental Antarctica, particularly with changes in climate. Aims We provide an overview of issues to consider with regard to the impact, ecology and management of non-native plants in the Antarctic, focusing on knowledge gained and recent research results from the sub-Antarctic with possible application to Antarctica. Methods We provide a brief review of literature and bring together experience and previously unpublished research with Poa annua and Stellaria media on Macquarie Island. Results While no one set of biological characteristics predicts plant invasiveness in the sub-Antarctic, all are adapted to survive extreme cold conditions and persistence is enabled through large and long-lived soil seed banks. Ecological drivers for invasion include accidental human introductions and continuing movement, along with animal and other disturbance to soil. Conclusion The invasive cold-tolerant plant species now prevalent on sub-Antarctic islands also pose a threat to Antarctica due to a warming climate and so efforts should continue to prevent further spread, while developing effective, low-impact control and eradication options to protect these high-value extreme ecosystems."

Meanwhile, rusting is a continuous process, and it is the main corrosion product of atmospheric corrosion. The current study investigates the effects of rust on weathering steel in the localized region of Digha, a sea resort of West Bengal, India. The investigations have been performed by purposely accelerating the rusting of weathering steel in a laboratory within one week in order to simulate approximately 18 months of actual rusting that can be achieved at field exposure. Anodic polarization of weathering steel comparable to potentiostatic passivation is obtained by shorting weathering steel with nobler metals, such as copper or graphite. The effect of rust formation on corrosion resistance after being immersed in 0.01 M KCl solutions for polished and unpolished samples has been investigated using electrochemical techniques, such as potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The rusted surfaces' morphology and composition were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Based on the obtained results, it is concluded that the progressive rusting of weathering steel leads to a decrease in corrosion rate."

The Eemshaven was opened on June 7, 1973 by Queen Juliana and in 1976 the first company, AG Ems, settled in the harbor. The former design of the harbor contained mooring spaces for vessels up to 40,000 tons. One of the most important growth factors of the Eemshaven is going to be the wind farms that will be developed near to Groningen, one of them to become one of the biggest offshore wind farms in the world. One of the companies that was attracted to the Eemshaven is Vopak, who opened their tank storage terminal in 2012. The Eemshaven has not been the most successful harbor until now, but when one third of the Netherlands' electricity will be produced here, the national importance will grow. The investments mean a great boost of the harbour's main activities, the lease of land, the transshipment of goods and the employment in the region."
"12",336794,"2015.11170","Dynamic response and governor tuning of a long penstock pumped-storage hydropower plant equipped with a pump-turbine and a doubly fed induction generator","In this paper, the dynamic response of a long penstock pumped-storage hydropower plant which is equipped with a single pump-turbine and a doubly-fed induction machine, is analyzed in detail in generating mode. The pumped-storage hydropower plant is connected to a small island power system with thermal generation, and provides load-frequency control under the orders of an automatic generation control system. The output power of the pumped-storage hydropower plant is assumed to be controlled by the rotor-side frequency converter. The unit running speed is controlled by an isochronous PI governor. The dynamic response of the pumped-storage hydropower plant is analyzed by using a linearized reduced order dynamic model, which considers the elastic water column effects in the penstock. Two governor tuning criteria are proposed in the paper: one is devised from the root locus analysis of the plant dynamic model, and the other one is based on a Pareto approach. The proposed tuning criteria are compared with each other and with a recently published tuning criterion through a set of commonly used performance indexes and by means of simulations with a nonlinear dynamic model.

In this paper, I first review briefly how the various parton distributions of a nucleon may be extracted from high energy physics experiments. I then proceed to consider how the sea distributions of a free nucleon at low and moderate Q2 (e.g., up to 20 GeV2) may be obtained in the meson-baryon picture, a proposal made by Hwang, Speth, and Brown. Using the form factors associated with the couplings of mesons to baryons such as piNN, piNDELTA, and KNLAMBDA couplings which are constrained by the CCFR neutrino data, we rind that the model yields predictions consistent with the CDHS and Fermilab E615 data on the sea-to-valence ratio. We also find that the recent finding by the New Muon Collaboration (NMC) on the violation of the Gottfried sum rule can be understood quantitatively. Finally, we consider, using the pion as the example, how valence quark distributions of a hadron may be linked to the hadron wave function written in the light-cone language. Specifically, we use the leading pion wave function that is constrained by the QCD sum rules, and find that, at Q2 almost-equal-to (0.5 GeV)2, the leading Fock component accounts for about 40 \% of the observed valence quark distributions in the pion. The question of how to generate the entire valence quark distributions from the valence quark distribution calculated from the leading Fock component is briefly considered again using the specific proposal of Hwang, Speth, and Brown."

Compliant elastic elements at the top of the mooring allow the buoy to move freely with the waves without having to accelerate the mooring and heavy instrumentation. About 710 N (160 lbf.) of midwater flotation at the bottom of the elastic elements help keep the lower part of the mooring taut. The elastic elements provided about 1.3 kN (300 lbf.) of mooring pretension, and, depending on the horizontal current and the wave activity, the tension at the buoy could rise to about 3.5 kN (800 lbf.). Computer modeling of the mooring showed no vertical and minimal horizontal motion in the lower part of the mooring and reasonable tensions that would allow the buoy to follow the waves. Data from the accelerometer in the buoy (telemetered to shore in real-time), the SeaCats in-line and ADCP near the bottom were of high quality. The mooring was recovered by releasing a float from mid-depth that brought a line to the surface from below the elastic elements to allow the mooring (with sensors) and anchor to be retrieved. Validation of the accelerometer wave observations with a near-surface moored Waves ADCP showed good agreement and indicates that the Waves ADCP technology may be used for deeper water waves observations from subsurface moorings."

All the port deploy several conventional navigation buoys with marker lamps in the navigational channel for guiding the ships entry into the port. Generally, these marker lamps are powered by batteries using the photovoltaic power module. The efficiency of PV modules mostly affected by waves and weather and it demands regular maintenance. In order to replace the PV modules, National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) has indigenously developed wave powered navigational buoy similar to the existing buoys and the major advantage of this wave powered buoys is, the power will be extracted throughout the day. This power module is such as designed, it will generate power in low wave conditions. Since the waves are very random in nature, the extraction of maximum power is a challenge. The objective of this paper is to discuss about the development of the power takeoff system (PTO), which includes the selection of generator, design of charging circuit and sizing of the battery bank to catch the power at maximum efficiency. A range of combinations of chosen power modules is tested under various input frequencies in the oscillatory airflow test rig at the ocean engineering department of IIT Madras. To validate the design of the power takeoff system, NIOT has successfully filled out open sea trial at off Ennore, Chennai and generated power under various input wave conditions also presented in this paper.

In this article, we carefully reviewed and discussed the reported fundamental lab-scale experimental attempts to successfully store CO2 as hydrate in sediments. The CO2 hydrate formation thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanism insights in porous media are critically discussed to reveal the state of the art and the current challenges facing the implementation of the HBCS technique and provide guidelines and pathways toward a high CO2 storage capacity. In addition, factors affecting CO2 hydrate formation and hydrate formation mechanisms in various types of porous media are discussed. Factors that mainly control the CO2 storage capacity in porous media are driving force, porosity, capillary effect, gas and liquid permeability, particle size, and surface area. However, mass transfer limitation, potential storage site, CO2 transportation, CO2 injection technique, cost, environmental constraints, and CO2 stability are the main challenges toward the technological readiness of the HBCS. The findings in this work provide useful guidelines and pathways which could lead to an increase in CO2 storage capacity as hydrate for cleaner earth in the future."

These gravity-flow deposits are well displayed in a 25 meter long core from the Depco Inc. No. 1 D. H. Y. State 'A' well drilled in Eddy County, New Mexico. Transport of large lithoclasts of wackestones, packstones, and grainstones indicates early lithification of these rocks probably by meteoric diagenesis. Later subsurface diagenesis resulted in cementation by saddle dolomite and Fe-rich, coarse-crystalline calcite. The larger lime boundstone blocks contain moldic and intraparticle porosity and a few of the grainstone clasts contain interparticle and moldic porosity inherited from the source area on the shelf. The porosity network in the Depco core consists of these porous limestone clasts and blocks separated by nonporous calcareous siliciclastic mudstone. This arrangement of blocks and matrix results in a poor reservoir because there is no porosity collection network, such as fractures."

Emerging evidence suggests that kelps have the potential to sequester carbon through the export of detritus to deep marine sinks, yet how much of this detrital carbon is remineralized through grazing and microbial decomposition before it reaches these sinks remains a critical knowledge gap. We measured decay of Laminaria hyperborea detritus in shallow kelp forests (10 m) and adjacent deep fjords (300 m), and experimentally tested the effect of temperature and oxygen conditions similar to those at these habitats in ex situ experiments. Initial decay rate (k) was high (-0.107 to -0.183 d(-1)) with 40-60\% of the original carbon biomass being lost within few weeks, after which decay rates slowed down (k = -0.009 to -0.038 d(-1)). Temperature had little effect on the rate and extent of decomposition within the temperature range tested (4-10 degrees C). Blade detritus decomposed almost completely in 300 d under aerobic conditions. Anaerobic decay of both blade and stipe detritus ceased, in contrast, after 150-200 d, leaving 20-30\% of the initial biomass to decompose extremely slowly or not at all. Decomposition was followed by changes in chemical composition; C:N ratios increased substantially, while mannitol and phenolics disappeared almost completely from the detritus matrix. Slow and incomplete anaerobic decomposition suggest that the potential for long-term burial and sequestration of kelp carbon will be enhanced if detritus is exported to nearby deep areas with permanent or periodic hypoxia near the bottom."

The integration of thermoelectric generators in the SCO2 Brayton cycle will remain the inherent advantages and further optimize the system performance, especially on special occasions with high requirements of compactness such as heat recovery systems in the marine environment. The presented study proposed a novel type of SCO2 recompression Brayton cycle coupled with a thermoelectric recuperator for the marine environment and combined thermoelectric generators inside the SCO2 Brayton cycle. The influence of the thermoelectric recuperator on the performance of the overall system and other components is discussed, and the optimized design parameters of the thermoelectric recuperator are explored. The results show that the thermoelectric recuperator in the SCO2 cycle system improves the cycle efficiency from 32.9 % to 34.7 % and increases the cycle output power from 261 kW to 276 kW. Moreover, the transient response characteristics of the thermoelectric recuperator under disturbing signals and the working performance of the system under variable working conditions are examined, and the economic analysis is developed as well.

"21",314620,"2020.21913","Recent updates on smart water EOR in limestone","Experimental data confirm that the EOR-effects observed during Smart Water flooding can be explained by wettability alteration toward more water-wet conditions. Detailed knowledge about the important crude oil - brine - rock parameters affecting reservoir wetting, fluid flow and wettability alteration in oil reservoirs is needed when Smart Water EOR potential for reservoirs should be predicted. Both field observations and laboratory experiments confirm that seawater behaves as a Smart Water in limestone reservoirs, significantly improving the oil recovery. Laboratory core experiments have been performed to evaluate the effects of polar components present in crude oil on core wettability during core restoration. Spontaneous imbibition and viscous flooding oil recovery tests have been performed on the restored cores to evaluate the effect of initial core wettability on ultimate oil recoveries. The results have been compared with oil recovery tests that include wettability alteration induced by Smart Water. The experimental results confirmed that adsorption of polar components in crude oil dictates the core wettability established during the core restoration, and strongly water-wet outcrop cores became mixed-wet. The amount of oil that the core was exposed to affected the degree of water wetness, and therefore the crude oil amount needs to be accounted for in core restoration procedures. Oil recovery experiments showed that the ultimate oil recovery increased with increasing water wetness in the cores, confirming that increased positive capillary forces, resulting from wettability alteration, significantly affected fluid flow in porous media, improving oil recovery. The results are in line with the proposed chemical Smart water EOR model valid for both carbonate and sandstone. Wettability alteration toward more water-wet conditions induces increased capillary forces and improved microscopic sweep efficiency. Ultimate oil recovery in was significantly influenced by the core wettability, increasing with water wetness, confirming that capillary forces is an important recovery parameter. Only small changes in core wetting have significant effects on ultimate recoveries, confirming that laboratory core restoration procedures need to be optimized when recovery potentials for reservoirs should be estimated.

Here we assess the catchment scale climate and geomorphic controls on SOC. The study was conducted on the east coast of New South Wales, Australia and focussed on a 562 km(2) (Krui River) catchment sampled in 2006 and 2015 and a 606 km(2) (Merriwa River) catchment sampled in 2015. Both catchments have similar soils, topography and landuse. There was no significant difference in SOC between 2006 and 2014 data sets, indicating that SOC was temporally stable over the intervening 8 years (Krui catchment), despite the seasonal variability in climate such as rainfall. SOC concentration was also shown to have no significant difference between Krui catchment and Merriwa catchment, indicating that SOC is spatially stable for catchments of similar land-use, climate and geomorphology. SOC concentrations from all three data sets were compared to a range of terrain attributes. Similar with other studies, elevation, as a surrogate for orographic rainfall, was found to have the strongest significant control on SOC \% at the large catchment scale. Confirmation of the use of elevation as a surrogate for rainfall was made by comparing SOC with rainfall obtained from a network of weather stations across the study sites. Relationships between SOC and other terrain attributes found inconsistent relationships. The findings demonstrate that for catchments with similar soils, topography and climate that SOC can be reliably predicted using simple topographic variables. The methods here provide a robust tool which can be used for SOC assessment at other sites as well as assist in understanding SOC distribution and controls for longer term and regional scales."

Two proportional-integral-derivative (PID) damping controllers and two fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) of the proposed GUPFC are designed to improve the damping of the dominant modes of the studied multi-machine power system under different operating conditions, respectively. Eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear-model simulations are both performed to examine the effectiveness of the proposed GUPFC equipped with the designed damping controllers.

To study this issue, a design and manufacturing method of a stretchable and large-scale guided wave sensor network is proposed in this article. The key principle of the method is to design and manufacture the guided wave sensor network in a limited scale and expand it in a large-scale for aircraft smart skin of structural health monitoring. To ensure the excellent stretchability of the network, the design method of a serpentine-based fractal island-interconnect structure combined with the flexible printed circuit manufacturing process is proposed. The whole manufacturing process of the guided wave sensor network is realized by the mature flexible printed circuit process and the piezoelectric transducers (referred to as PZTs) are integrated with the network by reflow soldering which is compatible with the flexible printed circuit process, which greatly reduce manufacturing costs, simplify manufacturing process, and improve the yield and stability of the network. The guided wave sensor network can be uniaxially stretched to 500\% of its original size and work well when fully expanded to cover 2500\% of its original area. The test results of guided wave response show that the PZTs on the network can excite and receive guided wave signal normally. In addition, the network is placed on the surface of a carbon fiber composite laminate with stiffeners and the validation results show that the network can be applied to both active and passive guided wave-based structural health monitoring of composite structures, including damage imaging and impact imaging."

While the results are consistent with those of Hammond et al. (1996) and Hales (2003), the broader range of environmental variables considered in this study allows us to show that the depth of oxidation varies systematically with the integrated sedimentary organic matter oxidation rate. The scale length for oxidation varies from large values of about 4 cm when the organic matter oxidation rate is 5 mu mol/cm(2)/y to about 0.35 cm at oxidation rates above 20 mu mol/cm(2)/y. We have included this variability of organic matter oxidation depth in models of calcite dissolution. Our results show that variations in oxidation depth at a constant degree of supersaturation may result in changes in metabolic dissolution efficiency that are similar in magnitude to those resulting from basin-wide variations in the degree of supersaturation with respect to calcite. The model shows that, when the ratio of sedimentary organic matter oxidation rate to calcite rain rate is held fixed at 0.8 mol/mol, metabolic dissolution is likely to be significant at all bottom-water saturation levels and may result in dissolution of up to 50\% of the calcite rain at the calcite saturation horizon.

Analysis of compiled data on mangrove area shows that more than 60\% of the total mangrove area is found in just ten countries. The largest areas of mangroves are found in Asia and Africa, followed by North and Central America. Due to various reasons, loss of mangroves continues at alarming rates, but in the last two decades, the rate of net loss is showing signs of slowing down. Diversion of mangrove wetlands for aquaculture, agriculture, infrastructure, and tourism activities is among the major causes of the reported decrease in mangrove areas over time. Mangrove species involving agroforestry systems, agro-aqua farming, and providing alternate livelihood and community-based management of mangroves are indispensable component of mangrove management. Such efforts help in restoration and regeneration of mangrove, address the coastal land degradation, and provide livelihood support to the coastal population."
"27",176309,"2012.6343","Trophic impact of long-lived species indicated by population dynamics in the short-lived hydrozoan Eudendrium racemosum","Population dynamics, morphology, density, lipid contents and prey capture rates were studied in a patchy population of the tree-like passive suspension feeder Eudendrium racemosum (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) during seasonal cycles. Density and size of colonies oscillated due to intraspecific competition (following the self-thinning rule) and predation (nudibranchs) showing size distributions in which alternatively large-and small-sized colonies were more abundant. Increase in the trophic impact on the water column was correlated with colony size (30.7 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in late spring-early summer compared with 10.2 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in the rest of the year). Lipid accumulation in the hydrocauli followed the same trend, being higher during the reproductive period (140 mu g lipids mg(-1) organic matter {[}OM]) compared with the rest of the year (70 mu g lipids mg(-1) OM). The short time cyclic variations reproduce, in a short time scale, the variations studied in other benthic suspension feeders, suggesting E. racemosum as a model organism to better understand the importance of large colonies in long-lived species in benthic-pelagic coupling processes. The accordance with the self-thinning rule found for this animal species strengthens the animal forest concept (a 3-dimensional live structure composed mainly by heterotrophic organisms such as gorgonians, bryozoans, and sponges), confirming the validity of the utilization, by marine ecologists, of the conceptual tools developed for terrestrial forest sciences. It is suggested that the impact of mature populations on benthic-pelagic coupling and biogeochemical cycles, simulated for long-lived species, could be validated by studying fast-growing species, in order to understand the importance of the preservation of complex structures and long-lived eco-engineering organisms in benthic habitats."

"29",225445,"2022.18846","Understanding risks and consequences of pathogen infections on the physiological performance of outmigrating Chinook salmon","The greatest concentration of at-risk anadromous salmonids is found in California (USA)-the populations that have been negatively impacted by the degradation of freshwater ecosystems. While climate-driven environmental changes threaten salmonids directly, they also change the life cycle dynamics and geographic distribution of pathogens, their resulting host-pathogen interactions and potential for disease progression. Recent studies have established the correlation between pathogen detection and salmonid smolt mortality during their migration to the ocean. The objective of the present study was to screen for up to 47 pathogens in juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that were held in cages at two key sites of the Sacramento River (CA, USA) and measure potential consequences on fish health. To do so, we used a combination of transcriptomic analysis, enzymatic assays for energy metabolism and hypoxia and thermal tolerance measures. Results revealed that fish were infected by two myxozoan parasites: Ceratonova shasta and Parvicapsula minibicornis within a 2-week deployment. Compared to the control fish maintained in our rearing facility, infected fish displayed reduced body mass, depleted hepatic glycogen stores and differential regulation of genes involved in the immune and general stress responses. This suggests that infected fish would have lower chances of migration success. In contrast, hypoxia and upper thermal tolerances were not affected by infection, suggesting that infection did not impair their capacity to cope with acute abiotic stressors tested in this study. An evaluation of long-term consequences of the observed reduced body mass and hepatic glycogen depletion is needed to establish a causal relationship between salmon parasitic infection and their migration success. This study highlights that to assess the potential sublethal effects of a stressor, or to determine a suitable management action for fish, studies need to consider a combination of endpoints from the molecular to the organismal level."

The purpose of this paper is to scrutinize the causes of this ecocide and the responses addressing such environmental challenges, including scientific strategies, political non-intervention, and the United Houma Nation's plans for preserving a sense of place and togetherness as a prerequisite for its cultural survival. Design/methodology/approach - This ethnographic investigation relies on participant observation, and interviews with tribal leaders, fishermen, trappers, as well as scientists and local politicians. In order to grasp the emic perspective, most interviews were conducted in the Houma French dialect. Findings - The Mississippi Delta epitomizes issues that will shape tomorrow's world, namely, the vulnerability of coastal areas and the flows of environmental refugees. As shown by this study, coastal residents do not make a passive flux of evacuees responding to state/NGO-run plans. Actually, they are chief agents who either develop resilient strategies or proactive relocation stratagems to avoid ethnocide. Their pragmatic methodologies provide valuable data for any crisis management efforts. Originality/value - This research gives a voice to the voiceless, and conveys their existential struggles from within - unlike most studies of endangered communities relying on outsiders' viewpoints. This perspective depicts the Houmas as actors of their survival who implement diverse tribal strategies for coping with environmental change."

An experimental test based on relaying propensity","According to the environmental cues hypothesis, female birds use information available to them in the early-season environment to fine-tune egg production annually. However, support for the hypothesis derives largely from correlational studies. In each year from 2002 to 2006, which spanned a period of extreme variation in environmental conditions, we removed eggs from early-laying rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata, burrow-nesting seabirds that lay a single-egg clutch. We then measured their relaying rates, relaying intervals, and breeding success. We also monitored the timing and success of breeding in control pairs, and control chick diets. If the experimental females base their relaying decision on early-season cues, then we predict that few will relay in years in which early-laying control birds breed unsuccessfully, and in which a preferred prey species, Pacific sandlance Ammodytes hexapterus, is in short supply in nestling diets. Results matched neither prediction. In each year, almost all (88-90\%) of the experimental females relaid, despite that the control pairs' breeding success (32-87\% fledged chicks), and their chicks' diets (twofold variation in proportion of sandlance), varied markedly. We conclude that female rhinoceros auklets did not modify their relaying decision in response to variation in environmental conditions, although relaying intervals and their own breeding success (0-78\%) covaried negatively. Our results may have important implications related to using seabirds as monitors of the marine environment."

The experiment was conducted with four iso-nitrogenous (44.8 \% crude protein) and iso-caloric (20.17 KJ g-1) diets supplemented with different levels (0, 10, 20, and 50 mg kg- 1) of HK L-137. The bighead catfish (n = 1800, average body weight: 9.69 +/- 0.24 g) were randomly introduced to 200-L composite tanks (filled with 150 L of fresh water) and stocked at 150 fish tank-1 in triplicates per dietary treatment for 60 days. The results showed that the diets supplemented with 10, 20, and 50 mg kg- 1 of HK L-137 significantly increased the growth, protein efficiency ratio, feed conversion ratio, survival rate, and lysozyme activity compared to the control. Furthermore, the diets supplemented with 20 and 50 mg kg- 1 or 10 and 20 mg kg- 1 of HK L-137 significantly enhanced the total white blood cell count or apparent digestibility coefficient of the fish, respectively. The fish fed the HK L137 diets (at 10, 20, and 50 mg kg- 1) revealed lower cumulative mortality than the control after challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila. Our results suggested that dietary supplementation of 10 mg kg- 1 HK L-137 is the most efficient in improving the performance and immunity of bighead catfish; however, this should be confirmed in further study under full-scale commercial trials."

A mechanical prestressing method has been devised and shown to give an increase in ultimate bond strength of 6 or more times that of a plain bonded connection. The method was developed by small scale testing using models with varying degrees of prestress. The test information was appreciably augmented by the results of a parametric study carried out using a new non-linear finite element program. The information obtained from the small scale tests and numerical study was used to design a series of large scale models. During the testing of these large models an alternative method of prestressing using expansive grout was also shown to produce satisfactory results. This test series confirmed that the results of the small scale tests and computer studies could be safely extrapolated to full scale connections. Based on these studies a new comprehensive equation is proposed for designers which accounts more accurately for pile length/diameter ratio than existing design rules and which for the first time pre-dicts the increase in bond strength in prestressed connections.

"34",319963,"2019.14882","Sediment transport processes during barrier island inundation under variations in cross-shore geometry and hydrodynamic forcing","Inundation of barrier islands can cause severe morphological changes, from the break-up of islands to sediment accretion. The response will depend on island geometry and hydrodynamic forcing. To explore this dependence, the non-hydrostatic wave model SWASH was used to investigate the relative importance of bedload transport processes, such as transport by mean flow, short- (0.05-1 Hz) and infragravity (0.005-0.05 Hz) waves during barrier island inundation for different island configurations and hydrodynamic conditions. The boundary conditions for the model are based on field observations on a Dutch barrier island. Model results indicate that waves dominate the sediment transport processes from outer surfzone until landwards of the island crest, either by transporting sediment directly or by providing sediment stirring for the mean flow transport. Transport by short waves was continuously landwards directed, while infragravity wave and mean flow transport was seaward or landward directed. Landward of the crest, sediment transport was mostly dominated by the mean flow. It was forced by the water level gradient, which determined the mean flow transport direction and magnitude in the inner surfzone and on the island top. Simulations suggest that short wave and mean flow transport are generally larger on steeper slopes, since wave energy dissipation is less and mean flow velocities are higher. The slope of the island top and the width of the island foremost affect the mean flow transport, while variations in inundation depth will additionally affect transport by short-wave acceleration skewness.

Beachwatch bacterial monitoring data collected between 1989 and 2016 were analysed to assess the impact of commissioning on bathing water quality along 32 km of coastline. Bacterial contamination was reduced by 26-99\% during the first 32 months post-commissioning and in the longer post-commissioning period, 1993 to 2016, bathing water quality improved for 31 beaches. Relatively stable bathing water quality was observed for five other beaches after the 2001 upgrade of another shoreline wastewater treatment plant. Bacterial contamination of bathing water in this 24-year post-commissioning period was most influenced by rainfall in the 24-h to 9 am on the day of sampling. Bacterial contamination from surfacing shore-blown wastewater plumes was not evident, whereas stormwater-delivered bacterial contamination was apparent and varied between beaches."

A process consisting of both the production of CO2 clathrate and its in-situ consolidation is proposed for applying to the above CO2 disposal system as an efficient process to obtain faster sedimentation of CO2 clathrate blocks in the ocean and to prevent adverse environmental effects in the deep ocean. The process is experimentally analyzed and evaluated. It was confirmed that the CO2 clathrate block is formed in the in-situ consolidation vessel through Compressing the CO2 clathrate powders produced in the reaction vessel. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the clathrate block settled smoothly in artificial sea water under deep ocean conditions and that the process is one suitable method for application to the system. In addition, analysis of the consolidation mechanism was performed for the CO2 clathrate. And it was found that consolidation proceeds via two step, i. e., the first one at low pressure shows the decrease in the spacing volume between the colonies consisting of CO2 clathrate powders with pressurizing, and the second one at high pressure shows the breaking down step of the colonies. The boundary pressure between the first and second steps is ca. 2.3 MPa. Also, the dissolution rate of CO2 clathrate block was measured CO2-free artificial sea water and the rate was ca. 1.9 m/s at maximum. Â© 1997, The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.

Such processes are biologically vital. In the present study, controlling mechanisms of elemental flocculation during estuarine mixing in northern and southern estuaries of Iran in relation to the various physical and chemical parameters of waters have been compared. Except for zinc and lead, for other studied elements in Minab River, water flocculate at higher rates in comparison with the rivers flowing into the Caspian Sea. Redox potential might have negative effect on flocculation process in Minab Estuary. Contrary to rivers flowing into the Caspian Sea, in Minab River elemental flocculation is governed by dissolved organic carbon and it shows a non-liner and conservative behavior during estuarine mixing which implies that dissolved organic carbon originates from terrigenous source. The results also shows that maximum removal of elements occurs in lower salinities (1.5 to 5.8 parts per thousand) for the rivers in North of Iran and 3.3 to 11.4 parts per thousand for Minab River in South of Iran. Flocculation of studied metal in different rivers results in reduction of overall metal pollution load by various percentages. The initial metal contents on river water and mean discharge of river might lead to higher flocculation rates."

"40",351826,"2012.11310","A study on the effects of tide on sedimentation in estuaries of the niger delta, Nigeria","Estuaries in the Niger Delta-Nigeria are influenced by tidal currents and wave actions due to their proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. Tidal current provides the energy required to move sediments in and out of the estuaries from the seashores, while wave actions curtails the deposition of sediments at the bottom of the estuaries as the bed get shallower, resulting in the modification and long-term regulation of siltation through erosion or accretion. The interaction between estuaries bathymetric shapes, tidal currents and wave actions can only be fully understood through analytical or mathematical relationships. Analytical methods are less accurate in predicting future tides, while none of the existing mathematical relationships can accurately predict tidal behavior in the Niger Delta region due to the fact that parameters governing tidal actions vary from region to region, hence the need for this study. This study shows the behavior of the estuaries in response to variation in tidal heights, currents and wave actions through mathematical modeling, a knowledge which is useful in planning and timing of marine activities that requires pre-knowledge of tidal levels, direction and current velocities. The models were formulated and calibrated using parameters generated from the hydrographic, hydraulics and geotechnical investigation, including local field observations and measurements conducted within the study area. Soil samples taken from the area are composed of peat, organic clays, silty clays and sand. Peat constitutes the dominant soil which is locally known as 'chikoko' with high compressibility and color ranging from dark brown to dark gray and texture from soft to firm. Typical bed material size (D50) is approximately 0.2mm. Tides in the region are mostly semidiurnal with tidal prism ranging from 0.4 to 1.5m. The tidal strength is strongest at the inlets and decreases with distance inland. The depth of the estuaries is controlled by the strength of the tidal currents. Areas very close to the ocean with stronger tidal effect are very deep; while shallow canals and creeks predominates the hub of the estuaries. The results obtained using the present models compared favorably with the field measurements. Average correlation coefficients of 0.9 were obtained in some cases. The results showed that the estuaries erodes, accretes, or remain stable, depending on the rate at which sediment is supplied or removed from them.

The authors hypothesized that sevoflurane would increase intracranial pressure as compared to propofol. Methods: In 20 patients with no evidence of mass effect undergoing transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, anesthesia was induced with intravenous fentanyl and propofol and maintained with 70\% nitrous oxide in oxygen and a continuous propofol infusion, 100 mu g.kg(-1).min(-1). The authors assigned patients to two groups randomized to receive only continued propofol infusion (n = 10) or sevoflurane Cn = 10) for 20 min. During the 20-min study period, each patient in the sevoflurane group received, in random order, two concentrations (0.5 times the minimum alveolar concentration {[}MAC] and 1.0 MAC end-tidal) of sevoflurane for 10 min each, The authors continuously monitored lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, blood pressure, heart rate, and anesthetic concentrations. Results: Lumbar CSF pressure increased by 2 +/- 2 mmHg (mean +/- SD) with both 0.5 MAC and 1 MAC of sevoflurane. Cerebral perfusion pressure decreased by 11 +/- 5 mmHg with 0.5 MAC and by 15 +/- 4 mmHg with 1.0 MAC of sevoflurane. Systolic blood pressure decreased with both concentrations of sevoflurane. To maintain blood pressure within predetermined limits (within +/- 20\% of baseline value), phenylephrine was administered to 5 of 10 patients in the sevoflurane group (range = 50-300 mu g) and no patients in the propofol group. Lumbar CSF pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and systolic blood pressure did not change in the propofol group. Conclusions: Sevoflurane, at 0.5 and 1.0 MAC, increases lumbar CSF pressure.

Long-eared bats from the genus Plecotus comprise numerous cryptic species occurring in the Mediterranean Region and present complex phylogenetic relationships and often unclear distributions, particularly at the edge of their known ranges and on islands. Here, we combine Species Distribution Models (SDMs), field surveys and molecular analyses to shed light on the presence of a cryptic long-eared bat species from North Africa, Plecotus gaisleri, on the islands of the Sicily Channel, providing strong evidence that this species also occurs in Europe, at least on the islands of the Western Mediterranean Sea that act as a crossroad between the Old Continent and Africa. Species Distribution Models built using African records of P. gaisleri and projected to the Sicily Channel Islands showed that all these islands are potentially suitable for the species. Molecular identification of Plecotus captured on Pantelleria, and recent data from Malta and Gozo, confirmed the species' presence on two of the islands in question. Besides confirming that P. gaisleri occurs on Pantelleria, haplotype network reconstructions highlighted moderate structuring between insular and continental populations of this species. Our results remark the role of Italy as a bat diversity hotspot in the Mediterranean and also highlight the need to include P. gaisleri in European faunal checklists and conservation directives, confirming the usefulness of combining different approaches to explore the presence of cryptic species outside their known ranges-a fundamental step to informing conservation."

This, combined with a desire to improve operational efficiency, led to the design of novel improvements to the CT intervention vessel. Innovative technologies from various applications were combined to provide the operator with a successful solution for CT intervention improvement. The CT intervention vessel concepts consisted of a full catenary CT system, dynamic positioning (DP) vessel, knuckle boom crane, and a heave-compensated gangway. The full catenary system was selected for this CT operation to help minimize the potential for lifting hazards, reduce offshore installation lead times, and improve the operating efficiency of the CT intervention vessel. The DP vessel eliminated anchoring requirements and provided enhanced efficiency for evacuation. The knuckle boom crane provided the capability to lift at different angles to reach equipment placement in difficult positions, even underneath the platform helideck.

The offshore energy hub concept consists in establishing an artificially constructed energy conversion and distribution hub that addresses two energy-related markets by power supply to public grids and by potentially enabling the conversion of renewable electricity into hydrogen or ammonia and supplying it ashore. Hence, the energy hub concept enables smart integration of offshore wind power into gas grids. Power generation on demand from stored green gas is able to cover residual power loads at low carbon intensity. Electrofuel production provides also the opportunity to export renewable fuels for sectors with traditionally high greenhouse gas emissions, e.g., agriculture or transportation. In this contribution an energy hub system in the North Sea is modeled and simulated to determine production quantities and efficiencies of electricity, hydrogen and ammonia. When comparing the efficiencies of production, storage, and transport values of 45.1â€“65% for hydrogen and values of 52â€“52.3% for ammonia were determined. Re-conversion to electricity with fuel cells of both hydrogen and ammonia is less efficient and cost worthly than their use in electrofuel applications. Because of emerging and potential cost reductions a sensitivity analysis is performed where lower capital costs (50%) lead to cost reductions in hydrogen (42â€“45%) and ammonia production (40â€“42%). Results show that energy hubs can become sustainable pillars in future energy systems through improving cost-competitiveness of wind power. Â© 2021 The Authors"

We define landscape position by distance to ocean shoreline and elevation above sea level, two metrics that integrate a suite of environmental and biotic factors. As shoreline and elevation change, suitability of a geo-referenced position for a given plant species may also change. The objectives of our study were to use two methods for measuring landscape position (GPS and hyperspectral/light detection and ranging or LIDAR) to develop habitat polygons, compare habitat polygons for five species representing several adaptive strategies, and illustrate change in landscape position due to migrating shoreline for a Virginia, USA barrier island. Habitat polygons for each species were distinct, represented several growth forms or functional groups, and were indicative of tolerances to biotic and abiotic stresses. The habitat polygon for Cakile edentula (annual forb) was relatively small, indicating narrow habitat requirements for the strand environment. Cirsium horridulum (biennial forb), with succulent shoots and roots, occurred on dunes where water is most limiting. For the dune-building grass, Ammophila breviligulata, as distance from shoreline increased, minimum elevation also increased. Two woody species occurred across the entire island; however, Morella cerifera (N-fixing shrub), was limited to mesic swales whereas Juniperus virginiana (evergreen tree), with the largest habitat polygon, occurred on both dunes and swales. For a geo-referenced point on the north end of Hog Island, distance to shoreline increased from the shoreline to 1100 m inland over 139 years. In contrast, the geo-referenced point on the eroding portion of the island decreased from 1700 m to 120 m from the ocean shoreline over the same time period. Where sea level rise and storms are expected to alter shorelines and island topography, generation of habitat polygons from hyperspectral and LIDAR imagery provide rapid assessment of potential effects on species distribution patterns at local and regional scales. Habitat polygons have broad applicability beyond coastal systems and may contribute to a rapid assessment or identification of vulnerability for species as climate patterns shift through time."

Definition, access, and demonstration of offshore storage resources can increase engagement of many countries in emissions reduction negotiations. A research capacity-building initiative is needed to focus on both proving up global geologic capacity offshore and developing international technical capacity to utilize offshore storage resources. Such an initiative must leverage the strengths of the collective technical experience and financial capacity of international governmental, industrial, and academic/research organizations to distribute the costs and risks associated with large-scale offshore CCS. One long-term success criteria of such an effort could be an accelerated path for offshore demonstration projects. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Web camera has an effective possibility for the monitoring of these phenomena, because they can acquire continuous data in relatively large areas. This research is evaluating the feasibility of web cameras to monitor coastal areas (benthic cover of a coral reef and shorelines). Composite visible images were useful for decrease of effects of halation and wave, it was found that they were effective way of monitoring under water. We were able to extract waterline accurately using near-infrared images, it was found that they were effective way of monitoring the change of shorelines by rising sea levels and intensified typhoon activities."

Currently, attention has primarily been focused on hull resistance and wave patterns while few studies have touched upon breaking bow wave under different trim conditions. This study aims to analyze the breaking bow wave of a surface combatant model with a length of 5.72 m DTMB (name of a surface combatant model) under different sailing attitudes at Fr = 0.35. The Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES) approach was adopted to study the breaking bow wave features such as plunging jet and air entrainment. The interface-compression algebraic Volume Of Fluid (VOF) method in OpenFOAM was used to capture the free surface. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach was firstly validated by comparing hull resistance and wave contour with the available experimental data. The study then delves into the influence of trim angles on breaking bow waves through simulations of the different conditions, i.e., 1 deg trim by bow, test condition and 1 deg trim by stern. The wave contour, breaking wave profile, vorticity field and the wake field at several transverse sections are then compared in three trim conditions, followed by an analysis of the initial evolution of bow wave breaking based on the turbulent kinetic energy and the vorticity field at four cross sections. The results suggest that trim by bow makes free surface sharper and wave amplitude larger in the breaking bow wave region. The reason is that trim by bow enlarges the attack angle of the bow, thus energizing the bow wave and generating a more violent free surface of bow wave breaking. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

We explored these islands for the occurrence of small RNA (sRNA) encoding genes. Previous systematic screens for enteric bacteria sRNAs were mainly carried out using the laboratory strain Escherichia coli K12, leading to the discovery of 80 new sRNA genes. These searches were based on conservation within closely related members of enteric bacteria and thus, sRNAs, unique to pathogenic strains were excluded. Here we describe the identification and characterization of 19 novel unique sRNA genes encoded within the genetic islands of the virulent strain Salmonella typhimurium. We show that the expression of many of the island-encoded genes is associated with stress conditions and stationary phase. Several of these sRNA genes are induced when Salmonella resides within macrophages. One sRNA, IsrJ, was further examined and found to affect the translocation efficiency of virulence-associated effector proteins into nonphagocytic cells. In addition, we report that unlike the majority of the E. coli sRNAs that are trans regulators, many of the island-encoded sRNAs affect the expression of cis-encoded genes. Our study suggests that the island encoded sRNA genes play an important role within the network that regulates bacterial adaptation to environmental changes and stress conditions and thus controls virulence."

Our analysis is motivated by the need to better understand the role and feedback of the carbon (C) cycle in climate change, by advances in measurement methods, and by apparent anomalies when comparing ice core and firn air Î´13C records from Law Dome and South Pole. We demonstrate improved consistency between Law Dome ice, South Pole firn, and the Cape Grim (Tasmania) atmospheric Î´13C data, providing evidence that our new record reliably extends direct atmospheric measurements back in time. We also show a revised version of early Î´13C measurements covering the last 1000 years, with a mean preindustrial level of -6.50â€°. Finally, we use a Kalman Filter Double Deconvolution to infer net natural CO2 fluxes between atmosphere, ocean, and land, which cause small Î´13C deviations from the predominant anthropogenically induced Î´13C decrease. The main features found from the previous Î´13C record are confirmed, including the ocean as the dominant cause for the 1940 A.D. CO2 leveling. Our new record provides a solid basis for future investigation of the causes of decadal to centennial variations of the preindustrial atmospheric CO2 concentration. Those causes are of potential significance for predicting future CO2 levels and when attempting atmospheric verification of recent and future global carbon emission mitigation measures through Coupled Climate Carbon Cycle Models.

In this study, using unsupplemented natural freshwater medium, we investigated the freshwater microalgal sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in the laboratory. The microalgal fixation of carbon, calculated by mass balance, showed that the freshwater microalgal CO2, uptake rate could reach 175 mg/L/day, with a CO2 consumption efficiency over 100\%. We found that the natural freshwater medium system achieved much higher carbon fixation efficiency than artificial media which used CO2 as the sole carbon source. This study demonstrated that in natural freshwater medium, the extent of microalgal carbon fixation transcended the substrate limitation by directly absorbing CO2 from air and thus the carbon in the microalgal biomass (100\%) was solely derived from atmosphere. Furthermore, our results suggested that the freshwater microalgal carbon fixation could account for a significant portion of the ``remaining unidentified{'' carbon sink. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The anthropogenic climate change results in a steady increase of hot days, tropical nights and heavy rainfall, affecting the quality of human comfort, especially in urban areas not only in hot regions of the world but also in Central Europe. Vertical greening systems are often a first-choice mitigation strategy to improve the deteriorating situation. By combining the use of natural resources like rainwater and solar radiation, the greening evaporates water and provides natural cooling. This paper deals with the efficiency and feasibility of vertical greening systems towards a relief in heat stress by simulating different constructions under local circumstances of three climate zones, focusing on the night-time. To carry out the simulations with microclimate simulation tool ENVI-met, an urban apartment complex was designed and provided with different kinds of vertical greening to investigate the various positive effects resulting from the green facade. As a shading device, the greened walls showed a significant decrease of wall surface temperatures of up to 18K. However, restricted transpiration fluxes obstruct exploiting the full potential of evaporative cooling, especially during night-time."

A better understanding of the spatiotemporal pattern of UHI is essential to health risk assessments and energy consumption management but challenging in a high-density environment due to the sparsely distributed meteorological stations and the highly diverse urban features. In this study, we modelled the spatiotemporal pattern of UHI effect using the land use regression (LUR) approach in geographic information system with meteorological records of the recent 4 years (2013â€“2016), sounding data and geographic predictors in Hong Kong. A total of 224 predictor variables were calculated and involved in model development. As a result, a total of 10 models were developed (daytime and nighttime, four seasons and annual average). As expected, meteorological records (CLD, Spd, MSLP) and sounding indices (KINX, CAPV and SHOW) are temporally correlated with UHI at high significance levels. On the top of the resultant LUR models, the influential spatial predictors of UHI with regression coefficients and their critical buffer width were also identified for the high-density urban scenario of Hong Kong. The study results indicate that the spatial pattern of UHI is largely determined by the LU/LC (RES1500, FVC500) and urban geomorphometry (hÂ¯ BVD, Î»Â¯F, Î¨sky and z0) in a high-density built environment, especially during nighttime. The resultant models could be adopted to enrich the current urban design guideline and help with the UHI mitigation. Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Because of sealing and specific design type of the WPWEH, the piezoelectric cantilever beam was entirely placed inside the water to increase the harvested electrical power. Three orientations of O1,O2 and O3were considered for placing the piezoelectric cantilever beam inside the water channel. In O1orientation, the cantilever beam was vertical and perpendicular to the floor while in O2and O3orientations, it was horizontal and parallel with the floor. The cantilever beam was perpendicular to the flow in O1andO2 and vibrates due to the longitudinal motion of wave particles while it was parallel with the flow in O3 and vibrates due to the transverse motion of wave particles. The influence of orientation, wave rate, and resonant frequency of the cantilever beam on the root mean square of the voltage and harvested electrical power was studied. The O1 orientation was selected as the optimum orientation for energy harvesting, because of having harmonic oscillations with a maximum generated voltage. The optimum electrical load resistance was calculated for the maximum harvested power. The results showed that the maximum density of the harvested electrical power from the WPWEH was increased compared to the other similar works. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

We assessed P sorption characteristics and adapted a P saturation index (PSI) for silage corn and blueberry fields in south coastal British Columbia (BC), Canada. We used 284 composite soil samples with contrasting P levels collected from eight silage corn and 23 blueberry fields across south coastal BC. The P sorption maximum (S-max) varied between 982 and 2532 mg P.kg(-1) and was influenced by aluminum concentration and organic matter content. The degree of P saturation was related to water-extractable P (Pw) by a quadratic regression with R-2 = 0.85. A critical Pw = 3.7 mg.kg(-1) was established across the two cropping systems. The silage corn fields with pH > 5.5 had critical PSI value of 10.4\%, and blueberry fields with pH < 4.7 had critical PSI value of 18.0\%. These results showed that the risk of P loss from soil in the silage corn was high, but it was low for blueberry because the critical PSI for silage corn fields was lower than for blueberry fields, and therefore, saturation would be more easily reached, even though more P is applied to blueberry fields. The combination of a critical PSI and Pw as agri-environmental indicators will help farmers and professionals to identify fields with risk of P loss, to implement a nutrient management plan, and to monitor how this risk changes with time."

Loss of LSCs results in limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) that can cause severe visual impairment. Patients with partial LSCD may respond to conservative therapies designed to rehabilitate the remaining LSCs. However, if these conservative approaches fail or, if complete loss of LSCs occurs, transplantation of LSCs or their alternatives is the only option. While a number of clinical studies utilizing diverse surgical and cell culture techniques have shown favorable results, a universal cure for LSCD is still not available. Knowledge of the potential risks and benefits of current approaches, and development of new technologies, is essential for further improvement of LSCD therapies.Areas covered: This review focuses on cell-based LSCD treatment approaches ranging from current available clinical therapies to preclinical studies of novel promising applications.Expert opinion: Improved understanding of LSC identity and development of LSC expansion methods will influence the evolution of successful LSCD therapies. Ultimately, future controlled clinical studies enabling direct comparison of the diverse employed approaches will help to identify the most effective treatment strategies."
"60",185142,"2010.5330","Mapping Sea Level from Space Precision Orbit Determination and Satellite Altimetry","Since 1992, a series of satellite missions, beginning with TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) and followed by Jason-1 and the Ocean Surface Topography Mission on Jason-2 (OSTM/Jason-2), have combined precision orbit determination (POD), a sophisticated method to determine precise height of spacecraft above the center of the Earth, and satellite altimetry to make precise measurements of sea surface height (SSH) and to map ocean surface topography. These missions' unprecedented continuous 18-year-long record of SSH has revolutionized oceanography. With support provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and European partners (the French space agency, also known as the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), and the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (Eumetsat)), these altimetry missions continue to help us understand the effects of the changing ocean on climate and provide significant benefits to society. Their measurements are being used to map SSH, geostrophic velocity, significant wave height, and wind speed over the global oceans. Orbiting at a height of 1,336 km above Earth's surface, the satellites measure the SSH every 6 km along the ground track, with an accuracy of 3-4 cm, covering the global oceans every 10 days. These highly accurate measurements would not be possible without the ability to determine the satellite's exact position relative to the center of the Earth. This is achieved by using POD. Three of the five instruments on board the spacecraft provide critical satellite tracking information for POD. The NASA Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA) uses satellite laser ranging. The CNES Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) system uses Doppler radio data and a high-performance global positioning system (GPS) receiver that provides range, precise carrier phase, and timing signals. POD combines satellite tracking information with accurate models of the forces acting on the satellite (e.g., gravity, aerodynamic drag) that govern the satellite motion. This process provides the very-high-precision satellite orbital heights that, together with satellite altimetry, allow accurate estimation of SSH. Data from these missions have proved to be a key to understanding Earth's delicate climate balance and are a critical component of global climate studies. They provide insight on short-term climate events, such as El Nino and La Nina, as well as longer-term climate events, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Altimeter data products are currently used by hundreds of researchers and operational users over the globe to monitor ocean circulation and improve our understanding of the role of the changing ocean in climate and weather. The missions' measurement of rising sea level, a direct result of Earth's warming climate, are especially important for coastal communities and decision makers and might help save lives and property. The legacy of satellite altimetry created by TIP; Jason-1, and OSTM/Jason-2 and the important data record they have collected are being continued. To ensure continuity with these missions, a group of nations and their science organizations plan to launch Jason-3 in 2013, Jason-CS/4 by 2017, and a next-generation Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission by end of the decade."
"61",277426,"2010.8199","The community climate system model","The Community Climate System Model (CCSM) is a modern worldclass climate code consisting of atmosphere, ocean, land, and sea-ice components coupled through exchange of mass, momentum, energy, and chemical species [98, 101]. Investigating the impact of climate change is a computationally expensive process, requiring significant computational resources [263]. Making progress on this problem also requires achieving reasonable throughput rates for individual experiments when integrating out to hundreds or thousands of simulation years. Climate models employ time-accurate numerical methods, and exploitation of significant parallelism in the time-direction has yet to be demonstrated in production climate models. For the CCSM this leaves functional parallelism between the component models, parallelizing over the spatial dimensions, and loop-level parallelism exploited within a shared-memory multi-processor compute node or a single processor. Due to as yet unavoidable parallel inefficiencies, the size of the spatial computational grids that can be used and still achieve the required throughput rates for long time integrations is small compared to other peta- and exa-scale computational science. As a consequence the maximum number of processors that can be applied in a single experiment is also relatively small. Parallel algorithms need to be highly optimized for even a modest number of computational threads to make best use of the limited amount of available parallelism.

"63",210267,"2013.9101","Adsorption of boron using glucamine-based chelate adsorbents","Adsorption of boron was investigated using glucamine-based chelate adsorbents, including resin type (Diaion (R) CRB 03 and Diaion (R) CRB 05) and a fiber type (Chelest Fiber (R) GRY-HW) adsorbents. The adsorption rate of boron was pseudo-second-order in all cases, with the Chelest Fiber having the highest adsorption rate. The adsorption of boron increased with pH in the acidic region but decreased with pH in the alkaline region. The adsorption isotherms obtained were of the Langmuir type and the order of the maximum adsorption was CRB 05 approximate to Chelest Fiber>CRB 03. The Chelest Fiber therefore has both a high adsorption rate and a high adsorption capacity for boron. Chromatographic recovery of boron can be achieved with CRB 05 and Chelest Fiber. The Chelest Fiber can adsorb boron at a high flow rate, with a space velocity of 25 h(-1) The effective adsorption-elution processing of boron from salt lake brine was achieved, although the adsorption rate and elution yield of boron were slightly decreased by components coexisting in the brine.

"64",303274,"2020.3630","Characterization of herbaceous encroachment on soil biogeochemical cycling within a coastal marsh","Vegetation transitions occur globally, altering ecosystem processing of organic matter and changing rates of soil biogeochemical cycling. In coastal marshes, more salt- and inundation-tolerant herbaceous species are encroaching on less tolerant species, concomitant with sea level rise. These species shifts could disrupt ecosystem services such as soil organic matter storage and the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). To determine how these ecosystem processes were affected by encroachment, we characterized biogeochemical properties and functions along a transect of encroaching Distichlis spicata L. Greene (saltgrass) on Spartina bakeri Merr. (cordgrass), two herbaceous species. During both the wet and dry season, nine soil cores were obtained from three community types: saltgrass end member, transition zone, and cordgrass end member. Total soil C, N, and organic matter were greatest within the saltgrass and transition zones. The saltgrass and transition zone soils also supported higher rates of enzyme activity and potentially mineralizable N and P than cordgrass soils during the dry season, and greater potential CO2 production and microbial biomass C during the wet season. Generally, the transition zone functioned similarly to the saltgrass zone and the encroachment gradient coincided with a 33 cm elevation change. Seasonally, low extractable nutrient availability (nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus) during the dry season was correlated with overall greater enzyme activity (N-acetyl-Î²-D-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, Î²-glucosidase, xylosidase, and cellobiosidase) and potentially mineralizable N and phosphorus (P) rates. This study demonstrates that shifts in dominant herbaceous species and accompanying abiotic gradients alters biogeochemical processing of organic matter within coastal marshes. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V."

The Wareishi Rock Cliff Sculpture, an important cultural property of Hiroshima Prefecture, is located near a shoreline. Local people often highlight that the sculpture seems to have recently been suffering from rapid degradation because of the direct impact of tidal ebb and flow. The present three-dimensional shape of this sculpture was investigated through multi-view stereo technique to accurately estimate the current degradation state. The same investigation was performed on the replica of the sculpture made in 1986 using a mold and exhibited in the Hiroshima Prefectural History Museum. The difference between the present shape of the sculpture and that of the replica revealed through the above investigation can be regarded as degradation of the sculpture that has occurred over the previous 30years. The result is as follows. The difference was detected mainly on the middle part of the sculpture, which is a belt-shaped portion parallel to the sea surface that is 20cm high. The total area where more than 3mm of displacement was detected constitutes 0.56\% of the whole measured area. Accordingly, the degradation of the Wareishi Rock Cliff Sculpture does not seem to be recently accelerated but seems to be progressing at a regular pace since it was carved, especially in relation to the sea level rise. If the degradation extends up to the face of the sculpture in the future, some countermeasures may be required. The method used in this study will contribute to the conservation of cultural heritage through evaluating the degradation state of the heritage precisely and to the study of weathering by detecting long-term weathering."

Nowadays, organic contamination in seawater represents a great challenge that needs to be solved. Specially, low-molecular-weight organic molecules may easily pass through distillation membranes with water steam and enter freshwater sources. In this study, we develop a solar distillation membrane (DM) for contaminated seawater desalination rather than grading treatment of contaminated seawater by integrating a large-scale TiO2 nanochannel membrane with plasmonic silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) via inhomogeneous assembling. Such incorporation enables a self-upstanding DM acting as an efficient broad-band plasmonic absorber (200-2500 nm) and possessing high solar steam efficiencies (82% at 6 kW m-2), thus driving the photothermal desalination and photocatalytic decontamination in a synchronous fashion. The resulting membranes exhibit a rapid evaporation rate (7.14 kg m-2 h-1), helping in achieving fresh water from seawater contaminated with a high concentration of organics with remarkable durability and reusability.

Installed and managed properly, aquaculture operations can be restorative to ocean environments, counter climate change, and relieve pressure to farm sensitive terrestrial environments. For these reasons, there is growing social acceptance and political pressure for marine aquaculture expansion, and State, Federal, and International, as well as eNGO-led initiatives are underway. Now is the time to invest in multi-disciplinary science-based teams that can signpost the sustainable pathway for marine aquaculture by developing monitoring and modeling tools and protocols for measuring associated ecosystem impacts and beneficial services. The yield on that investment will be healthy food and more carbon-neutral bio-fuels grown in ways that help heal our oceans. A sustained commitment by the United States now to develop the science and technology for future ocean farms will find an enthusiastic audience in young researchers and technologist around the world, who seek better ways to improve peopleâ€™s lives through their science and problem solving.

Variance preserving spectra revealed peak energies at 7.8, 3.9 and 2.5 days plus similar to 24 and similar to 12 hours consistent with dominant forcing by winds. At inshore sites the highest energy levels occurred at the surface and decrease uniformly with depth at all frequencies with local peaks centred at exactly 24 hours, corresponding to peak local wind energy. In contrast, offshore sites showed depth dependency in the peak spectral energy with evidence of regional influences and wave-guide effects due to density stratification. Hydrodynamic simulations using the 3-dimensional explicit finite difference model 3DD revealed local bathymetric controls on circulation. A coastal boundary layer, delineated by a shear zone similar to 2km offshore in the lee of Corambirra Point, south of Coffs Harbour, was associated with formation of transient eddies. Model simulations and independent ADCP data identified 3 dimensional flow structures typified by clockwise rotation of flows down through the water column at all sites except for the quiescent, shallow water site in the headland wake south of Corambirra Point. The area south of Corambirra Point was predisposed to clockwise eddy rotation while offshore flows were generally shore-parallel. Pollutant dispersal was shown to be significantly less within this coastal boundary layer thus highlighting the need to consider effects of coastal boundary layers when locating discharges such as ocean outfalls."

This work attempts to explain the role of these guide vanes on the basis of momentum theory. It is shown that the upstream vanes are more effective in enhancing efficiency than the downstream ones. A design method for guide vanes is suggested based on experimental data and potential theory. Experimental studies carried out by the authors do confirm the theory proposed."
"70",340276,"2015.14833","Experimental test and numerical shape optimization of a point pivoted absorber for wave energy conversion","This paper presents a numerical study on an innovative system for converting energy from waves. It consists of a point pivoted body which oscillates in presence of waves. The system uses a linear electrical generator which converts floating movements of the buoyant body into electrical power. The buoyant body floats, describing an arc, by means of two hinges. A suitable Power Take-off Device (PTO) is placed between buoy support arms and the fixed structure and has the function to convert the mechanical power of the linear oscillating motion of the connecting piston into electrical power. A design assumption is made on the PTO control system: PTO reaction force is assumed to be linearly dependent on piston oscillation velocity with a given force-speed gain. This coefficient is strictly connected to electrical generator characteristics and its value has an effect on power conversion efficiency . A scaled model of this system has also been tested in the wave/towing tank facility of Department of industrial Engineering (DII) of University of Naples ""Federico II"". A variety of numerical analyses, such as potential flow simulations and Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations, have been performed to predict the system performances. Numerical and experimental analyses have included the performances of the baseline geometry, both in free response and under wave excitation, in order to characterize the response of the system, and results have been used to understand which parameters affect more the power production. Finally a numerical optimization procedure has been carried out to optimize the shape of the converter with the final objective of increasing the generated power, eventually imposing a constraint on the amount of immersed volume. In this way, a modified configuration has been predicted with higher power output and the same value of submerged volume, but with different shape."

The penalties on performance and costs of fossil fuels fired power plants are given for the CO2 chemical absorption from flue gas using amines. The overcost of the generated kWh is around 60\%. Amongst other techniques, the chemical absorption is the most mature and the best suited to power plants. Decarbonisation of the fuel is much less penalising than chemical absorption (30\% overcost of the kWh) and produces hydrogen. A new concept of near zero CO2 emission power plant is presented, the so-called MATIANT cycle, using an oxyfuel with total recycling of the flue gas. The cost of its kWh is 50\% to 100\% higher than that of a current Combined Cycle. As a conclusion, the social cost (generation + external costs) of the kWh in fossil fuels fired plants with capture and sequestration of CO2 is of the same order of magnitude as that of on shore windmills and the social cost of the kWh generated in a MATIANT cycle is comparable to that of a Combined. Cycle with capture and storage of CO2 and in the range of social costs of windmills too."
"73",184108,"2010.4483","Assessing the impact of climate change on visitor behaviour and habitat use at the coast: A UK case study","Although tourism and recreation can bring economic benefits to an area, the presence of visitors may adversely impact biodiversity, particularly if they make use of sensitive environments. It is anticipated that the effects of global climate change alone may increase the vulnerability of many environments, but these effects may be magnified if warmer and drier weather encourages more visitors, or makes them more likely to participate in ecologically damaging activities. Using case study sites from the UK, this study examines how different types of beach visitors make use of coastal environments. Via a series of visitor surveys, information is elicited on the environmental preferences of a range of visitor types including walkers, bird watchers, and bathers. The use of different habitats by these visitors is also assessed via an analysis of walking routes undertaken in a Geographical Information System. From this, an assessment is made of the likely present day biodiversity impacts arising from different coastal users, and how these may change under a modified climate. This study finds that whilst higher temperatures are expected to increase visitor numbers, warmer weather may encourage greater participation in low impact activities such as bathing. The findings are discussed in the context of coastal management. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"74",99306,"2021.7968","Using a difference-in-differences and synthetic control approach to investigate the socioeconomic impacts of Oregon's marine reserves","As Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) expand in size and number, it is critical that we understand how they are impacting local communities. However, social impact evaluations on MPAs are often conducted with limited data points before and after MPA implementation, which can weaken the reliability of their results. To address this gap, we collected longitudinal American Community Survey (ACS) socioeconomic data on coastal communities and counties adjacent to marine reserves in Oregon. Oregon has both limited-take MPAs and stricter no-take marine reserves. This study focused solely on the marine reserves. We compared treatment and control units before and after marine reserve implementation using both difference-in-differences (DID) and synthetic control approaches. Each approach yielded different results, potentially providing a more complete picture of marine reserve impacts and long-term trends while also highlighting the need to consider the variability of ACS data collected from small communities. The percent of the population employed in tourism-related industries was the only significant model in both the DID and synthetic control approaches. Tourism employment increased post marine reserve implementation more in communities adjacent to the marine reserves than in more distant coastal communities. This result could indicate that marine reserves are bringing more visitors to the coast, thereby increasing the need for a more tourism-based economy. However, this may not be the case since most coastal visitors are unaware of Oregon's marine reserves and fewer than 10\% of business owners think the reserves have impacted their business. An alternative hypothesis is that the marine reserves were placed near communities with a prominent land-sea connection that were already shifting their economic base to focus more on tourism. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating how secondary data sources can be used to aid in a more comprehensive MPA impact evaluation, how two different impact evaluation approaches (i.e., synthetic control and DID) can result in differing conclusions, and how the robust synthetic control approach can be easily applied to improve MPA impact evaluations. As one element of a large-scale assessment of marine reserve impacts, this study also broadens our understanding of underlying trends on the Oregon coast and how the recently implemented marine reserves may be impacting nearby communities."

To investigate these ill effects and propose mitigation measures to prevent similar damage in future earthquakes, there was a need to quantify the variations in the depth to bedrock, shear stiffness, and fundamental site period (T0) across the port. To characterize T0 and develop shear-wave velocity (VS) profiles for use in seismic site-response analyses, horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) spectral ratio (HVSR) measurements and active-source and passive-wavefield surface-wave testing (i.e., multichannel analysis of surface wave [MASW] and microtremor array measurements [MAM], respectively) were performed across the port. A site-period map developed from 114 HVSR measurements indicates several areas of rapidly changing, complex subsurface structure. Deep (200+ m) VS profiles developed at six reference locations across the port were used to estimate the depth to soft (VS &gt; 760 m/s) and hard (VS &gt; 1500 m=s) rock. T0 estimates from HVSR measurements (T0 H/V) at the six reference locations are shown to be related to the depth of hard rock, based on linear viscoelastic transfer functions calculated from VS profiles truncated at several depths. T0 H/V measurements at two ground-motion stations near the port are also shown to be in reasonably good agreement with predominant periods of maximum spectral amplification recorded during both the 2016 KaikÅura and 2013 Cook Strait earthquakes, despite that these sites were also being affected by soil nonlinearity and potential 3D basin-edge effects.

Many successful horizontal gravel packs have been performed in this area, often in spite of increasingly difficult technical constraints on the operation. Critical limiting conditions on successful gravel pack placement include the combination of low fracture gradients, deep to ultra-deep water depths, and extended reach horizontal sections. This paper describes the lessons learned and best practices developed for offshore Brazil horizontal gravels packs under these severe conditions, supported by data from 20 jobs performed to-date. The analysis yields a better understanding of this type of open hole completion and demonstrates how to achieve a successful treatment under critical limiting conditions. Also discussed are several proven completion practices with application for future completion operations in the scenarios presented. Copyright 2004, Offshore Technology Conference."

Herein, we report the successful fabrication of novel inorganic-organic 2D/2D WO3/g-C3N4 nanosheet arrays (WO3/g-C3N4 NSAs) grown on a FTO substrate via a facile hydrothermal growth and deposition-annealing process, and their application in natural seawater splitting. The results indicate that the WO3/g-C3N4 NSAs exhibit a photo-current density of 0.73 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus RHE under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm(-2)) illumination, which is 2-fold higher than that of WO3 NSAs. More importantly, the WO3/g-C3N4 NSA photoanode is quite stable during seawater splitting and the photocurrent density does not substantially decrease after continuous illumination for 3600 s. The remarkably enhanced performance originates primarily from the formation of the WO3/g-C3N4 heterojunction between WO3 and g-C3N4 nanosheets, which accelerates charge transfer and separation, and prolongs the lifetime of electrons as demonstrated by EIS and Mott-Schottky analyses. Finally, a possible mechanism for the improved performance was proposed and discussed."

Specific fatty acids were used to identify the preferred food sources (i.e., mangroves, seagrass, phytoplankton, macroalgae, bacteria, and zooplankton) of dominant fauna (i.e., filter feeders, grazing snails, scavenger/predatory snails, shrimp, crabs, and fish), and their presence in water and sediment samples throughout the estuary. The diets of filter feeders were found to be dominated by dinoflagellates, whereas grazers showed a higher diatom contribution. Bacteria associated with organic debris on surface sediments and brown algal (Hormosira banksii) material in the form of suspended organic matter also accounted for a high proportion of most animal diets. Animals within higher trophic levels had diverse fatty acid profiles, revealing their varied feeding strategies and carbon sources. The stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) analyses of major primary producers and consumers/predators revealed a trend of N-15 enrichment with increasing trophic level, while delta C-13 values provided a generally good description of carbon flow through the food web. Overall results from both fatty acid profiles and stable isotopes indicate that a variety of carbon sources with a range of trophic pathways typify this food web. Moreover, none of the animals studied was dependent on a single food source. This study is the first to use a comprehensive fatty acid biomarker and stable isotope approach to investigate the food web dynamics within a New Zealand temperate mangrove/seagrass estuary. This quantitative research may contribute to the currently developing management strategies for estuaries in northern New Zealand, especially for those perceived to have expanding mangrove fringes.

Our aim is to construct a mathematical model for waves propagating through a lattice-like array of vertical cylinders, where the macro-scale variation of waves is derived from the dynamics in the micro-scale cells. Assuming infinitesimal waves, periodic lattice configuration, and strong contrast between the lattice spacing and the typical wavelength, the perturbation theory of homogenization (multiple scales) is used to derive the effective equations governing the macro-scale wave dynamics. The constitutive coefficients are computed from the solution of micro-scale boundary-value problem for a finite number of unit cells. Eddy viscosity in a unit cell is determined by balancing the time-averaged rate of dissipation and the rate of work done by wave force on the forest at a finite number of macro stations. While the spirit is similar to RANS scheme, less computational effort is needed. Using one fitting parameter, the theory is used to simulate three existing experiments with encouraging results. Limitations of the present theory are also pointed out. Â© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

It occurs in freshwater caves and in seawater in anchialine systems. It is associated with the only other stygobitic cave vertebrate in Australia, the blind cave eel, Ophisternon candidum, the world's longest cave fish, and a diverse stygofauna comprising lineages with `tethyan' tracks and widely disjunct distributions, often from North Atlantic caves. The cave gudgeon inhabits a karst wetland developed in Miocene limestones in an arid area. There is an almost complete lack of information on the basic biology of this cave fish, despite it being listed as threatened under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act. Allozyme frequencies and distributions indicate significant population sub-structuring on the Cape Range peninsula such that the populations are essentially isolated genetically suggesting that more than one biological species is present. Further, they suggest that the vicariant events may have been associated with a series of eustatic low sealevels. Analysis of intestinal contents indicates that they are opportunistic feeders, preying on stygofauna and accidentals trapped in the water, at least at the sites sampled which were open to the surface, a conclusion supported by the results of stable isotope ratio analysis. The gudgeons are found in freshwater caves and throughout deep anchialine systems in which they occur in vertically stratified water columns in which there is a polymodal distribution of water chemistries (temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen, redox, dissolved inorganic nitrogen series, hydrogen sulphide)."
"82",119880,"2021.12766","Recovery efficiency of applied and residual nitrogen fertilizer in tomatoes grown on sandy soils using the N-15 technique","Plant use efficiency of applied N is estimated to be around 50 \% for most crops. In coastal plain sandy soils particularly, leaching along with volatilization in warmer climates may be a predominant pathway for N loss to the environment. A replicated field study to determine both crop N requirement and recovery efficiency of N (REN) in tomatoes (var. BHN 602) grown on sandy soils under a plastic-mulched bed system was conducted in north Florida. Isotope labeled-ammonium nitrate ((NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15) was applied in spring at four different N rates (0, 168, 224, 280 kg N ha(-1)). A subsequent study in the fall was conducted in order to determine the recovery of residual N fertilizer in tomatoes. In spring, no appreciable response to applied fertilizer N rate above 168 kg N ha(-1) (lowest rate) were observed, indicating recommended N rates may be more than what is required. On average, approximately, 62 \% of N accumulation in the plant came from fertilizer, whereas 38 \% came from soil N. In the fall, recovery of residual N-15 fertilizer at harvest ranged from 1.9 to 5.4 kg N ha(-1). At the end of both studies, a N-15 balance was calculated to estimate total crop and soil recovery of N fertilizer, where approximately 15.4 \% of applied N-15 fertilizer was recovered. Unrecovered N in this study shows that optimizing N fertilizer management in warmer climates is critical in order to avoid unnecessary excess application of fertilizer and minimize loss of N to the environment."

Consideration of these factors early in a PMS specification process will lead to a facility power system that is fit-for-purpose, user-friendly, flexible, and reliable. This paper presents a user's perspective of PMS and is based on the authors' experiences in operating, maintaining, and modifying power management systems. It offers advice for designers and focuses on optimizing PMS at oil and gas production and processing facilities, both onshore and offshore, at which the power system is islanded (i.e. all electricity is self-generated and there is no external source of supply). This first-part paper provides design considerations focused on PMS interaction with generators themselves. More specifically, topics are covered such as frequency control, voltage control, active power sharing, reactive power sharing, waste heat recovery, engine driver reliability, distributed generation, sub-island management, and engine control interface. Not all these factors will apply in every situation, but this paper will provide a practical list of design factors to consider when planning and determining performance specifications for new power management systems. (A future second-part paper is anticipated which will provide design considerations for PMS functions that are not related to generator management.)"
"84",294162,"1986.2145","Earth Radiation Budget data and climate research","An overview is presented of the uses of top of the atmosphere radiation budget measurements in studies of climate. The net radiative energy flux at the top of the atmosphere must be balanced by local heat storage in the earthâ€atmosphere column or by horizontal transport in the atmosphere and ocean. Regional variations in the components of the radiation balance are significant and place important constraints on regional and global climate. If suitable time averaging is applied, regional net radiation can be used to infer horizontal transport of energy in the atmosphere and ocean. Estimates of equatorâ€toâ€pole transport in the atmosphere and ocean based upon currently available topâ€ofâ€atmosphere radiation budget measurements contain unacceptably large uncertainties associated with uncertainties in the radiation budget measurements themselves. Diurnal and interannual variations in regional radiation balances are large and important but have not yet been properly sampled with broadband instruments. Both have the potential for providing important insights into climate. The role of cloudiness in climate sensitivity remains one of the major uncertainties in quantitative estimates of climate changes associated with particular perturbing influences. Radiation budget data can be used to estimate the effects of actual cloudiness on the topâ€ofâ€atmosphere heat balance and the dependence of these effects on location and season. The observational studies of the effect of cloudiness on the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere that have been completed to date all suffer from one or more of three fundamental problems. These are that the parameters of the cloudiness are not accurately known, the radiation budget data are not based on measurements whose frequency response is unbiased in relation to the emissions of the sun and the earth, and the diurnal sampling of the measurements is not complete. The uncertainties associated with each of these problems are expected to be reduced as a result of analyses based on data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment. In order that quantitative estimates of climate change be as accurate as possible the general circulation models (GCMs) which produce these forecasts must be critically evaluated with observed data. Many of the most important mechanisms for perturbing climate (e.g., CO2, volcanic aerosols, surface albedo changes) and many of the most important feedback processes (e.g., relative humidity feedback, cloud feedback, iceâ€albedo feedback) directly involve the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere and its relation to surface climate. Since the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere can, in principle, be measured very accurately from space, it is natural that the simulation of topâ€ofâ€atmosphere energy fluxes by GCMs should be carefully validated against observations. Because of the complexities introduced by clouds, a complete validation of the radiation budget of a GCM is a long and difficult task. A strategy is suggested here in which the clearâ€sky fluxes of the model are first compared with a clearâ€sky radiation budget climatology derived from observations. The radiation budgets with clouds included can then also be compared. This procedure should isolate problems not associated with cloudiness and indicate whether, in the grossest sense, the model clouds are correctly influencing the radiation balance. Comparisons between instantaneous synoptic maps of the radiation budget components and numerical forecasts can also be used to diagnose the performance of models.

"85",239571,"2009.5213","Species identity, diversity and microbial carbon flow in reassembling macrobenthic communities","Intense disturbance may locally destroy patches of habitat and shape the landscape into a mosaic of reassembling communities. The development of ecosystem properties during such community reassembly is poorly understood. In intertidal bare sediments, trophic relations between microphytobenthos or heterotrophic bacteria and macrofauna invertebrates may guarantee fundamental ecosystem properties such as carbon flow through the food web. We studied the dynamic relation between reassembling macrofauna communities and such microbial carbon flow during recovery after severe disturbance. We deliberately induced prolonged hypoxia in winter and early summer and allowed recolonisation for periods of two and five months. Carbon flow was quantified from basal resources (microphytobenthos and bacteria) to intermediate consumers using C-13 as a tracer. Within the period of study (5 months), microbial carbon flow fully recovered, although macrofauna diversity was still very low compared to the natural communities (ranging from 6 to 17 species). More than 90\% of microbial carbon flow to macrofauna was due to the consumers that recolonised within two months. Two of these species were dominant contributors to microphytobenthos carbon transfer to fauna. Furthermore, at an early stage of reassembly, this ecosystem property was remarkably similar when disturbance took place at different times of the year (winter or early summer), although there were differences in assemblage composition and functional diversity. We conclude that species assemblages and ecosystem function developed relatively independently in this benthic system. We discuss which ecological factors may have caused such non-parallel development of macrofaunal communities and carbon flow."
"86",132542,"2018.8784","Developing indicators and a baseline for monitoring demersal fish in data-poor, offshore Marine Parks using probabilistic sampling","The number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) has increased globally as concerns over the impact that human activities are having on the world's oceans have also increased. Monitoring is a key requirement to determine if MPAs are meeting their objectives. However, many recently declared MPA's are large, offshore, or form part of an expansive network and spatial information about the habitats, communities and species that they contain is often lacking. This presents challenges for deciding exactly what to monitor and developing strategies on how to monitor it efficiently. Here we examine these issues using the Flinders Marine Park in Australia as a case study. We trial a two-stage version of a spatially-balanced, probabilistic sampling design combined with Baited Remote Underwater Videos (BRUVs) to perform an initial inventory, and we evaluate the potential of six commercially and ecologically important demersal fish as indicators within the Marine Park. Using this approach we were able to (1) quantitatively describe the distribution of the fish species in the Marine Park; (2) establish quantitative and representative estimates of their abundance throughout the Marine Park to serve as a baseline for future monitoring; (3) conduct power analyses to estimate the magnitude of increase we may be able to detect with feasible levels of sampling effort. Power analysis suggested{''} that for most of our potential indicator species, detecting increases in abundance as small as 50\% from present values should be feasible if sampling is restricted to a species' preferred habitat and the same sites are sampled through time. Our approach is transferrable to other regions where monitoring programs must be designed based on limited spatial and biological data, assisting with decisions on what and how to monitor."

This study examines the influence of familial risk for PD on CO(2) responses in children with SAD. We hypothesized that offspring with SAD of parents with PD would have distinct CO(2) responses. Methods: Two hundred twelve 9- to 20-year-old offspring of parents with or without PD were exposed to maintained 5\% CO(2) inhalation in the participants' homes. Anxiety symptoms, panic attacks, and respiratory physiology (respiratory frequency and tidal volume) were monitored during baseline and 15-min maintained CO(2) breathing. Results: As hypothesized, significant offspring SAD x parent PD interactions were obtained for anxiety symptoms, respiratory frequency, tidal volume, and a panting index during CO(2) inhalation. Offspring with both SAD and parental PD exhibited more anxiety symptoms at termination of 5\% CO(2) breathing than the other offspring groups and had the most extreme values on measures of respiratory physiology. Conclusions: Youth with both SAD and parental PD have respiratory responses to CO(2) similar to adult PD. They might be a subtype of SAD at particularly high risk for adult PD."
"88",26002,"1999.443","Interpreting carbon-isotope excursions: carbonates and organic matter","Variations in the carbon isotopic compositions of marine carbonate and organic carbon provide a record of changes in the fraction of organic carbon buried through time and may provide clues to changes in rates of weathering and sources of organic carbon. Paired carbonate and organic carbon isotope determinations provide a possibility of interpreting not only changes in the global carbon cycle through time, but changes in atmospheric pCO(2) as well. Interpretations of these types of data are typically rather qualitative; a quantitative basis is required to develop a better understanding of changes in the carbon cycle. For this purpose, we employ a simple model of the global carbon cycle which is subjected to a number of different perturbations, each lasting 500 ky, i.e., much longer than the residence times of carbon and phosphorus in the ocean-atmosphere system. In addition to standard considerations of carbon mass and isotopic fluxes to the ocean-atmosphere system from weathering and volcanism and fluxes of organic carbon and carbonate-carbon to sediments, the model ;incorporates sensitivity of the photosynthetic carbon isotope effect to changes in pCO(2). The inclusion of this parameter leads to unexpected carbon isotope responses to forcing that causes increased rates of organic carbon burial. A series of simple to more complex simulations illustrates the significant effects of varying differences between the carbon isotopic composition of sedimented carbonate and organic carbon (Delta(B)). With constant Delta(B) a 50\% increase in organic carbon burial produces a parallel increase in carbonate and organic carbon isotopic compositions. However, the same simulation with Delta(B) responsive to pCO(2) changes produces an initial parallel delta(13)C increase, but this is followed by an even greater C-13-enrichment in organic carbon because pCO(2) falls in response to increased organic carbon burial. The counterintuitive overall result of the enhanced organic carbon burial event is that the carbonate carbon isotopic composition actually decreases because of the more substantial increase in delta(13)C(org). In addition, we illustrate the effects on carbon isotopic compositions of the oceanic inorganic carbon reservoir and buried organic matter of a 50\% increase in volcanic CO2 outgassing, a 50\% increase in weathering rate (with coupled phosphate and riverine carbon flux responses), a 50\% decrease in shale-associated organic carbon weathering, a 50\% decrease in silicate weathering rate, and the possible effects of the rise in abundance of C-4 plants in the late Miocene to Recent. We compare the model simulated carbon isotopic responses for some of these experiments to paired carbonate- and organic-carbon records to illustrate how these records might be interpreted in light of the model response.

We applied a suite of geochemical indicators including the Rock Eval parameters, traditionally used for the matured OM characterization, and terrestrial lipid biomarkers. In addition, we analyzed a comprehensive grain size data in order to assess hydrodynamic sedimentation regime across the LS shelf. Rock-Eval (RE) data characterize LS sedimentary OM with generally low hydrogen index (100â€“200 mg HC/g TOC) and oxygen index (200 and 300 CO2 /g TOC) both increasing off to the continental slope. According to Tpeak values, there is a clear regional distinction between two groups (369â€“401â—¦ C for the inner and mid shelf; 451â€“464â—¦ C for the outer shelf). We suggest that permafrost-derived OM is traced across the shallow and mid depths with high Tpeak and slightly elevated HI values if compared to other Arctic continental margins. Molecular-based degradation indicators show a trend to more degraded terrestrial OC with increasing distance from the coast corroborating with RE results. However, we observed much less variation of the degradation markers down to the deeper sampling horizons, which supports the notion that the most active OM degradation in LS land-shelf system takes part during the cross-shelf transport, not while getting buried deeper.

Groundwater discharge in the marsh was measured with a network of nested piezometers. Hydrological modelling of the wetland showed that a water volume of 770,000 m(3) yr(-1) is discharging into the marsh, but that this water flux essentially takes place along the lateral borders of the wetland. However, this natural discharge volume represents only 20\% of the artificial freshwater injected each year into the wetland to maintain the water level close to the soil surface. Understanding and quantifying the groundwater component in wetland hydrology is crucial for wetland management and conservation."

Utilization ofmangrove forest with silvofishery system can be an alternative developed for the community around the conservation areas. The purpose of this research is to know the strength of social capital in supporting the utilization of mangrove for silvofishery. This research adopted Social Capital Assessment Tool (SCAT) method and data analysis with Partial Least Square- Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results of the study found that there are several elements of social capital in five study villages that have not supported silvofishery in KNP, east Kalimantan, Indonesia. The overall analysis of the respondents showed that there are five elements of social capital have significant effect on silvofishery. Then the other two elements are insignificant and should be ofparticular concern to be improved, ie social networks and social norms. Indicators to be aware of are the increased knowledge of communities on park-related regulations, increased involvement of individuals in the community and the strengthening ofpublic figures who can be role models for the community. Mangrove forest of KNP should be kept as conservation area, but it should still pay attention to the socio-economic conditions of the surrounding community. The strength ofsocial capital is expected to realize conservation-based economic development."

The volume fraction of retained austenite is distinctly high at similar to 30\% in 0.5 wt.\% C TRIP steel compared to the conventional TRIP steels (10-20\%) while the morphologies of retained austenite are mainly film-like, mixed film-like and small blocky (0.3-0.7 mu m), and large blocky (0.7-1.5 mu m), respectively, in the steels after bainitic holding at 360 degrees C, 400 degrees C and 450 degrees C. In addition, the volume fraction of bainite decreases from 53 vol.\% to 44 vol.\% and 32 vol.\%, and that of martensite-austenite island/fresh martensite content increases from 2 vol.\% to 9 vol.\% and 21 vol.\% with increasing temperatures. The two-stage mechanical stability of retained austenite with large volume fraction and mixed film-like and blocky morphologies ensures stable and continuous TRIP effect. As a result, after bainitic holding at 400 degrees C for 30 min, the superiorly comprehensive mechanical properties are obtained for the steel, showing ultrahigh tensile strength of 1220 MPa and retaining good ductility of 44\%. Moreover, the effects of multiphase on strength and ductility were discussed and the presences of martensite-austenite island/fresh martensite and blocky retained austenite lead to premature crack initiation. Crack initiation and propagation mainly happen along the interface between deformation-induced martensite and the ferritic matrix and that between M-A island/FM and the ferritic matrix. The decreasing carbon content in RA and the occurrence as well as increase of M-A island/FM can deteriorate corrosion resistance of 0.5 wt.\% C TRIP steels."

The harmonic variation of benthic delta(18)O in surface sediments with water depth and temperature implies that the temperature is the main factor influencing benthic delta(18)O variations. Planktonic delta(18)O fluctuates with sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS). The N-S temperature gradient results in planktonic delta(18)O decreasing from the northeast to the south. Cool, saline waters driven by the winter monsoon are interpreted to have been responsible for the high delta(18)O values in the northeast SCS. The East Asian monsoons not only brim nutrients into the South China Sea and maintain high nutrient concentration levels at the southwestern and northeastern ends. which cause depleted delta(13)C both in planktonic (surface) and benthic (bottom) samples but also reduce planktonic/benthic delta(18)O differences. The distribution of delta(18)O and delta(13)C in the surface and LGM samples are strikingly similar. indicating that the impact of SST and SSS has been maintained, and nutrient inputs, mainly from the northeastern and southwestern ends, have been controlled by monsoons since the LGM. Comparisons of the modem and LGM delta(18)O indicate a difference of about 3.6degreesC in bottom-water temperature and a large surface-to-bottom temperature gradient during the LGM as compared to today (C) 2004 Elsevier BY.

The Be-10 spikes do not coincide precisely with peaks in carbonate content and grainsize, or with changes in bulk rock chemical composition. Rather, they appear in the sequence a Little above the base of each cyclothem, at the presumed location of the local flooding surface (LFS). They therefore originated in response to seafloor sediment starvation during transgression, and not from ice sheet melting, biogenic scavenging or geomagnetic intensity changes, as has been suggested previously for Be-10 spikes in some deep-sea or continental margin sequences.

Using secondary data collected on offshore wind turbines and electrically powered vehicles, the analysis allows a determination of actual quantities of rare earths used within their generators, electric motors, and batteries. The results of this chapter disprove the widespread allegation that availability risk impedes the deployment of offshore wind. Contrary to this, a potential supply shortage would disrupt further development of the automotive industry and its electrification. Uncertainty about volatile prices and the threat of supply shortages induce manufacturers to shift from superior rare earth-intensive topologies, ultimately rendering innovation in these economically nonviable.

"97",250749,"2022.7111","Engineering coastal structures to centrally embrace biodiversity","Global environmental factors (e.g., extreme weather, climate action failure, natural disasters, human environmental damage) increasingly threaten coastal com-munities. Shorelines are often hardened (seawalls, bulkheads) to prevent flooding and erosion and protect coastal communities. However, hardened shorelines lead to environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. Developmental pressures that are growing in scale, scope, and complexity necessitate the development of sustainable solutions to work with, rather than against, nature. Such nature-based solutions (NBS) provide protection and improve environmental quality and enhance biodiversity. To further this pressing need into action, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) began the Engineering With Nature (EWN) initiative to balance economic, environmental, and social benefits through collaboration with partners and stakeholders. This work shows how engineering practice can be advanced through structured decision-making and landscape architecture renderings that include ecological sciences and NBS into an integrated approach for enhancing biodiversity in coastal marine environments. This integrated approach can be applied when designing new infrastructure projects or modifying or repairing existing infrastructure. To help communicate designs incorporating NBS, drawings, and renderings showcasing EWN concepts can aid decision-making. Our experiences with implementing EWN in practice have revealed that involving landscape architects can play a crucial role in successful collaboration and lead to solutions that protect coastal communities while preserving or enhancing biodiversity."
"98",51907,"2008.1458","The changing landscape: ecosystem responses to urbanization and pollution across climatic and societal gradients","Urbanization, an important driver of climate change and pollution, alters both biotic and abiotic ecosystem properties within, surrounding, and even at great distances from urban areas. As a result, research challenges and environmental problems must be tackled at local, regional, and global scales. Ecosystem responses to land change are complex and interacting, occurring on all spatial and temporal scales as a consequence of connectivity of resources, energy, and information among social, physical, and biological systems. We propose six hypotheses about local to continental effects of urbanization and pollution, and an operational research approach to test them. This approach focuses on analysis of ``megapolitan{''} areas that have emerged across North America, but also includes diverse wildland-to-urban gradients and spatially continuous coverage of land change. Concerted and coordinated monitoring of land change and accompanying ecosystem responses, coupled with simulation models, will permit robust forecasts of how land change and human settlement patterns will alter ecosystem services and resource utilization across the North American continent. This, in turn, can be applied globally."
"99",128292,"2021.14996","Structural Recovery of Logged Forests in the Solomon Islands: Implications for Conservation and Management","Much of the lowland tropical forests in the Solomon Islands have been heavily logged. However, little is known about the recovery status of these forests. We examined factors that influenced the recovery of forest structural attributes within 50 years after selective logging on Kolombangara Island in the western Solomon Islands. Twelve study sites-six logged and six unlogged-were identified across the Island, with two logged sites in each of three recovery-time classes: 10, 30, and 50 years after logging. Within each study site, 12 0.1-ha plots were randomly established, and a series of forest attributes measured in each plot. Our results revealed that local logging intensity and soil attributes have stronger influence on forest-structural recovery than do site attributes such as local topography or tree architecture. Furthermore, half a century of regeneration following logging is insufficient to permit full recovery of forest structure. We conclude that logged forests on Kolombangara and possibly across the Solomon Islands may not fully recover structurally before the next logging cycle, in the absence of a policy on re-entry harvesting. The development of such a policy coupled with robust forest-management measures is pivotal to facilitating sustainable logging while supporting biodiversity conservation in the Solomon Islands. This may be the last best hope for saving lowland forests and their biodiversity on this unique tropical archipelago."

One recovery strategy is to restore tidal wetlands, thereby increasing productivity and prey abundance. However, the link between tidal wetlands and foraging of delta smelt is not yet established. Using GIS, we quantified the area of tidal wetlands (km(2)) within a 2-km radius around sampling stations from which 1380 delta smelt were collected over 4years (2011-2015). We quantified stomach fullness, a metric of foraging success, for each fish and regressed it against tidal wetland area, turbidity, water temperature, and other factors known to influence foraging success of delta smelt. Stomach fullness increased with both increasing tidal wetland area and increasing water temperature and was reduced at turbidities >80NTU. Model estimates show that stomach fullness increased twofold from the minimum (0km(2)) to the maximum (4.89km(2)) tidal wetland area. Of this increase, 60\% was due to increased predation on larval fish, while 40\% was due to increased predation on zooplankton. Delta smelt collected from areas with the highest tidal wetland area were six times more likely to have a larval fish in their guts than those collected from areas with the lowest. Thus, tidal wetland appears to confer substantial benefits to the foraging success of delta smelt, mainly via increased predation on larval fish."
