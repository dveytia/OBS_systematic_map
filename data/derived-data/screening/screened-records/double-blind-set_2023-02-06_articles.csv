To operationalize coastal wetland ecosystem services for decision-making, there is a need to clarify how salt marshes and mangroves function in this region. The goal of this research is to operationalize blue carbon (carbon stored in coastal habitats) within the Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve, TX by documenting what we know about blue carbon within the study area, identifying data gaps and future research needs, and using available knowledge to inform management and decision-making within the Reserve. Our research shows that there is a lack of data within the Reserve on mangrove aboveground biomass, belowground biomass and soil carbon and on salt marsh soil carbon. There is also a dearth of information on wetland carbon sequestration and emission rates within the Reserve, making it challenging to inform management and develop a market for blue carbon.",0.964

We review drivers of its population dynamics in relation to management. Springtime upwelling intensity lagged by 2 years co-varied positively with CSNA biomass, as did the abundance of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax; weakly negative). CSNA population dynamics indicate the need for a multi-species stock assessment, but given serious challenges with modelling population collapse and recovery dynamics, and its moderate fisheries, we suggest that sensible management could be a simple 2-tier harvest control rule designed to emphasize the key trophic role of CSNA in the ecosystem while maintaining moderate socio-economic services. We recommend a monitoring fishery of no more than 5 KMT year(-1) split between central and southern California when the stock falls below the long-term median abundance estimate of 380 KMT across the California portion of its range, and a catch limit of 25 KMT year(-1) when the stock is above this reference point. This rule would be precautionary, serving to maintain the most important small pelagic forage in the ecosystem, various fisheries interests, and information streams when the population is in a collapsed state.",0.326

Does water warming drive a sponge diversity increasing in the Mediterranean Sea?,JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM,"Costa, Gabriele; Bavestrello, Giorgio; Micaroni, Valerio; Pansini, Maurizio; Strano, Francesca; Bertolino, Marco","Climate change and heavy anthropic pressures are giving rise to important modifications in the rocky benthic communities of the Mediterranean Sea. In particular, sponge assemblages have been deeply affected due to the susceptibility of some species to dramatic phenomena such as mass mortalities or widespread variations in the abundance of other species. For this reason, long-term biodiversity monitoring of the sponge assemblages is important for understanding the direction of changes over time. We studied the sponge fauna living off Tricase Porto (Otranto Strait) and compared its composition with the results of a study conducted in the same area 50 years ago. The comparison indicated that the sponge diversity of this area has strongly increased in the last 50 years and a large number of the sponges recorded in the old survey are still present in the recent community. This evidence matches with other results obtained from different localities of the Mediterranean Sea indicating an increase of sponge diversity, possibly due to the present water warming.

K. G. P.; Piyadasa, R. U. K.","Land degradation in coastal areas due to seawater intrusion, and coastal salinity is one of the major critical problems affecting the sustainable development of Sri Lanka. Coastal salinity risk is increasing in the Bentota area while diminishing land productivity which results in poor food production and giving rise to several socio-economic issues for the community in the area. Bentota is below the agricultural production capacity level and no strategy has been implemented or introduced so far regarding the utilisation of degraded lands in the area. This study identified the optimised extent of salinized lands for paddy, coconut, vegetables, fruits, tea, rubber and cinnamon cultivations based on future coastal salinity effects, land use demand and the development trend of the area. Land use change, rainfall, temperature, topography, floods, soil, ground and surface water are the factors applied in evaluations of land use suitability as the prior requirement for land use optimisation. Future demands of land use were predicted applying population growth models, the theory of land carrying capacity and the ecological footprint. Strategies for optimising the productivity of salinized lands were identified using a stakeholder perception-based approach. The developed sustainable land use pattern will enhance the land productivity of highly (3.4 \%), moderately (39.6 \%) and slightly (57 \%) salinized areas in Bentota. Identified land management strategies will facilitate the spatial planning of future land use of this area by providing guidance to the local authority in the process of allocating salinized lands for enhancing land productivity.",0.810

However, there is limited information on the extent to which populations are connected or how multiple disturbances affect connectivity, especially in coastal and marine ecosystems. We used network analysis and the outputs of a biophysical model to measure potential functional connectivity and predict the impact of multiple disturbances on seagrasses in the central Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), Australia. The seagrass networks were densely connected, indicating that seagrasses are resilient to the random loss of meadows. Our analysis identified discrete meadows that are important sources of seagrass propagules and that serve as stepping stones connecting various different parts of the network. Several of these meadows were close to urban areas or ports and likely to be at risk from coastal development. Deep water meadows were highly connected to coastal meadows and may function as a refuge, but only for non-foundation species. We evaluated changes to the structure and functioning of the seagrass networks when one or more discrete meadows were removed due to multiple disturbance events. The scale of disturbance required to disconnect the seagrass networks into two or more components was on average >245km, about half the length of the metapopulation. The densely connected seagrass meadows of the central GBRWHA are not limited by the supply of propagules; therefore, management should focus on improving environmental conditions that support natural seagrass recruitment and recovery processes. Our study provides a new framework for assessing the impact of global change on the connectivity and persistence of coastal and marine ecosystems. Without this knowledge, management actions, including coastal restoration, may prove unnecessary and be unsuccessful.",0.132

The younger and more volcanically active Canary Islands, El Hierro, La Palma and Tenerife, show the clearest evidence of recent landslide activity. The evidence includes landslide scars on the island flanks, debris deposits on the lower island slopes, and volcaniclastic turbidites on the floor of the adjacent ocean basins. At least 14 large landslides have occurred on the flanks of the El Hierro, La Palma and Tenerife, the majority of these in the last 1 million years, with the youngest, on the northwest flank of El Hierro, as recent as 15 thousand years in age. Older landslides undoubtedly occurred, but are difficult to quantify because the evidence is buried beneath younger volcanic rocks and sediments. Landslides on the Canary Island flanks can be categorised as debris avalanches, slumps or debris flows. Debris avalanches are long runout catastrophic failures which typically affect only the superficial part of the island volcanic sequence, up to a maximum thickness of 1 to 2 km. They are the commonest type of landslide mapped. In contrast, slumps move short distances and are deep-rooted landslides which may affect the entire thickness of the volcanic edifice. Debris flows are defined as landslides which primarily affect the sedimentary cover of the submarine island flanks. Some landslides are complex events involving more than one of the above end-member processes. Individual debris avalanches have volumes in the range of 50-500 km(3), cover several thousand km(2) of seafloor, and have runout distances of up to 130 km from source. Overall, debris avalanche deposits account for about 10\% of the total volcanic edifices of the small, relatively young islands of El Hierro and La Palma. Some parameters, such as deposit volumes and landslide ages, are difficult to quantify. The key characteristics of debris avalanches include a relatively narrow headwall and chute above 3000 m water depth on the island flanks, broadening into a depositional lobe below 3000 m. Debris avalanche deposits have a typically blocky morphology, with individual blocks up to a kilometre or more in diameter, However, considerable variation exists between different avalanche deposits. At one extreme, the El Golfo debris avalanche on El Hierro has few large blocks scattered randomly across the avalanche surface. At the other, Icod on the north flank of Tenerife has much more numerous but smaller blocks over most of its surface, with a few very large blocks confined to the margins of the deposit. Icod also exhibits flow structures (longitudinal shears and pressure ridges) that are absent in El Golfo. The primary controls on the block structure and distribution are inferred to be related to the nature of the landslide material and to flow processes. Observations in experimental debris flows show that the differences between the El Golfo and Icod landslide deposits are probably controlled by the greater proportion of fine grained material in the Icod landslide. This, in turn, relates to the nature of the failed volcanic rocks, which are almost entirely basalt on EI Hierro but include a much greater proportion of pyroclastic deposits on Tenerife. Landslide occurrence appears to be primarily controlled by the locations of volcanic rift zones on the islands, with landslides propagating perpendicular to the rift orientation. However, this does not explain the uneven distribution of landslides on some islands which seems to indicate that unstable flanks are a `weakness' that can be carried forward during island development. This may occur because certain island flanks are steeper, extend to greater water depths or are less buttressed by the surrounding topography, and because volcanic production following a landslide my be concentrated in the landslide scar, thus focussing subsequent landslide potential in this area. Landslides are primarily a result of volcanic construction to a point where the mass of volcanic products fails under its own weight. Although the actual triggering factors are poorly understood, they may include or be influenced by dyke intrusion, pore pressure changes related to intrusion, seismicity or sealevel/climate changes. A possible relationship between caldera collapse and landsliding on Tenerife is not, in our interpretation, supported by the available evidence. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Exploration of oil and gas over the past six decades in the Arctic has made the region as places in the world. All major players in the market have endeavored to approach this new energy basket to utilize its maximum benefit. Commercial exploitation of natural resources has made this place a center for the regulation of oil and gas activities. However, petroleum exploration and its operation have had significant local detrimental impacts on the atmosphere, inhabitants and marine environment. Geologists have always believed in the huge reserves of oil and gas in the Arctic Region. However, the exploration of oil and gas started as recently as the mid-1950s. An increase in the demand of oil and gas in the international market, as well as its growing scarcity, compelled the world to locate oil and gas reserves in various regions. It is significant to note that the Arctic states are strategically going to control the excessive exploitation of Arctic hydrocarbon with much profitability. However, it is still a far sighted question `whether Arctic will provide direct competition to the Middle East' and become another hub in the energy market.",0.048

H.; Lee, Myong-In; Kim, Ganghan; Kim, Dongmin; Park, Jong-Hwa; Choi, Sung-Deuk; Cho, Gi-Hyoug","This study applied the American Meteorological Society and Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) to assess the risk caused by an accidental release and dispersion of the toxic chemical benzene in the vicinity of a highly populated urban area. The modeling domain encompasses the Korean megacity of Ulsan, which includes two national industrial complexes and is characterized by a complex coastal terrain. Multiple AERMOD simulations were conducted for an assumed emission scenario using background wind data from August between 2009 and 2013. The series of experiments produced the spatial accident probability patterns for different concentration levels during daytime and nighttime scenarios based on the corresponding dominant wind patterns. This study further quantifies the potential accident risk based on the number of affected individuals by combining the accident probability with the indoor and outdoor population estimates. The chemical gas dispersion characteristics depend on various local meteorological conditions, such as the land-sea breeze direction, which alternates between daytime and nighttime, and the atmospheric stability. The results reveal that benzene dispersion affects a much larger area during the nighttime owing to the presence of a nocturnal stable boundary layer with significant temperature stratification. The affected area is smaller during the daytime owing to decreased stability and enhanced vertical mixing in the boundary layer. The results include a high degree of uncertainty during the nighttime owing to weak wind speeds and the lack of a prevailing wind direction, which impact the vulnerable area. However, vulnerable areas are More effectively identified during the daytime, when more consistent meteorological conditions exist. However, the potential risk becomes much lower during the nighttime owing to a substantial reduction of the outdoor population. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",0.044

Our study examines the range of research approaches and findings regarding the role of green roofs in mitigating urban heat and enhancing human comfort. This review provides an overview of 89 studies conducted in three main climate types (hot-humid, temperate, and dry), from 2000 till 2020. All of the reviewed studies confirm the cooling effect of green roofs and its contribution to reduced heat island intensity regardless of the background climatic condition. However, dry climate has the highest (3 degrees C) median cooling effect of green roofs among all the climates investigated. Hot- humid climate presents the lowest cooling potential (median = 1 degrees C) of green roofs among all the climate types. Moreover, green roofs contribute a median surface temperature reduction of 30 degrees C in hot-humid cities. This value is relatively low for temperate climates (28 degrees C). Notably, no study has examined the impact of green roofs on surface temperature reduction in dry climates. This review can benefit urban planners and various stakeholders. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

91759614,https://sysrev.com/p/121334/article/91759614,Carbon sequestration and storage in Norwegian Arctic coastal wetlands: Impacts of climate change,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Ward, Raymond D.","Coastal wetlands contain some of the largest stores of pedologic and biotic carbon pools, and climate change is likely to influence the ability of these ecosystems to sequester carbon. Recent studies have attempted to provide data on carbon sequestration in both temperate and tropical coastal wetlands. Alteration of Arctic wetland carbon sequestration rates is also likely where coastal forcing mechanisms interact directly with these coastal systems. At present there are no data available to provide a detailed understanding of present day and historical carbon sequestration rates within Arctic coastal wetlands. In order to address this knowledge gap, rates of carbon sequestration were assessed within five Arctic coastal wetland sites in Norway. This was undertaken using radiometric dating techniques (Pb-210 and Cs-132) to establish a geochronology for recent wetland development, and soil carbon stocks were estimated from cores. Average carbon sequestration rates were varied, both between sites and over time, ranging between 19 and 603 g C m(2) y(-1), and these were correlated with increases in the length of the growing season. Stocks ranged between 3.67 and 13.79 Mg C ha(-1), which is very low compared with global average estimations for similar coastal systems, e.g. 250 Mg C ha(-1) for temperate salt marshes, 280 Mg C ha(-1) for mangroves, and 140 Mg C ha(-1) for seagrasses. This is most likely due to isostatic uplift and sediment accretion historically outpacing sea level rise, which results in wetland progradation and thus a continuous formation of new marsh with thin organic soil horizons. However, with increasing rates of sea level rise it is uncertain whether this trend is set to continue or be reversed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0.143

This paper reviews the causes and consequences of coastal flooding in European Mediterranean countries, common and advanced solutions implemented to mitigate flood risk, and the importance of stakeholder involvement in developing these solutions. Climate change, intensive urbanization, tourism, deforestation, wildfires, and erosion are the main causes of coastal flooding, leading to social and economic losses, degradation of ecosystems, and water and soil contamination due to saltwater intrusion. Various measures for mitigating urban coastal flooding have been implemented, including coastal barriers, infrastructural drainage systems, wetlands, and mobile dams. Development and implementation of such solutions should be performed in close collaboration with stakeholders, but their current engagement at the coordination and/or decision-making level does not allow full integration of local knowledge in flood mitigation projects. Various processes are used to engage stakeholders in coastal flood mitigation, but participatory approaches are required to integrate their perspectives into performance analysis of potential solutions. Such approaches would allow a balance to be reached between nature conservation, market forces, stakeholder needs, and decision-makers' priorities, resulting in development of innovative and sustainable mitigation solutions to enhance urban resilience to coastal flooding.",0.940

Design/methodology/approach A participatory process involving the community and institutional stakeholders was carried out to select and prioritise adaptation measures to reduce the erosion of sandy beaches, dunes and bluffs due to extreme wind storm surge and rainfall, SLR and mismanagement practices. The recovery of coastal ecosystems was implemented through soft measures (green infrastructure) such as revegetation with native species, dune regeneration, sustainable drainage systems and the reduction of use pressures. Findings Main achievements of this case study include capacity building of municipal staff and stakeholders, knowledge exchanges with national-level decision makers and scientists and the incorporation of EbA approaches by subnational-level coastal governments. To consolidate EbA, the local government introduced innovations in the coastal management institutional structure. Originality/value The outcomes of the article include, besides the increase in the resilience of social-ecological systems, the strengthening of socio-institutional behaviour, structure and sustainability. This experience provides insights for developing a strategy for both Integrated Coastal Management and climate adaptation at the national scale.",0.767

I.; Ma, Ruiqu","The rapid proliferation of smart city (SC) projects is a response to the challenges posed by rapid urbanization such as energy shortage, economic reconstruction (the drive towards higher productivity and efficiency) and demographic increase. Ubiquitous information communication technologies (ICTs) in SCs enable people to understand and manage cities more efficiently and sustainably, thus improving their life quality. However, a number of potential pitfalls have been noted in the development of SC. This study aims at identifying potential pitfalls in the development of SCs and filling a knowledge gap in this domain. Based on an extensive literature review, four major pitfalls are categorized as system information insecurity, personal privacy leakage, information islands, and digital divide. Possible causes and adverse effects of these pitfalls are discussed with the aid of three international case reviews. In addition, this study looks into existing assessment schemes of SC performance that are mainly focused on the positive and functional capability, but sparingly evaluate the possible downsides. It is argued that a SC cannot claim to be successful by solely measuring how much it has done or what it aims to achieve. While most studies focus on the benefits of SCs, this research reveals the challenges facing city planners. It contributes to the body of knowledge in this regard and also provides an insight into the subject matter. A framework for conducting further research on mitigating potential SC pitfalls has been laid. It is intended to inform practitioners, researchers and policymakers to develop proactive solutions concerning both technological and non-technological aspects at an early stage of SC developments.",0.325

A significant difference between these methodologies consists of their different energy requirements, i.e., thermal energy for MSF and mechanical energy for RO plants. The presence of both desalination systems (MSF and RO) appears to be suitable for cogeneration plants. The reject heat from the power cycle can feed an MSF section, while some power feeds the RO section and the MSF auxiliary equipment; the rest is sold to the grid. A criterion for the optimal design of such tri-functional cogeneration plants is proposed, based on exergo-economics and on profit maximization. In particular, in this work the analytical model is presented by examining the required data, expressing the physical and cost balances and furnishing a comprehensive definition of the objective function.

These systems are formed by canopy-forming macroalgae (Laminariales, Tilopteridales, and Fucales) of high ecological value that provide numerous ecosystem services. These key species are also indicators of good environmental status. In recent decades, marine forests have been threatened by different impacts of local and global origin, putting their stability and survival in question. On a global scale, in many temperate areas of the planet, marine forests have been replaced by ``sea-urchins barrens.{''} We present a general overview of sea-urchins' population status in the archipelagos of Azores, Webbnesia (Madeira, Selvagens, and Canary Islands) and Cabo Verde, focusing on their role in the maintenance of the so-called ``alternate stable state.{''} After an in-depth evaluation of the different anthropogenic and environmental pressures, we conclude that sea-urchins population explosion has been facilitated in the benthic habitats of Madeira and Canary Islands, preventing the recovery of canopy-forming macroalgae assemblages and being one of the main drivers in maintaining a stable barren state. Diadema africanum is the main barrens-forming species in Webbnesia, where it reaches high densities and strongly impacts macroalgal assemblages. On the other hand, in the most pristine areas, such as the Selvagens Islands and other Marine Protected Areas from the Canary Islands, the density of D. africanum is up to 65\% lower than in the nearby Madeira Island, and macroalgal communities are preserved in good status. This information is critical for marine environmental management, highlighting the urgent need for implementation of appropriate control mechanisms and restoration actions headed to the conservation of marine forests in Macaronesian archipelagos.",0.900

However, the joint effect of factors influencing ESV is ignored, which is an important way for influencing factors to work in the complex and frequently interacting ecosystem. In this study, we used remote sensing data, grid statistics data, and machine learning methods to reveal the spatiotemporal variation of ESV and to explore the combined effects of influencing factors in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) from 2000 to 2015. The specific results were as follows. (1) The total ESV in the GBA decreased by 13.11 billion yuan with the rate of decline slowing over the study period, and the regulating service suffered the most damage. (2) The spatial distribution of ESV has an outer high and inner low circle structure. Compared with that of the west bank of the Pearl River estuary, ESV of the east bank is relatively lower. (3) The three kinds of combination of factors had different impacts on ecosystem services. The effect of land-use integrity on ecosystem services is opposite between natural ecosystem and urban ecosystem. (2)When regional population density is under a certain threshold (669 people/km(2)), social economies and ecosystems may develop together. (3)The mismatched hydrothermal conditions can lead to a decrease in ESV. The findings of our study are conducive to identifying the current situation of ecosystem services and promoting the ecological civilization construction in the GBA, and bring a new insight and perspective on the influencing mechanisms of ESV.

L.; Guerra, J. A.; Armas-Herrera, C. M.; Arbelo, C. D.; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, A.","It has been recognised that volcanic soils, particularly Andosols, can store large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). This study investigates the factors controlling the regional and vertical distributions of SOC in soils of volcanic origin. To this aim, we investigated the vertical distribution of SOC in a total of 212 soil profiles representing all combinations of soil-forming factors in a volcanic area with a high diversity of ecosystems and soil types. We analysed the SOC contents in relation to intrinsic (soil type and relevant soil properties: texture and pH) and extrinsic factors (climate, parent material, relief), and we studied the patterns of SOC distribution with depth by fitting the SOC contents to different curve models. Furthermore, we selected ten soil profiles for a more detailed study to assess the effect of vegetation by examining the relationships of the SOC storage and depth distribution to the amount and allocation of plant roots and litterfall. SOC storage was controlled by the interaction of climatic (rainfall), time (substrate age), topographic (slope) and biotic (plant-mediated) factors. Our results indicate that under humid conditions, large organic inputs and the inhibition of microbial degradation due to low pH, AI-toxicity and persistent anaerobiosis within soil microaggregates largely contributed to SOC accumulation. Soil type was a poor predictor of SOC storage, most likely due to the co-occurrence of young and evolved Andosols and a certain andic character in many soils that did not qualify as Andosols. The distributions of root carbon and SOC appeared to be closely interrelated, suggesting a major role of roots in the supply of organic matter and the lack of significant bioturbation. The depth distribution of SOC was best fitted by the quadratic, cubic and power models, the latter being a feasible alternative that should be used to this aim in volcanic soils rather than the widely used exponential model.

The result shows that a large amount of cold air, significant at even a global climatological scale, is exported through this process from high- to low-latitude regions. The theory gives also the average intensity of the wind at the coast. In the coastal regions of Antarctica the wind exhibits a complex behavior. Observations show that katabatic winds in the near-coastal region can be periodic or continuous, or can stay a long time in a quiescent near-critical state, then burst in short and strong gusts. We examine some aspects of these katabatic winds in terms of the mesoscale energy theory developed by Dalu and Green (1983). This complex behavior is described by a nonlinear system, where the relevant parameter is the Froude number of the inflow at a Rossby radius distance from the coast.

In this paper, resilience-oriented modeling details are appropriately presented across four dimensions: modeling objectives and metrics, resilience scenarios, control methods and resilience-oriented strategies. Three types of objective functions are commonly used in existing literature: load maximization, cost minimization and frequency stabilization. To mimic realistic resilience scenarios, uncertainty information, contingencies, distributed generation resources and interdependencies between power systems and other networks (e.g. gas networks) are main factors that need to be considered. Energy management system, optimal power flow and dynamic control are three basic approaches utilized to model resilient power systems. As far as operational strategies in relation to network topologies are concerned, four types are typically met in the literature, these being existing MGs for network resilience, dynamic formation of MGs, islanding schemes of MGs and networked MGs. Different types of MGs and different control methods are also appropriately presented in this part. Finally, research challenges are identified and several future research directions are provided.",0.444

Wind power systems built offshore and on coasts have reduced economic efficiency due to the increase in initial investment costs, because they require a more robust design when installed in areas vulnerable to coastal disasters. The western and southern seas of Korea have a relatively shallow water depth, which is advantageous for the construction of offshore wind farms. However, since it is close to the Pacific Rim, the probability of an earthquake is relatively high compared to those in other regions, and the frequency of typhoons is higher as well, so a more detailed site analysis is necessary. In this study, the GIS technique was used to select an optimal site for wind farms with a focus on reducing the risk of coastal disasters. The current state of earthquakes in the western and southern seas of Korea as well as the movement path and intensity of typhoons affecting or passing through the western and southern seas were also analyzed in a complex manner. As a result, an optimal site for an offshore wind farm with the lowest risk of coastal disasters was analyzed.",0.943

Computations are based on data from three seasonal marine surveys performed in March 1998, June 1998 and January 1999 in the framework of the French Programme National d'Environnement Cotier. A Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone type box model is used to calculate the advective exchanges between the shelf and the adjacent open sea and to estimate the budgets of non-conservative elements (DIP, DIN, DOP, DON, DOC, POC, PON, POP). These budgets consider river discharges, urban sewage supply, atmospheric deposition, and fluxes at the water-sediment and shelf-slope interfaces. Uncertainties on the fluxes and budgets are estimated to assess the robustness of the results with respect to the spatial variability of the system. Results indicate that shelf-slope exchanges by mixing predominate with respect to the major input terms (river discharge and sediment release). Budgets for inorganic nutrients, that show a strong concentration gradient between the shelf and the slope waters, are significantly different from zero and indicate an excess of these elements in the shelf water. For all surveys, these surpluses suggest (i) that the whole shelf system is autotrophic, (1.6-4.3 x 10(3) mol C s(-1)) and acts as a sink of CO2, and (ii) that it is a site of net denitrification (119 mol N s(-1)) and acts as a sink of N-2. Average shelf-slope fluxes of dissolved and particulate organic elements generally indicate an export to the open sea. However, the large uncertainty on these fluxes yields budgets for the shelf not significantly different from zero. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS and Ifremer/CNRS/IRD.

However, they are coming under increasing pressure from climate change, coastal development, and aquaculture. There is increasing need to better understand the changes mangroves face and whether these changes differ or are similar in different parts of the world. Using a multiple case study approach, focused on Vietnam, Zanzibar, and Brazil, this research analyzed the drivers, pressures, states, impacts, and responses (DPSIR) of mangrove systems. A qualitative content analysis was used on a purposively sampled document set for each country to identify and collate evidence under each of the DPSIR categories. Population growth and changing political and economic processes were key drivers across the three countries, leading to land use change and declining states of mangroves. This had an impact on the delivery of regulatory and provisioning ecosystem services from mangroves and on the welfare of coastal communities. Responses have been predominantly regulatory and aim to improve mangrove states, but without always considering ecosystem services or the consequences for welfare. The issue of scale emerged as a critical factor with drivers, pressures, impacts, and responses operating at different levels (from international to local), with consequences for response effectiveness.",0.759

This cycle has profound influence on the fate of inorganic carbon, and, thereby, on the removal of CO2 from the primitive atmosphere. Most calcium deposits were formed in the Precambrian, when the prokaryotic biosphere predominated. After that, calcium recycling based on biogenic deposition by skeletal organisms became the main process. Among prokaryotes, only a few representatives, e.g. cyanobacteria, exhibit a special calcium function. The geochemical calcium cycle is made possible by the universal features of bacteria involved in biologically mediated reactions and is determined by the activities of microbial communities. In the prokaryotic system, the calcium cycle begins with the leaching of igneous rocks, predominantly through the action of the community of organotrophic organisms. The release of carbon dioxide to the soil air by organotrophic aerobes leads to leaching with carbonic acid and soda salinization. Under anoxic conditions, of major importance is the organic acid production by primary anaerobes (fermentative microorganisms). Calcium carbonate is precipitated by secondary anaerobes (sulfate reducers) and to a smaller degree by methanogens. The role of the cyanobacterial community in carbonate deposition is recorded by stromatolites, which are the most common organo-sedimentary Precambrian structures. Deposition of carbonates in cyanobacterial mats as a consequence of photoassimilation of CO2 does not appear to be a significant process. It is argued that carbonates were deposited at the boundary between the ``soda continent{''}, which emerged as a result of subaerial leaching with carbonic acid, and the ocean containing Ca2+. Such ecotones provided favorable conditions for the development of the benthic cyanobacterial communities, which were the precursors of stromatolites.",0.050

To investigate this, multiple high resolution time series measurements of radium across a tidal estuary (Coffs Creek, NSW, Australia) were performed as well as a spatial survey in both bottom and surface layers. Results from the spatial survey revealed increasing radium concentrations in parts of the estuary surrounded by mangroves. The average radium concentration in estuary areas lined with mangroves was 2.5 times higher than the average concentration at the mouth of the estuary and 6.5-fold higher than upstream freshwater areas. Additionally, the area enriched in radium coincided with low dissolved oxygen concentrations, implying that porewater exchange may drive anoxia. A radium mass balance model based on Ra-223 and Ra-224 isotopes at different sections of the estuary confirmed higher porewater exchange rates from areas fringed with mangrove vegetation. Estimated porewater exchange rates were 27.8 +/- 5.3 and 13.6 +/- 2.1 cm d(-1) (0.8 +/- 0.1 and 0.4 +/- 0.1 m(3) s(-1)) based on 223Ra and 224Ra isotopes, respectively. The average saline porewater exchange was similar to 10-fold larger than the upstream surface freshwater inputs to the estuary. We suggest that mangrove environments within subtropical estuaries are hotspots for porewater exchange due to the complex belowground structure of crab burrows and the effect of tidal pumping. Because porewater exchange releases carbon and nitrogen from coastal sediments, development and modification of mangrove areas in subtropical estuaries have a significant effect on coastal biogeochemical cycles.

The cause of the unusual management conflict is the presence of the Mula di Muggia Bank, a nearshore depositional system made up of relict and active migrating sandbanks extending up to 2 km seawards from the touristic beachfront. A reconstruction of the morpho-sedimentary evolution of the coastal system over a 200-year period was done using a large dataset which includes historical cartography, topographic maps, aerial photos and topo-bathymetric surveys. The results show the growth of a significant urban development aimed at creating a tourist destination by occupying the waterfront along fetch-limited coastal tracts with very shallow water and scarce hydrodynamics. Furthermore, a number of sandy dynamic landforms (longshore migrating bars, a bypass corridor, an ebb-tidal delta) and accumulation zones attest to a sediment excess which can be mostly attributed to the eastern river supplies. The progressive constant migration rate of 12.6 my(-1) allowed the bank to induce the expansion of the low-energy silty backbarrier environment, characterised by abundant seagrass meadows a short distance directly in front of the tourist beaches of Grado. As a result of historical analysis and more current observations, areas with diverse morphosedimentary features and with varying tourist/recreational, ecological, and conservation values have been identified. These can be considered as basic units for future accurate planning and re-evaluation of coastal management choices to balance environmental protection and tourist use. A soft coastal defence approach is proposed which includes either the preservation of specific environments or the proper use of excess sand for beach nourishment via periodic dredging or sediment bypassing.",0.931

We present detailed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric analyses on persistent point targets for the historical center of Venice, the tourist area of Sottomarina, and the Zennare farmland close to the southern lagoon edge. The selected areas are characterized by different degrees of development and our analyses show the remarkable capability of SAR Interferometric Point Target Analysis (IPTA) to map land displacement rates in densely urbanized zones and to detect movement information on isolated structures with a mm/year accuracy. A detailed analysis of the time series from 1992 to 2000 provided by IPTA shows that the vertical component of the measured displacements are the superposition of a short timescale, generally seasonal, movement on the order of 1 cm that is likely related to the fluctuation of environmental variables (temperature, piezometric head in the aquifer system underlying the lagoon, sea/lagoon water level) and a long-term ground deformation associated with building construction, the geomorphology of the area, and the human development of natural resources. If Venice is confirmed to be generally stable, significant long-term subsidence on the order of 4 mm/year is detected at the Sottomarina coastland. The highest displacement rates, of up to 8-10 mm/year, are recorded in the farmland bounding the lagoon margin where the movements are found to be highly site-specific.",0.074

Analysis of hydrogeochemical parameters of the groundwater for the Lower Ganga basin is presented to identify the contamination zones and also to understand the groundwater quality in this region. Drainage pattern analysis identifies five sub-basins in the region. Shannon's entropy information theory has been performed to compute the water quality index (WQI) without having any subjective bias in the analysis. The analysis of the WQI shows that sub-basin 2 (WQI = 38.35) has excellent quality of groundwater, whereas sub-basin 1 (WQI = 52.43), 3 (WQI = 63.94), and 5 (WQI = 82.79) are having good groundwater quality. On the other hand, sub-basin 4 (WQI = 102.99), which covers mostly the central part of the main stream, is found to be most contaminated and having a medium quality of the groundwater. Analysis of the groundwater parameters using the PCA indicates that the quality of groundwater in the study area is controlled mainly by three main factors, which are geogenic process (weathering and leaching of rocks), seawater intrusion (natural process), and anthropogenic activities. Furthermore, hydrometeorological analysis shows a gradual drop in precipitation, water level depth, and the percolation index (PI). This indicates an over exploitation of groundwater resources in the study region under the present circumstances of climate variability, population and industrialization. The results obtained in this paper are useful for identifying suitable sites for tube-wells and bore-wells for drinking and agricultural purposes, and also for developing an effective strategy to avoid further contamination of groundwater aquifers in the region.

Previous studies have shown that POC/Th-234 ratios may vary by as much as two orders of magnitude, but the mechanism for this variability remains poorly understood. In this study, POC/Th-234 and POC/Th-228 ratios in three particle size classes were examined for samples collected from the upper 500 m at a station in the South China Sea. Our results indicate that changes in the POC/Th-234 ratio with particle size at a given depth are mostly driven by simple decay of Th-234. In fact, various trends in the POC/Th-234 ratio versus particle size are explained by a combination of Th-234 decay and the preferential remineralization of POC relative to Th during particle aggregation. We also observed a trend of decreasing Th-234/Th-228 ratios with particle size. This trend is consistent with results expected from a Brownian-pumping model.",0.044

The Kennedy Space Center and Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in east central Florida offer a representative site for investigating how changes to vegetation distribution interact with management to impact coastal protection. Here, salt marshes are converting to mangroves, and mosquito impoundment structures are being modified. The resulting changes to vegetation composition and topography influence coastal protection services in wetlands. We used a model-based assessment of wave attenuation and erosion to compare vegetation (mangrove, salt marsh) and impoundment state (intact, graded). Our findings suggest that the habitat needed to attenuate 90\% of wave height is significantly larger for salt marshes than mangroves. Erosion prevention was significantly higher (470\%) in scenarios with mangroves than in salt marshes. Intact berms attenuated waves over shorter distances, but did not significantly reduce erosion. Differences in coastal protection were driven more by vegetation than by impoundment state. Overall, our findings reveal that mangroves provide more coastal protection services, and therefore more coastal protection value, than salt marshes in east central Florida.

We also measured nitrate uptake and Th-234 export throughout the northern western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region on a cruise in January 2013. We used a nonsteady state Th-234 equation with temporally varying upwelling rates and an irradiance-based phytoplankton production model to correct our export and new production estimates in the complex coastal site near Palmer Station. Results unequivocally showed that nitrate uptake and net community production were significantly greater than the sinking particle export on region-wide spatial scales and season-long temporal scales. At our coastal site, new production (10517.4mgNm(-2)d(-1), meanstandard error) was 5.3 times greater than vertical nitrogen export (20.42.4mgNm(-2)d(-1)). On the January cruise in the northern WAP, new production (47.914.4mgNm(-2)d(-1)) was 2.4 times greater than export (19.9 +/- 1.4mgNm(-2)d(-1)). Much of this imbalance can be attributed to diffusive losses of particulate nitrogen from the surface ocean due to diapycnal mixing, indicative of a leaky WAP ecosystem.

Although future sea-level rise is predicted to change the characteristics of these habitats, its impact on their rate of C-org sequestration is highly uncertain. Here we used historical depositional records to show that relative sea-level (RSL) changes regulated C-org accumulation rates in boreal contiguous seagrass-saltmarsh habitats. Age-depth modeling and geological and biogeochemical approaches indicated that C-org accumulation rates varied as a function of changes in depositional environments and habitat relocations. In particular, C-org accumulation rates were enhanced in subtidal seagrass meadows during times of RSL rise, which were caused by postseismic land subsidence and climate change. Our findings identify historical analogs for the future impact of RSL rise driven by global climate change on rates of C-org sequestration in coastal habitats.",0.325

Therefore, under such perspective, sustainability could be viewed as a ``reflexive teaming process{''}. This is exactly what this paper intends to deliver, especially to the scientific community striving to alleviate the freshwater scarcity crisis. However, in order to fully embrace the concept of sustainable water management, one should look beyond the limits of technology. This work, therefore, freely overshoots the scope of desalination technology as such. The direct per capita availability of freshwater resources decreases as the world population continues its growth. This fact threatens not only future economic growth expectations but also more importantly the well being and subsequently the survival of humanity as a whole. In the present debate, the Canary Island of Lanzarote (Spain) and the City of Laayoune (Moroccan Sahara) are taken as case studies. The North-South approach is used to raise certain questions on the significance of scarcity. Indeed, the issue of ``water for tourists{''} might seem far removed from water scarcities for poor people in the South. If we assume a technological trajectory or decreased monetary costs, decreased energy costs per cubic metre, and moreover increased share of renewable energies in desalination (a kind of win-win-win scenario), does this mean that water for urban use of poor people in the world will cease to be a problem? Will not the energy costs remain too high, anyway? Here, an approach from the ``basic needs{''} scenario (free lifeline, in South Africa) is relevant.",0.139

Nagender","Distribution of metals in different binding phases of estuarine sediments provides chemically significant description of metal-sediment interactions. This study describes the influences of ligand field stabilization energy (LFSE), Jahn-Teller effect, and water exchange rate (k (-w)) on metal distribution in different binding phases of estuarine sediments. It was found that Cu had highest affinity for organic binding phases in the studied sediments followed by Ni and Pb. However, Pb showed strong association with Fe/Mn oxide phases followed by Ni and Cu. Faster k (-w) of Cu (II) (1 x 10(9) s(-1)) increased the rate of complex formation of Cu2+ ion with ligand in the organic phases. The Cu-ligand (from organic phase) complexes gained extra stability by the Jahn-Teller effect. The combined effects of these two phenomena and high ionic potential increased the association of Cu with the organic phases of the sediments than Ni and Pb. The smaller ionic radii of Ni2+ (0.72 ) than Pb2+ (1.20 ) increase the stability of Ni-ligand complexes in the organic phase of the sediments. High LFSE of Ni(II) (compared with Pb2+ ions) also make Ni-organic complexes increasingly stable than Pb. High k (-w) (7 Au 10(9) s(-1)) of Pb did not help it to associate with organic phases in the sediments. The high concentration of Pb in the Fe/Mn oxyhydroxide binding phase was probably due to co-precipitation of Pb2+ and Fe3+. High surface area or site availability for Pb2+ ion on Fe oxyhydroxide phase was probably responsible for the high concentration of Pb in Fe/Mn oxyhydroxide phase. Increasing concentrations of Cu in organic phases with the increasing Cu loading suggest that enough binding sites were available for Cu in the organic binding phases of the sediments.

However, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive analysis and summary of these methods aimed at improving investment efficiency. To this end, this paper undertakes a systematic literature review of methodologies and theories commonly used in offshore wind power investment decision-making, following with the characteristics, applicability of various methods discussed and discussion of representative literature. Then, the selected papers were classified by the year of publication (2010e2020), journals, country of author affiliation, method consideration perspectives and application fields. These classifications are presented to highlight the trends, which aim to provide broad, systematic approaches and tools for assessment of power investment, and to give suggestions on which method to use for each situation. It can be seen that the popularity and applicability of these methods have improved after 2015. They cannot replace but complement each other and should be implemented in a parallel or better comprehensive way. The outputs of this review will map appropriate analytical techniques to specific investment applications and perspectives, provide researchers with guidance on future investment decision-making research, and point out any possible gaps. Specifically, through this review, decision-makers would be able to choose the best-suited or hybrid methodology, according to different fields and objects, for investment viability and effectiveness.

Our results show high Benthic-Planktic C-14 age differences of similar to 1500 C-14 years 33-26.5 ka suggesting significant water column stratification between similar to 100-2600 m water depth, and reduction and/or shoaling of deep-water formation. This phase was followed by breakup of the stratification during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 26-20 ka), with Benthic-Planktic C-14 age differences of similar to 250 C-14 years, likely due to enhanced upwelling.

A low-dimensional reduced-order method is developed for uncertainty quantification and capturing the statistical sensitivity in the principal model directions with largest variability and in various regimes in two-layer quasigeostrophic turbulence. Typical dynamical regimes tested here include the homogeneous flow in the high latitudes and the anisotropic meandering jets in the low latitudes and/or mid latitudes. The idea in the reduced-order method is from a self-consistent mathematical framework for general systems with quadratic nonlinearity, where crucial high-order statistics are approximated by a systematic model calibration procedure. Model efficiency is improved through additional damping and noise corrections to replace the expensive energy-conserving nonlinear interactions. Model errors due to the imperfect nonlinear approximation are corrected by tuning the model parameters using linear response theory with an information metric in a training phase before prediction. Here a statistical energy principle is adopted to introduce a global scaling factor in characterizing the higher-order moments in a consistent way to improve model sensitivity. The reduced-order model displays uniformly high prediction skill for the mean and variance response to general forcing for both homogeneous flow and anisotropic zonal jets in the first 102 dominant low-wavenumber modes, where only about 0.15\% of the total spectral modes are resolved, compared with the full model resolution of 256(2) horizontal modes.",0.050

Samples were analyzed for sediment texture, total organic carbon, CaCO3, metals (Al, Fe, Hg, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn), aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (AH and PAH). Sediments were generally sandy (excepting muddy samples from APAMLC), with variable amounts of TOC, OM and CaCO3. Most of the sediments exhibited low to moderate concentrations of metals, except APAMLC. Low contamination of sediments by hydrocarbons was found but samples from XLSP and APAMLC exhibited the highest concentrations of biogenic AH and PAH from pyrogenic sources. In APAMLC and PEMLS, the levels of metals can be considered as background levels according to geochemical indices (Igeo and EF).

G.","Today, coal and oil are the main energy sources used in the world. However, these sources will last for only a few decades. Hence, the investigation of possible energy sources to meet this crisis has become a crucial task. Coal bed methane (CBM) is a potential energy source which can be used to fulfil the energy demand. Since the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted to the atmosphere from the use of CBM is comparatively very low compared to conventional energy sources, it is also a potential mitigation option for global warming. This paper reviews CBM recovery techniques with particular emphasis on CO2-enhanced coal bed methane (CO2-ECBM) recovery. The paper reviews (1) conventional CBM recovery techniques and problems associated with them, (2) CBM production-enhancement methods, including hydro-fracturing and enhanced CBM recovery techniques, such as N-2-ECBM and CO2-ECBM, (3) the importance of the CO2-ECBM technique compared to other methods and problems with it, (4) the effect of CO2 injection during the CO2-ECBM process on coal seam permeability and strength and (5) current CO2-ECBM field projects and their progress. Although conventional CBM recovery methods are simple (basically related to the drawdown of the reservoir pressure to release methane from it), they are inefficient for the recovery of a commercially viable amount of methane from coal seams. Therefore, to enhance methane production, several methods are used, such as hydro-fracturing and ECBM (N-2-ECBM and CO2-ECBM). The CO2-ECBM process has a number of advantages compared to other methane recovery techniques, as it contributes to the mitigation of the atmospheric CO2 level, is safer and more economical. However, as a result of CO2 injection into the coal seam during the CO2-ECBM process, coal mass permeability and strength may be crucially changed, due to the coal matrix swelling associated with CO2 adsorption into the coal matrix. Both injecting CO2 properties (gas type, CO2 phase and pressure) and coal seam properties (coal rank and temperature) affect this swelling. Although there are many related studies, a number of gaps exist, especially in the area of coal rank and how the effect of other factors varies with the rank of the coal seam. To date, there have been few CO2-ECBM field projects in the world. However, the reduction of CO2 injectability after some time of CO2 injection, due to coal matrix swelling near the well bore, is a common problem in the field. Therefore, various permeability-enhancing techniques, such as hydro-fracturing and injection of an inert gas such as N-2 or a mixture of inert gases (N-2 + CO2) into the seam to recover the swelled areas are under test in the field.",0.129

Accurate information on future dynamic risk of coastal flooding and its physical and socioeconomic drivers is essential for planning effective and targeted adaptation. However, the current scenarios regarding urban development are insufficient to predict the future dynamic spatial distribution of urban socioeconomic and physical growth, hindering the exact and dynamic assessment of future coastal flood risk. Moreover, the relative contributions of SLR and urban development to the future dynamics of city-level coastal flood risk have not been examined. Therefore, here we developed a land use-based urban growth scenario for the temporally and spatially explicit simulation of future urban growth in terms of buildings, roads and electrical facilities, and combined it with a local temporally explicit SLR scenario, into a ``hazard-exposure-vulnerability{''} model, for the purpose of dynamic risk assessment of coastal flooding on the urban built environment in Xiamen, China by 2050, and accordingly examined the relative contributions of SLR and urban growth. Our results demonstrated a good performance of the land use-based urban growth model. SLR and urban growth will increase future coastal flood risk (represented by the expected annual damage, EAD) in varying degrees, but their combination is projected to exacerbate future flood damages significantly, indicating that considering either SLR or urban growth in isolation will underestimate future coastal flood risk. Moreover, the relative contributions of SLR and urban growth are dynamic over time, depending on the rate of SLR and the stage of urbanization: for example, the change in coastal flood risk is mainly attributable to urban growth in the phase of rapid urbanization before 2033 in Xiamen, yet the contribution of urban growth then becomes less important compared to SLR, when urbanization slows down, while SLR reaches a threshold after accelerating growth. The approach and results of our study can be considered a decision support tool, to help decision makers assess future coastal flood risk and detect the relative importance of each driving force, in order to employ land use planning, nature-based solutions and engineering protection, to achieve sustainable and resilient coastal cities.",0.271

Manganese depth profiles from 10 sediment cores, documented using centimetre-scale X-ray fluorescence core scanning, display highly-enriched 1 to 10 cm thick layers. These manganese-rich layers are more numerous, but of lower concentration, in close proximity to the field, and show no consistent relationship with sedimentology (clay vs. carbonate content) or the established chronostratigraphic framework at the site. X-ray diffraction and sequential dissolution procedures indicate that the manganese enrichments are authigenic carbonates, which formed along a palaeo redox boundary during periods of prolonged steady-state conditions. The hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity of this manganese record is linked to the nearby gas hydrate and cold seep field, by influencing redox conditions and/or sedimentation processes, is investigated here. Results are consistent with more frequent interruption of steady-state sedimentation in closer proximity to the salt-tectonic induced bathymetric mound, which contains the active cold seeps and gas hydrate deposits. Thus, spatial mapping of manganese enrichment horizons provides a tool to reconstruct sedimentation surrounding these volatile sea bed features, yielding a measure of past activity of gas hydrates and cold seeps.",0.051

For each risk, we investigated a range of adaptation approaches that can be considered and selected by conservation practitioners in designing conservation interventions. Key results. For each risk identified, a range of adaptation measures can be selected: do nothing; maintain and enhance habitat, intensive species management, and preserve populations (including through ex situ conservation); or exploit the natural characteristics of islands to conserve biodiversity.

Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to these changes. System responses to stressors are important for resource managers and environmental stewards to understand in order to best manage them. Thin layer sand or sediment application to drowning and eroding marshes is one approach to build elevation and resilience. The above-and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments were examined at varying inundation regimes between mean sea level and mean high water (0.82 m NAVD88 to 1.49 m NAVD88) in a field experiment at Laws Point, part of the Plum Island Sound Estuary (MA). Significantly lower salinities, pH, sulfides, phosphates, and ammonium were measured in the sand-amended sediments than in the natural sediments. In natural sediments there was a pattern of increasing salinity with increasing elevation while in the sand-amended sediments the trend was reversed, showing decreasing salinity with increasing elevation. Sulfide concentrations generally increased from low to high inundation with highest concentrations at the highest inundation (i. e., at the lowest elevations). High pore water phosphate concentrations were measured at low elevations in the natural sediments, but the sand-amended treatments had mostly low concentrations of phosphate and no consistent pattern with elevation. At the end of the experiment the lowest elevations generally had the highest measures of pore water ammonium. Soil carbon dioxide emissions were greatest in the sandamended mesocosms and at higher elevations. Differences in coarse root and rhizome abundances and volumes among the sediment treatments were detected with CT imaging, but by 20 weeks the natural and sand-amended treatments showed similar total belowground biomass at the intermediate and high elevations. Although differences in pore water nutrient concentrations, pH, salinity, and belowground root and rhizome morphology were detected between the natural and sand-amended sediments, similar belowground productivity and total biomass were measured by the end of the growing season. Since the belowground productivity supports organic matter accumulation and peat buildup in marshes, our results suggest that thin layer sand or sediment application is a viable climate adaptation action to build elevation and coastal resiliency, especially in areas with low natural sediment supplies.",0.792

Reaz Akter; Tanim, A. H.; Islam, S. M. Samiul","Bangladesh coast is recognized as one of the hotspots of several coastal hazards like coastal flood, sea level rise, increased tropical cyclone occurrence etc. To understand the problem followed by necessary coastal management recommendation, an integrated coastal vulnerability index i.e., Composite Vulnerability Index (CVI) was developed for the coastal region applying geospatial technique. Three sub-indices, namely, Coastal Characteristics Vulnerability sub-index (CCVI), Coastal Forcing Vulnerability Sub-index (CFVI) and Socio-economic vulnerability sub-index (SEW) were separately estimated and combined to determine the CVI. Since, the classical set theory of traditional vulnerability classification is inadequate to express the natural variability of vulnerability at continuous scale, this study offered a framework of vulnerability representation using fuzzy set theory. The approach was effective to handle the uncertainty of large scale vulnerability analysis with the normalization of featured factors applying three fuzzy membership functions i.e., Fuzzy-Large, Fuzzy-Small and Fuzzy-Linear in geospatial analysis. The analysis was carried out at 10 m cell level and classified with five vulnerability classes i.e., very high, high, moderate, low and very low. The analyses show that the Chittagong coast and Feni district are very highly vulnerable. High tide amplitude (> 4 m), cyclone track density and mild coastal slope are responsible for the high vulnerability of the Chittagong coast. On the other hand, Feni district shows the highest SEVI which is resulted from high population density and socio-economic conditions. Presence of mangrove forest results a reduced CFVI which significantly decrease the vulnerability of Pirojpur, Satkhira, Khulna and Bagerhat district. Based on the responsible vulnerability index, necessary coastal protection measures are recommended for the coast. It is expected that the comprehensive vulnerability map with CVI can be a key element for coastal management of Bangladesh. Furthermore, the classification of vulnerability under different class will help to develop necessary coastal protection measures according to the resiliency of the coastal community.",0.665

Ejecta features include devitrified vesicular impact glass, spherules, accretionary lapilli, microtektites and tektites, and shocked quartz grains containing relict planar features including planar deformation features (PDFs) and planar fractures. The original volume of ejecta has been significantly reduced by carbonate replacement and recrystallization, so that today it only makes up similar to 20\% of the debrisite volume. Volumetrically, the primary component of the debrisite is ripped-up clasts of the local bedrock, including carbonate grainstones, stromatolites, and chert of the 1878 Ma Gunflint Formation. These boulder-to coarses-and-sized clasts commonly fine upward, in marked contrast to the chaotic nature of the remainder of the debrisite. Seven of the eight sites have had the upper portion of the impact layer removed by glaciation. The eighth site shows a complete stratigraphic section from the Gunflint Formation, through the ejecta bearing layer, and into the overlying 1832 Ma Rove Formation. Zircons extracted from one of the ejecta sites, and probably derived from Gunflint tuffaceous material entrained by the turbulent flow, reveal U-Pb ages clustered around 1856 Ma. The sequence of events deduced from these outcrops begins with mafic volcanic ash being deposited and reworked in a carbonate-dominated, nearshore environment that supported microbial mat growth and stromatolites. During subsequent subaerial exposure, blocky, meteoric calcite cements formed in this material. Upon impact, earthquakes fractured this bedrock as well as underlying Gunflint Formation cherts and carbonates. Impact-generated base surges, or less likely, tsunamis, stripped the area of loose sediment and ground up the Gunflint carbonates into fine-sand-to fine-gravel-sized clasts. This debris was mixed with the ejecta, along with ripped-up, fractured Gunflint chert-carbonate clasts, before being deposited as a chaotic, laterally variable layer.

With significant global coral reef cover already lost due to bleaching-induced mortality, efforts are underway to identify thermally tolerant coral communities that might survive projected warming. Massive, long-lived corals accrete skeletal bands of anomalously high density in response to episodes of thermal stress. These ``stress bands{''} are potentially valuable proxies for thermal tolerance, but to date their application to questions of community bleaching history has been limited. Ecological surveys recorded bleaching of coral communities across the Palau archipelago during the 1998 and 2010 warm events. Between 2011 and 2015, we extracted skeletal cores from living Porites colonies at 10 sites spanning barrier reef and lagoon environments and quantified the proportion of stress bands present in each population during bleaching years. Across Palau, the prevalence of stress bands tracked the severity of thermal stress, with more stress bands occurring in 1998 (degree heating weeks = 13.57 A degrees C-week) than during the less severe 2010 event (degree heating weeks = 4.86 A degrees C-week). Stress band prevalence also varied by reef type, as more corals on the exposed barrier reef formed stress bands than did corals from sheltered lagoon environments. Comparison of Porites stress band prevalence with bleaching survey data revealed a strong correlation between percent community bleaching and the proportion of colonies with stress bands in each year. Conversely, annual calcification rates did not decline consistently during bleaching years nor did annually resolved calcification histories always track interannual variability in temperature. Our data suggest that stress bands in massive corals contain valuable information about spatial and temporal trends in coral reef bleaching and can aid in conservation efforts to identify temperature-tolerant coral reef communities.",0.082

This creates considerable uncertainties when benthic processes are considered in global biogeochemical or Earth system circulation models to simulate climate-ocean interactions and biogeochemical tracer distributions in the ocean. In an attempt to improve our understanding of the rate and depth distribution of organic carbon mineralization in bioturbated (0-20 cm) sediments at the global scale, we parameterized a 1-D diagenetic model that simulates the mineralization of three discrete POC pools (a ``multi-G{''} model). The rate constants of the three reactive classes (highly reactive, reactive, refractory) are fixed and determined to be 70, 0.5 and similar to 0.001 yr(-1), respectively, based on the Martin curve model for pelagic POC degradation. In contrast to previous approaches, however, the reactivity of the organic material degraded in the seafloor is continuous with, and set by, the apparent reactivity of material sinking through the water column. Despite the simplifications of describing POC remineralization using G-type approaches, the model is able to simulate a global database (185 stations) of benthic oxygen and nitrate fluxes across the sediment-water interface in addition to porewater oxygen and nitrate distributions and organic carbon burial efficiencies. It is further consistent with degradation experiments using fresh phytoplankton reported in a previous study. We propose that an important yet mostly overlooked consideration in upscaling approaches is the proportion of the reactive POC classes reaching the seafloor in addition to their reactivity. The approach presented is applicable to both steady-state and non-steady state scenarios, and links POC degradation kinetics in sedimentary environments to water depth and the POC rain rate to the seafloor.",0.104

The study revealed that the OM in the sediments is immature but is present in sufficient abundance {[}>1\% total organic carbon (TOC)] and with a good enough quality {[}hydrogen index (HI) around 185 mg hydrocarbon/g TOC on average] to constitute a potential source rock. A deeper insight into the composition of the OM was provided by the extraction and analysis of the kerogen from 15 samples. These samples were submitted to visual inspection and the counting of organic particles under the microscope (palynofacies analysis), elemental analysis and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Although individually the various observations did not provide evidence clearly diagnostic of the origin of the OM, they confirm that it has a mixed marine-terrestrial origin, a notable part of the terrestrial contribution very probably originating from leaves. The good buoyancy of the OM and its richness in lipid components might explain the spreading of terrestrial OM over a large area and its relatively good oil potential. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

E.; Ducklow, Hugh W.","U-238-Th-234 disequilibrium is a powerful tool for investigating particle cycling and carbon export associated with the ocean's biological carbon pump. However, the interpretation of this method is complicated by multiple processes that can modify carbon:thorium ratios over small spatial scales. We investigated seasonal variability in the thorium and carbon cycles at a coastal site in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Throughout the ice-free summer season, we quantified carbon and Th-234 vertical flux, total water column Th-234, particulate Th-234, and the C:Th-234 ratios of sinking material and bulk suspended material. Simultaneous identification and separation of fecal pellets from sinking material showed that fecal pellets (primarily from krill) contributed 56\% of carbon flux and that as a result of lower C:Th-234 ratios than suspended particles, these fecal pellets were primary drivers of variability in the C:Th-234 ratios of sinking material. Bulk suspended particles had highly variable C:Th-234 ratios and were consistently elevated in the euphotic zone relative to deeper waters. The fraction of Th-234 adsorbed onto particles was positively correlated with chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations. The C:Th-234 ratios of suspended particles were positively correlated with POC, although during the spring diatom bloom C:Th-234 ratios were lower than would have been predicted based on POC concentrations alone. We hypothesize that diatom production of transparent exopolymers may have led to enhanced rates of thorium adsorption during the bloom, thus decreasing the C:Th-234 ratios. We used a Bayesian model selection approach to develop and parameterize mechanistic models to simulate thorium sorption dynamics. The best model incorporated one slowly-sinking POC pool and rapidly-sinking fecal pellets, with second-order sorption kinetics. The model accurately simulated temporal patterns in the C:Th-234 ratios of sinking and suspended particles and the fraction of Th-234 adsorbed to particles. However, it slightly over-estimated C:Th-234 ratios during the spring (diatom-dominated) bloom and underestimated C:Th-234 ratios during the fall (mixed-assemblage) bloom. Optimized model parameters for thorium sorption and desorption were 0.0047 +/-\& nbsp;0.0002 m3 mmol C-1 d(-1) and 0.017 +/- 0.008 d(-1), respectively. Our results highlight the important role that specific taxa can play in modifying the C:Th-234 ratio of sinking and suspended particles and provide guidance for future studies that use Th-234 measurements to investigate the functional relationships driving the efficiency of the biological pump.",0.028

The complexity of climate change's likely impacts, such as increased flooding, has widened the scope of information necessary to take action. This is particularly the case in valuable low-lying coastal regions, which host many competing interests, and where there is a growing need to draw from varied fields in the risk-based management of flooding. The rising scrutiny over science's ability to match expectations of policy actors has called for the integration of stakeholder and scientific knowledge domains. Focusing on the Broads - the United Kingdom's largest protected wetland - this study looked to assess future flood risk and consider potential adaptation responses in a collaborative approach. Interviews and surveys with local stakeholders accompanied the development of a hydraulic model in an iterative participatory design, centred on a scientist-stakeholder workshop. Knowledge and perspectives were shared on processes driving risk in the Broads, as well as on the implications of adaptation measures, allowing for their prioritisation.

This paper focuses on the energy and environmental performance of hot-water production systems utilized by high class hotels in Cyprus in order to formulate appropriate carbon emission mitigation strategies. The main systems used are boilers fired by Liquefied Petroleum Gas or Diesel oil, air-source heat pumps and flat plate solar collectors. The results show that the combination of air-source heat pumps with flat plate solar collectors leads to the lowest primary energy consumption. Therefore, improving the sustainability of the tourism sector in Cyprus requires to phase out the usage of boiler systems that are currently in use in almost all four star and five star hotels and promote the use of solar thermal systems in combination with air-source heat pumps. These findings are relevant for island states and other popular tourist destinations sharing similar characteristics with those of Cyprus and provide a framework for national authorities to plan an appropriate energy and environmental upgrade of the hotel stock.

Traditional disinfectant chlorine (Cl-2) has been replaced with stable and safe disinfection processes. Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) as an alternative disinfectant has been increasingly adopted in various water treatment facilities. To identify the applicability of ClO2 to RO desalination process, lab-scale experiments were designed by simulating actual oxidant exposure circumstances. In the experiment, Cl-2 or ClO2 solution was injected separately into a working RO system. Our results showed that Cl-2 dosage greatly decreased permeate flux slope. However, instant flux increase of approximately 5\% was observed when ClO2 was injected. ATR FT-IR and EDX analysis for exposed membranes showed that Cl-2 deformed amide peaks and attached Cl atom onto the membrane, indicating chlorination. However, none of these results was observed in ClO2 exposure cases. In addition, immediate sodium bisulfite application alleviated flux decrease under Cl-2 chlorination.

The dynamics of DOM leaching from different marsh plants, however, have not been well studied or compared. Methods In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the processes of DOM leaching from three common marsh plants (Phragrnites australis, Suaeda salsa and Aeluropus littoralis) collected from the Yellow River Delta (YRD) salt marsh in October 2016. The YRD is one of the largest and most well-protected coastal ecosystems on the east coast of China. Important Findings We found that the plant leaves released DOM at much higher concentrations than the plant roots or stems, as measured by the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved nitrogen (DN). On average, 15\% of the biomass C and 30\% of the biomass N were released from the plant leaves as DOC and DN during the 27-day incubation period. The DOM released from the plants was very labile, and 92A\%-98.1\% of the DOC arid 88.0\%-94.6\% of the DN released from the plants were consumed by bacteria during the 27-day incubation period. The fluorescence characteristics of the plant-released DOM indicated that chromophoric dissolved organic matter was a major fraction of the DOM and that protein-like components were the primary organic fractions released from the plants. Bacterial degradation altered both the fluorescence properties and the chemical composition of the DOM. The results of the laboratory experiments were well supported by the field investigation, which indicated that a large amount of DOM was outwelled from the YRD salt marshes in late autumn. Our study suggests that the DOM released from the biomass of salt marsh plants provides an important source of both DOC and DN for marsh and coastal waters. The highly labile DOC and DN provide essential food sources to support microbial communities in the YRD salt marsh and adjacent coastal waters.",0.480

We examined spatial and temporal patterns in dehydrogenase, arylsulfatase, alkaline and acid phosphatase activities, and their relationships with organic carbon and microbial biomass nitrogen at three sites in Israel representing different climatic regions: Mediterranean (humid), mildly and and arid. The sites were selected along a climatic transect from the Judean Mountains in the west to the Dead Sea in the east of Israel. With increasing aridity, soil organic carbon, soil microbial biomass nitrogen, dehydrogenase, phosphatase and different pools of arylsulfatase activities decreased significantly. A sharp change in enzyme activities existed between 260- and 120-mm mean annual rainfall, The arylsulfatase activity of the microbial biomass in the 0-2- and 5-10-cm soil layers usually accounted for more than 50\% of the total activity, and the fraction of total activity in the 0-2-cm soil layer of the and sites was significantly greater than that of the humid site. Dehydrogenase and total and microbial biomass arylsulfatase activities were sensitive indicators of the climatic change along the transect. At the humid and mildly and sites, the activities of dehydrogenase were less in the winter than in the summer and spring, whereas total and microbial biomass arylsulfatase activities were less in both summer and winter. At the and site, lower values were observed in the summer at 0-2-cm soil depth. At all sites, lower alkaline phosphatase activities at 0-2 cm were observed in the summer, but there were no significant seasonal differences in acid phosphatase activities. These different seasonal patterns of enzyme activities are attributed to the enzyme source, and specific seasonal soil moisture and temperature conditions at the studied sites. The low dehydrogenase and microbial biomass arylsulfatase activities in the winter at the humid and mildly and sites are explained by the cold and wet soil conditions, and the low enzyme activity in the summer at the and site is attributed to the dry and hot soil conditions.

However, the ecological effects of such structures on the natural surroundings remain unclear. We investigated the impact of experimentally introduced tetrapod fields on the demersal fish community in a hard-bottom area in the southern North Sea. The results indicated a significant decrease in fish abundance in the surrounding area caused by migration effects towards the artificial structures. Diversity (HB) and evenness (E) values exhibited greater variation after the introduction of the tetrapods. Additionally, a distinct increase in young-of-the-year (YOY) fish was observed near the structures within the second year after introduction. We suggest that the availability of adequate refuges in combination with additional food resources provided by the artificial structures has a highly species-specific attraction effect. However, these findings also demonstrate that our knowledge regarding the impact of artificial structures on temperate fish communities is still too limited to truly understand the ecological processes that are initiated by the introduction of artificial structures. Long-term investigations and additional experimental in situ work worldwide will be indispensable for a full understanding of the mechanisms by which coastal defence structures interact with the coastal environment.

Larimichthys crocea (large yellow croaker) is a long-lived fish, which performs seasonal migrations from its spawning and nursery grounds along the coast of the East China Sea (ECS) to overwintering grounds offshore. This study used length-based analysis and habitat suitability index (HSI) model to evaluate the current life-history parameters and overwintering habitat suitability of L. crocea, respectively. We compared recent (2019) and historical (1971-1982) life-history parameters and overwintering HSI to analyze the fishing pressure and climate change effects on the overall population and overwintering phase of L. crocea. The length-based analysis indicated serious overfishing of L. crocea, characterized by reduced catch, size truncation, constrained distribution, and advanced maturation causing a recruitment bottleneck. The overwintering HSI modeling results indicated that climate change has led to decreased sea surface temperature during L. crocea overwintering phase over the last half-century, which in turn led to area decrease and an offshore-oriented shifting of optimal overwintering habitat of L. crocea. The fishing-caused size truncation may have constrained the migratory ability, and distribution of L. crocea subsequently led to the mismatch of the optimal overwintering habitat against climate change background, namely habitat bottleneck. Hence, while heavy fishing was the major cause of L. crocea collapse, climate-induced overwintering habitat suitability may have intensified the fishery collapse of L. crocea population. It is important for management to consider both overfishing and climate change issues when developing stock enhancement activities and policy regulations, particularly for migratory long-lived fish that share a similar life history to L. crocea. Combined with China's current restocking and stock enhancement initiatives, we propose recommendations for the future restocking of L. crocea in China.",0.184

Existing spatial projections of urban extent are, however, often available at coarse spatial resolutions, local geographical scales or for short time horizons, which limits their suitability for broad-scale coastal flood impact assessments. Here, we present a new set of spatially explicit projections of urban extent for ten countries in the Mediterranean, consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). To model plausible future urban development, we develop an Urban Change Model, which uses input variables such as elevation, population density or road network and an artificial neural network to project urban development on a regional scale. The developed future projections for the five SSPs indicate that accounting for the spatial patterns of urban development can lead to significant differences in the assessment of future coastal urban exposure. The increase in exposure in the Extended Low Elevation Coastal Zone (E-LECZ = area below 20 m of elevation) until 2100 can vary, by up to 104\%, depending on the urban development scenario chosen. This finding highlights that accounting for urban development in long-term adaptation planning, e.g. in the form of land-use planning, can be an effective measure for reducing future coastal flood risk on a regional scale.",0.758

The objective of this research was to study the rate of urea hydrolysis in soil profile toposequences sampled from the Coastal Plain (CP) and Piedmont (PM) regions of Maryland to understand native urea hydrolysis rates (UHRs) as well as the controls governing urea hydrolysis both across a landscape and with depth in the soil profile. A pH-adjustment experiment was conducted to explore the relationship between pH and urea hydrolysis because of the importance of pH to both agronomic productivity and microbial communities. Soils were sampled from both A and B horizons along transects containing an agricultural field (AG), a grassed field border (GB), and a perennially vegetated zone adjacent to surface water. On average, the A-horizon UHRs were eight times greater than corresponding B-horizon rates, and within the CP, the riparian zone (RZ) soils hydrolyzed urea faster than the agricultural soils. The pH adjustment of these soils indicated the importance of organic-matter-related factors (C, N, extractable metals) in determining UHR. These results suggest that organic-matter-rich RZ soils may be valuable in mitigating losses of urea from neighboring fields.

Within the East Atlantic Flyway, along the coast of West-Africa, the intertidal mudflats of Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania, host over 2 million migratory waterbirds. Despite the protected status of the Banc d'Arguin, geographical remoteness and seemingly benign human exploitation, we show that large changes have taken place in the intertidal benthic macrofauna across an interval of 28 years. We compared the results of two comparable and spatially comprehensive large-scale benthic surveys in 1986 and 2014. Over this time, the benthos changed from a diverse community to one dominated by a few species of bivalve, with a loss of polychaete worms. The change was associated with a twofold increase in the seagrass cover. Our results suggest that the intertidal habitats of Banc d'Arguin have altered markedly over the last three decades and the estimated benthic secondary production has decreased by a factor of four. These shifts in community structure and production may have contributed to declines in some benthivorous migratory shorebirds. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Emil","Background Lagoons are common along coastlines worldwide and are important for biogeochemical element cycling, coastal biodiversity, coastal erosion protection and blue carbon sequestration. These ecosystems are frequently disturbed by weather, tides, and human activities. Here, we investigated a shallow lagoon in New England. The brackish ecosystem releases hydrogen sulfide particularly upon physical disturbance, causing blooms of anoxygenic sulfur-oxidizing phototrophs. To study the habitat, microbial community structure, assembly and function we carried out in situ experiments investigating the bloom dynamics over time. Results Phototrophic microbial mats and permanently or seasonally stratified water columns commonly contain multiple phototrophic lineages that coexist based on their light, oxygen and nutrient preferences. We describe similar coexistence patterns and ecological niches in estuarine planktonic blooms of phototrophs. The water column showed steep gradients of oxygen, pH, sulfate, sulfide, and salinity. The upper part of the bloom was dominated by aerobic phototrophic Cyanobacteria, the middle and lower parts by anoxygenic purple sulfur bacteria (Chromatiales) and green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobiales), respectively. We show stable coexistence of phototrophic lineages from five bacterial phyla and present metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of two uncultured Chlorobaculum and Prosthecochloris species. In addition to genes involved in sulfur oxidation and photopigment biosynthesis the MAGs contained complete operons encoding for terminal oxidases. The metagenomes also contained numerous contigs affiliating with Microviridae viruses, potentially affecting Chlorobi. Our data suggest a short sulfur cycle within the bloom in which elemental sulfur produced by sulfide-oxidizing phototrophs is most likely reduced back to sulfide by Desulfuromonas sp. Conclusions The release of sulfide creates a habitat selecting for anoxygenic sulfur-oxidizing phototrophs, which in turn create a niche for sulfur reducers. Strong syntrophism between these guilds apparently drives a short sulfur cycle that may explain the rapid development of the bloom. The fast growth and high biomass yield of Chlorobi-affiliated organisms implies that the studied lineages of green sulfur bacteria can thrive in hypoxic habitats. This oxygen tolerance is corroborated by oxidases found in MAGs of uncultured Chlorobi. The findings improve our understanding of the ecology and ecophysiology of anoxygenic phototrophs and their impact on the coupled biogeochemical cycles of sulfur and carbon.",0.028

Joshua; Zhang, Ting; Galy, Valier; Wang, Xingchen Tony; Li, Shilei; Qiu, Hongrui; Li, Gaojun; Zhao, Liang; Chen, Jun; Ji, Junfeng","Fly ash-the residuum of coal burning-contains a considerable amount of fossilized particulate organic carbon (FOCash) that remains after high-temperature combustion. Fly ash leaks into natural environments and participates in the contemporary carbon cycle, but its reactivity and flux remained poorly understood. We characterized FOCash in the Chang Jiang (Yangtze River) basin, China, and quantified the riverine FOCash fluxes. Using Raman spectral analysis, ramped pyrolysis oxidation, and chemical oxidation, we found that FOCash is highly recalcitrant and unreactive, whereas shale-derived FOC (FOCrock) was much more labile and easily oxidized. By combining mass balance calculations and other estimates of fly ash input to rivers, we estimated that the flux of FOCash carried by the Chang Jiang was 0.21 to 0.42 Mt C center dot y-1 in 2007 to 2008-an amount equivalent to 37 to 72\% of the total riverine FOC export. We attributed such high flux to the combination of increasing coal combustion that enhances FOCash production and the massive construction of dams in the basin that reduces the flux of FOCrock eroded from upstream mountainous areas. Using global ash data, a first-order estimate suggests that FOCash makes up to 16\% of the present-day global riverine FOC flux to the oceans.

Oxygen poor and anoxic lake bottom conditions in estuarine brackish lakes Shinji and Nakaumi could prevent the oxidization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and preserve a record of PAHs in sediments. PAHs emitted from wood and/or grass burning have been analyzed for composition and concentrations during the last similar to 300 years. Carbonized plant material which remained after artificial agricultural fires and heating experiments have been used to estimate fire temperature. The equation relating maximum temperature and hydrogen to carbon (H/C) atomic ratio of the charcoal is as follows: Temp (degrees C) = 317 x (H/C)(-0708) (R-2 = 0.924, 200-700 degrees C). These experiments and the gas chromatography - mass spectrometry analysis of PAHs on the charcoals suggest that PAHs were primarily produced at temperatures less than 500 degrees C in the burning of wild plants. The PAHs contents in the two sediment cores were not related to total organic carbon (TOC) contents and emission of industrial waste, and were directly due to fire events in this region. Although TOC contents of the sediments were constant at about 0.5\% in Lake Shinji and 1.0\% in Lake Nakaumi before ca. 1900 CE, and increased up to about 4\% due to recent nutrient discharge, the profiles of PAHs contents were completely different. The sediment cores contained the following PAHs: phenanthrene (P), fluoranthene (Fla), pyrene (Py), benz{[}a]anthracene (BaAn), benzofluoranthenes (Bflas), benzo{[}e]pyrene (BePy), indeno{[}1,2,3-cd]pyrene (InPy) and benzo{[}ghi]perylene (BghiP). The contents of 6-ring InPy and BghiP, high temperature markers, are lower than those of the other low ring Py, BaAn, Bflas and BePy, showing low to medium intensity/temperature fire events. Relatively higher BaAn contents suggest that the PAHs were carried and deposited in the sediments for a short period after the fire. The PAHs peak groups B (1830-1870 CE) and C (1920 CE) may be attributed to the burning of wood buildings in Matsue City, and the PAHs peak group period D (1970-1980 and 2000-2007 CE) could be mainly due to forest fires. The general increase in PAHs after 1850 CE could be caused by climate change after the Little Ice Age. The PAHs with maximum total peak concentrations at 30-34 cm depth (1850 CE: 4890 ng g(-1)) in Lake Shinji and at 8-12 cm depth (1970-1980 CE: 2030 ng g(-1)) in Lake Nakaumi are not at a toxic level.",0.153

Moreover, we argue that the alien-invasive clams, instead of up-regulating energetically expensive cellular responses, have evolved a less demanding strategy to cope with short-term environmental (oxidative) stress-pervasive valve closure. Although efficient during stressful short-term periods to ensure isolation and guarantee longer survival, such adaptive behavioural strategy entails metabolic arrest (and the enhancement of anaerobic pathways), which to some extent will not be advantageous under the chronically warming conditions predicted in the future.

With reference to the Algerian - European relationships, we analyze the broad context where an environmental policy benefitting both developing and developed countries can be put in place. We then discuss the connection between anthropogenic CO2 emissions and acidification of Oceans along with a geo-engineering proposal aimed at solving these pressing problems with large-scale solar-powered chloralkali plants. While the cost of sequestering a ton of CO2 with dedicated chloralkali plants is unacceptably high, it is economically and environmentally sound to replace an existing European Cl-2 plant (consuming fossils) with a solar-powered plant in Algeria. If the Algerian plant uses a new, more efficient chloralkali process, it will be competitive with existing European plants even at the current low market value of the carbon emission credits. We finally explore the possibility of coupling Cl-2 production with CO2 reuse and syngas production through a novel electrochemical process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0.198

In order to study environmental and hydrodynamic impacts on the belugas' movements and survival in the unique habitat of the inlet, a three-dimensional ocean circulation and inundation model is combined with satellite-tracked beluga whale data. Model-wale data comparisons from two whale paths during a five-day period (september 17-21, 2000) covering 10 tidal cycles suggest that daily movements of belugas in the upper Cook Inlet follow propagation of the tides. Both whales took advantage of the twice-daily flood of mudflats by the very large tides (8-10 m range) to swim toward river mouths in shallow regions that are inaccessible during low tide. A significant correlation was found between whale locations and the model sea level. In the Knik Arm, north of Anchorage, ebbing and flooring rates are predictable, and the tracked whale followed the water velocity in direction and speed. However, in the Turnagain Arm, south of Anchorage, where a large change in topography along the arm causes nonlinear flooding and ebbing (including strong tidal bore currents with speeds up to 5 m s(-1)), the movement of the tracked whale was correlated only with the water level, not with the currents. The encouraging results from this study demonstrate the usefulness of the numerical model to help understand the belugas' behavior and will be followed by a more detailed study using a large tracking data set and longer simulations. Such a study will help to evaluate potential impacts of future changes such as shoreline development, which may change flood regions and the belugas' accessibility to their feeding areas.",0.085

The model reveals that there are two principal regions of uptake, the first in the region bounded by 35-45 degrees N and 140-180 degrees E, and the second along a band between 10-20 degrees N and between 120 degrees W and 180 degrees E. For both of these regions, the dominant timescale of variability in uptake is seasonal, with maximum uptake occurring during winter and uptake being close to zero or slightly negative during summer when integrated over the basin. A decadal trend toward increased uptake of anthropogenic CO2 consists largely of modulations of the uptake maximum in winter. For detection of anthropogenic changes, this implies that in situ measurements will need to resolve the seasonal cycle in order to capture decadal trends in Delta pCO(2). As uptake of anthropogenic CO2 occurs preferentially during winter, observationally based estimates which do not resolve the full seasonal cycle may result in underestimates of the rate of uptake of anthropogenic CO2. There is also a sizable circulation-driven decadal trend in the seasonal cycle of sea surface DpCO(2) for the North Pacific, with maximum changes found near the boundary separating the subtropical and subpolar gyres in western and central regions of the basin. These changes are due to a trend in the large-scale circulation of the gyres, which itself is driven by a trend in the wind stress over the basin scale. This trend in the three-dimensional circulation is more important than the local trend in mixed layer depth (MLD) in contributing to the decadal trend in DpCO(2).",0.041

Not only do their intimate experiences of seasonal weather conditions, tides and currents, species, and environmental indicators contribute to a better understanding of the nature, rate, and intensity of climate change, but TEK systems can potentially contribute to more effective planning and decision making regarding resilience and adaptation to climate change. Furthermore, the values of respect and recognition of kinship with other species that are often embodied in these systems can serve to remind all of us about the imperative to conserve and protect these other species if we are to survive as humans.

With a balanced panel dataset covering 30 provinces of mainland China from 1988 to 2019, we employed panel cointegrating polynomial regression (CPR) analysis using fully modified OLS (FM-OLS) estimators. Our results suggested that all provinces exhibit a long-run cointegrated relationship between fertilizer surpluses and real per capita gross regional product (GRP). A total of 22 provinces out of 30 showed a significant inverted U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). Among those, 14 provinces are considered to have reached the peak and 8 provinces are considered to be before the peak. The group-mean turning points on the EKC are CNY 7022, CNY 9726, CNY 4697, CNY 3749, and CNY 5588 per capita GRP (1978 = 100) for the Northeast, Northcentral, Middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, Southwest and Northwest China, respectively. The overall turning point of China is CNY 6705 per capita real gross domestic product (GDP), which was reached in circa 2012. This shows a general improvement of chemical fertilizer management in China. However, six provinces still exhibit linear growth in fertilizer surpluses when the economy grows. These regions are characterized by high cash-crop ratios and are mostly located along the southeast coast. Therefore, more effort and attention should be given to these regions to promote further fertilizer reduction. At the same time, nutrient use efficiencies should be improved, especially for cash crops such as fruit and vegetables.",0.104

Changes are already ongoing in Arctic systems, but there is a lack of coordinated monitoring of Arctic freshwaters that hinders our ability to assess changes in biodiversity. To address the need for coordinated monitoring on a circumpolar scale, the Arctic Council working group, Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna, established the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program, which is an adaptive monitoring program for the Arctic centred around four ecosystem themes (i.e., Freshwater, Terrestrial, Coastal, Marine). The freshwater theme developed a monitoring plan for Arctic freshwater biodiversity and recently completed the first assessment of status and trends in Arctic freshwater biodiversity. Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program-Freshwater has compiled and analysed a database of Arctic freshwater monitoring data to form the first report of the state of circumpolar Arctic freshwater biodiversity. This special issue presents the scientific analyses that underlie the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program-Freshwater report and provides analyses of spatial and temporal diversity patterns and the multiple-stressor scenarios that act on the biological assemblages and biogeochemistry of Arctic lakes and rivers. This special issue includes regional patterns for selected groups of organisms in Arctic rivers and lakes of northern Europe, Russia, and North America. Circumpolar assessments for benthic diatoms, macrophytes, plankton, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish demonstrate how climate change and associated environmental drivers affect freshwater biodiversity. Also included are papers on spatial and temporal trends in water chemistry across the circumpolar region, and a systematic review of documented Indigenous Knowledge that demonstrates its potential to support assessment and conservation of Arctic freshwaters. This special issue includes the first circumpolar assessment of trends in Arctic freshwater biodiversity and provides important baseline information for future assessments and studies. It represents the largest compilation and assessment of Arctic freshwater biodiversity data to date and strives to provide a holistic view of ongoing change in these ecosystems to support future monitoring efforts.

When coupled with sea level rise (SLR), poor urban development design, and loss of habitats, severe flooding often impacts the coastal zone. In order to protect citizens and adapt to a changing climate, national and local governments need to investigate their coastal vulnerability and climate change risks. To assess flood and inundation risk, some of the critical data are topography, bathymetry, and socio-economic. We review the datasets available for these parameters in Jamaica (and specifically Old Harbour Bay) and assess their pros and cons in terms of resolution and costs. We then examine how their use can affect the evaluation of the number of people and the value of infrastructure flooded in a typical sea level rise/flooding assessment. We find that there can be more than a three-fold difference in the estimate of people and property flooded under 3m SLR. We present an inventory of available environmental and economic datasets for modeling storm surge/SLR impacts and ecosystem-based coastal protection benefits at varying scales. We emphasize the importance of the careful selection of the appropriately scaled data for use in models that will inform climate adaptation planning, especially when considering sea level rise, in the coastal zone. Without a proper understanding of data needs and limitations, project developers and decision-makers overvalue investments in adaptation science which do not necessarily translate into effective adaptation implementation. Applying these datasets to estimate sea level rise and storm surge in an adaptation project in Jamaica, we found that less costly and lower resolution data and models provide up to three times lower coastal risk estimates than more expensive data and models, indicating that investments in better resolution digital elevation mapping (DEM) data are needed for targeted local-level decisions. However, we also identify that, with this general rule of thumb in mind, cost-effective, national data can be used by planners in the absence of high-resolution data to support adaptation action planning, possibly saving critical climate adaptation budgets for project implementation.",0.673

However, this approach is limited when uncertainty needs to be accounted for. In this paper, we assess coastal flood risk from sea-level rise and extreme events in 120 major cities around the world using an alternative stochastic approach that accounts for uncertainty. Probability distributions of future relative (local) sea-level rise have been used for each city, under three IPPC emission scenarios, RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. The approach allows a continuous stochastic function to be built to assess yearly evolution of damages from 2030 to 2100. Additionally, we present two risk measures that put low-probability, high-damage events in the spotlight: the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES), which enable the damages to be estimated when a certain risk level is exceeded. This level of acceptable risk can be defined involving different stakeholders to guide progressive adaptation strategies. The method presented here is new in the field of economics of adaptation and offers a much broader picture of the challenges related to dealing with climate impacts.

Filling the annular space around the waste containers with cement grout will support them during placement and seal against ingress of groundwater. The elevated temperature and pressure (similar to 120 degrees C and 50 MPa) will cause acceleration of grout thickening and setting, so retardation is required. The DBD Research Group at The University of Sheffield has developed grouts based on class G oil well cement that use organic retarders, but their presence may increase the solubility of any radionuclides released from the waste packages. New DBD grout formulations using sodium phosphate and sodium borate as inorganic retarders are reported in this paper. To place the wet grout, the onset of thickening needs to be delayed for at least 4 h. Sodium borate was found to provide this retardation at 90 degrees C (0.75\% addition) and nearly retarded sufficiently at 120 degrees C (1\% addition). Sodium phosphate did not provide sufficient retardation at either temperature. Neither compounds influenced the phases formed, but may suppress the crystallisation of calcium silicate hydrates.

It was established that the air temperature and precipitation, the temperature and salinity of sea waters and the hydrometeorological regime of the coastal zone and the water balance of the Black and Azov seas as well depends on climatic changes. The rising of the sea level has intensified over the past decades. These changes found a response in the coastal zone that reacted to them and acquired corresponding trends.

Results. The places (areas) with pronounced coastal dynamic processes on the Ukrainian coast of the Azov Sea were identified, that require special attention: two in the Kherson region, five in the Zaporozhye region and four in Donetsk.

When coupled with storm conditions, wave set-up - or, for brevity, set-up - can significantly increase the risk of flooding or structural damage and therefore is of particular importance when considering coastal management or issues related to the planning of nearshore infrastructures. Here, we investigate the effects of set-up in the coastal region of the Gulf of Finland in the Baltic Sea, close to Tallinn, Estonia, although the results will have wider relevance for many other areas. Due to a lack of continuous wave data we employ modelling to provide input data using a calculation scheme based on a high-resolution (470 m) spectral wave model WAM to replicate spatial patterns of wave properties based on high-quality, instrument-measured wind data from the neighbourhood of the study site. The results indicate that for the specific geometry of coastline under consideration, there is a variation in set-up which is strongly affected by wind direction. The maximum set-up values are up to 70-80 cm in selected locations. This is more than 50\% of the all-time maximum water level and thus may serve as a substantial source of marine hazard for several low-lying regions around the city. Wind directions during storms have changed in recent years and, with climate variability potentially increasing, these results will encourage further tests which may be used in a policy setting regarding defences or other structures in and around coastlines. In particular, with urban development now taking place in many coastal regions (including the one within this study) these results have implications for local planners.

However, knowledge of how the long-term presence of grazers affects soil carbon sequestration is limited. In this study, we estimated total accumulated organic carbon in soils of a back-barrier salt marsh and determined how this is affected by long-term grazing by both small and large grazers in relation to age of the ecosystem. In young marshes, where small grazers predominate, hare and geese have a limited effect on total accumulated organic carbon. In older, mature marshes, where large grazers predominate, cattle substantially enhanced carbon content in the marsh soil. We ascribe this to a shift in biomass distribution in the local vegetation towards the roots in combination with trampling effects on the soil chemistry. These large grazers thus act as ecosystem engineers: their known effect on soil compaction (based on a previous study) enhances anoxic conditions in the marsh soil, thereby reducing the oxygen available for organic carbon decomposition by the local microbial community. This study showed that the indirect effects of grazing can significantly enhance soil carbon storage through changing soil abiotic conditions. This process should be taken into account when estimating the role of ecosystems in reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Ultimately, we propose a testable conceptual framework that includes 3 pathways by which grazers can alter carbon storage: (1) through above-ground biomass removal, (2) through alteration of biomass distribution towards the roots and/or (3) by changing soil abiotic conditions that affect decomposition.",0.450

In contrast, co-benefits approaches to climate change mitigation and adaptation address climate change impacts on human and ecological health in tandem and on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The article engages the concept of co-benefits through four case studies. The case studies emphasize co-benefits approaches that are accessible and tractable in countries with human populations that are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. They illustrate the potential of co-benefits approaches and provide a platform for further discussion of several interdependent principles relevant to the implementation of co-benefits strategies. These principles include providing incentives across multiple scales and time frames, promoting long-term integrated impact assessment, and fostering multidimensional communication networks.",0.268

The Covenant of Mayors (CoM) is an initiative that tries to involve municipalities and communities in developing SECAPs, i.e., plans for sustainable energy and climate with the aim to develop adaptation and mitigation measures. In order to identify and evaluate hazards, the CoM developed a template relative to the current risk level and expected changes in the future. This paper develops a methodology to fill the template using a data driven approach instead of a heuristic one. The methodology was applied to the city of Trieste in northeast Italy and uses local weather station data and projections obtained from GCM-RCM models. Data were manipulated using different approaches for current risk levels and the Mann-Kendall test is proposed as a method to identify the future evolution of hazard intensity and frequency. The results showed that the developed approach could help municipalities in developing their SECAPs and in identifying the present and future evolution of hazards.",0.786

With mean sea levels expected to increase between 28 and 98 cm by the end of the century, and storms increasing in severity, accurate estimates of the consequences of those phenomena are needed. Recent advances in quality and availability of spatial data in Poland made possible the reassessment of previous estimates of inundation caused by sea level rise. Up-to-date, detailed information on land use, population and buildings was used here to calculate their exposure to floods at a broad range of scenarios. Inclusion of a high-resolution digital elevation model contributed to a further improvement in estimates. The results revealed that even by using a static ``bathtub fill{''} approach, the amount of exposed land, population or assets is significantly smaller than indicated in previous assessments. In the perspective of the twenty-first century, direct damages caused by sea level rise will be small and adaptation costs will not be significant. However, the increase in the frequency of storm surges could elevate the risk to the population and economy, but cost-effective flood protection measures would be able to mitigate the risk. The exposure of different kinds of assets and sectors of the economy varies to a large extent, though the structural breakdown of potential losses is remarkably stable between scenarios.",0.494

The initial mineralogy of the reservoir is frequently obtained from core analysis and is then used to compute the formation water composition. In this paper geochemical modelling with TOUGHREACT is used to predict and compare the short-and long-term geochemical impact of CO2 injection into three reservoirs. The mineralogical composition of these reservoirs is an assemblage based on commonly observed minerals from the Buntsandstein and Rotliegend formations. These formations contain potential onshore and offshore CO2 storage locations in the Netherlands. The results predict drying out and salt precipitation in the near-well area, due to water evaporation by the injected dry CO2. Several mineral transformations are predicted, dominated by the transformation of albite into dawsonite, thereby fixing CO2. Due to the relatively low density of dawsonite, the porosity significantly decreases, which can lead to a pore pressure increase. Disabling of dawsonite precipitation in the simulations, thereby taking into account the ongoing debate on dawsonite stability, only shows a small increase of the porosity. Future (experimental) work should be focused on dawsonite occurrence for accurate predictions of the long-term reservoir integrity. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",0.240

Firstly, a detailed literature review of existing techniques for wind speed estimation has been carried out, considering the most traditional methods (e.g. meteorological masts), remote sensing techniques and including a thorough review on the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) methods integrated with Geophysical Model Functions (GMFs) for wind speed retrieval. This review enables to identify CMOD5 (C Geophysical model function 5) as the best performing GMF overcoming the CMOD4 accuracy issues in high wind speed conditions. Thus, the method has been detailly described and showcased through the analysis of the case study. SAR images from the Sentinel 1 satellite have been processed by means of the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software. Afterwards, the wind speed and direction have been mapped through a Geographic Information System software.

In this work, climate change impacts on solar photovoltaic (PV) resources were evaluated in the Canary Islands, an orographically complex archipelago located in the sub-tropical Atlantic Ocean, using high resolution dynamical downscaling techniques. To alleviate the high computational cost of high resolution simulations, the pseudo-global warming technique was used to compute the initial and boundary conditions from a reanalysis dataset and from the monthly mean changes obtained by the simulations of fourteen global climate models included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Projections of annual-mean daily irradiation and PV potential were obtained for two future decades (2045-2054 and 2090-2099) and for two different greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), and the corresponding results were compared with those for a recent period (1995-2004). During winter, a generalized increase in PV potential is expected, as a consequence of a reduction in cloud cover. However, during summer, future simulations indicate a decrease in PV potential because of the rise of temperature and, therefore, a reduction in PV panel efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet the unequal effects of changes in ES, and of climate change more generally, on human well-being (HWB) are still poorly accounted for in decision-making around adaptation, particularly in tropical countries. Here, we investigate these dynamics through the lens of local peoples' perceptions of ES in relation to human well-being (HWB), and how these are affected by climate change in three distinct regional case studies in the Atlantic Forest in Southeast of Brazil. Through structured questionnaires, we found that the local perceptions of important ES are region-dependent, particularly identifying services regulating local climate and air quality, water flow and quality, food provisioning, and cultural services of landscape esthetics related to forest regeneration. HWB was expressed through material (e.g., economic security, environmental conditions) and higher accounts of non-material (e.g., feelings, health and social connections) dimensions. Specific environmental changes were identified by 95\% of those responding, 40\% of whom included climate change as one of these. When asked about climate directly, 97\% of those responding identified relevant changes in regionally relevant ways. Rising temperatures, unbalanced seasons, altered rainfall patterns, drought, increase of extreme events, and sea level rise are negatively affecting both material and non-material dimensions of HWB across regions. These perceived changes aligned with observed and projected climate changes in the regions. Benefits from ES accrue for HWB at different scales depending on the specific ES and region. For example, crop production by small farmers or exported in sugar cane, water captured for agricultural irrigation or used for urban supplies, and fish resources for local consumption and lifestyle or as a recreational attraction for visitors. Policy choices about such balances will affect local vulnerabilities to the expected future climate and other environmental changes in the region.

Humans rely on these coral reef ecosystems to provide significant ecological and economic resources; however, coral reefs are threatened by numerous local and global anthropogenic factors that cause significant environmental change. The interactions of these local and global human impacts may increase the rate of coral reef degradation. For example, there are many local influences (i.e., sedimentation and submarine groundwater discharge) that may exacerbate coral bleaching and mortality. Therefore, researchers and resource managers cannot limit their narratives and actions to mitigating a sole stressor. With the continued increase in greenhouse gas emissions, management strategies and restoration techniques need to account for the scale at which environmental change occurs. This review aims to outline the various local and global anthropogenic stressors threatening reef resiliency and address the recent disagreements surrounding present-day conservation practices. Unfortunately, there is no one solution to preserve and restore all coral reefs. Each coral reef region is challenged by numerous interactive stressors that affect its ecosystem response, recovery, and services in various ways.

We hypothesized that this assessment of ecosystem metabolism is incomplete as it does not include information on energy inputs from microalgae, which form complex biofilms with heterotrophic micro-organisms on the peat surface. To investigate the potential for algae (and associated exudates) to support heterotrophic metabolism under ambient and elevated nutrient levels, we conducted a factorial enrichment of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and carbon (glucose) in mesocosms with and without the presence of algae (using light-transparent and dark treatments, respectively) in an Alaskan fen. We measured respiration rates and changes in bacterial biomass to characterize the response of heterotrophic bacteria to our experimental treatments. During incubation assays, algae released up to 38\% of their net productivity as exudates and there was a positive relationship between algal production and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon inside mesocosms. Elevated algal productivity in the presence of nutrient enrichment stimulated heterotrophic bacterial respiration and biomass. These responses did not occur with nutrient enrichment in the dark (without algae). The response of bacteria to algae was similar in magnitude to bacterial responses to glucose enrichment.Synthesis. We conclude that bacteria in this boreal fen were primarily limited by labile carbon, and this constraint was alleviated in the presence of elevated algal production. Consequently, algae may facilitate hotspots of microbial activity in northern peatlands, especially in conditions of greater nutrient availability associated with more variable hydrology expected for this region with ongoing climate change.",0.144

Our goal was to develop a cost-effective, appropriately-scaled, model-based approach that allows planners to predict, under various sea level rise and response scenarios, the economic cost of wetland loss-with the estimates proxied by the costs of future restoration required to maintain the existing level of wetland habitat services. Our approach applies the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model to predict changes in wetland habitats over the next century, and then applies Habitat Equivalency Analysis to predict the cost of restoration projects required to maintain ecological services at their present, pre-sea level rise level.

Over the past few decades, the region has become one of the fastest warming spots on the planet, has seen significant growth in coastal populations, and expansion of new sectors into the marine environment, resulting in ecosystem shifts and changes to the supply and distribution of these benefits. With these changes comes a need for measuring ocean health to understand how engagement with the ocean may be affected, and how regional management may need to adapt. To address this need, we tailored the Ocean Health Index framework to the U.S. Northeast region, scoring eight distinct goals for ocean health on a scale of 0 to 100 for 11 sub-regions over 13 years (2005-2017). All goal scores were averaged resulting in an Ocean Health Index score of 83 for the Northeast in 2017. This score fluctuated by 1 point in either direction (82-84) in the previous 12 years. The lowest scoring goals in 2017 also exhibited the highest volatility since 2005, Food Provision (64) and Resource Access Opportunities (71). The region's highest goal scores came from Livelihoods \& Economies (99) and Biodiversity (90) and remained stable during the study period. Clean Waters scores had a steady, significant downward trend since 2005, while Resource Access Opportunities and Aquaculture show the largest improvements. This synthesis of over 50 datasets to create annual aggregate scores provides the public, government and non-government agencies with an easily digestible summary of how the region is faring in regards to ocean health. Perhaps even more importantly, this synthesis allows for the tracking of trends over time and the ability to quickly identify and prioritize low-scoring components of ocean health that could benefit from dedicated resources for improvement. As managers plan for the future in a changing Northeast marine region, the ability to track annual changes in ocean health and its respective components is key to making decisions that benefit the entire social-ecological system.

The main goal of the current experimental investigation is the evaluation of such a system for operation at variable power input and the increase of fresh water production as a function of the power input conditions. An RO desalination unit can be powered by renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy. However, the power that derives from these sources can strongly fluctuate, since it depends on the weather conditions and/or available solar radiation. As the available power production fluctuates, the water feed and the production of permeate also fluctuate. Therefore, flexibility concerning the RO unit is required, in order to operate efficiently, ensuring the good quality (low salinity) of the produced fresh water. A configuration of three identical sub-systems using an energy recovery unit of axial piston motor - APM type has been chosen, in order to ensure flexibility at variable load operation. The number of the sub-units that operate depends on the available power. The total RO unit capacity is 2.1 m(3)/h of fresh water. All the components have been equipped with the appropriate instrumentation for detailed experimental testing. The laboratory experimental testing uses frequency inverters in order to simulate the variable power input. The power input has been monitored through the control of the high pressure pump frequency. The RO unit has been tested for seawater salinity of 37,500 ppm, and for different seawater temperature. An efficient performance of the RO unit is achieved due to the on/off switching of the three sub-units, keeping an acceptable fresh water quality at both part and full load operation. The application of such flexible RO unit has been then examined and demonstrated in three different case studies, using local weather data. The power input originated from photovoltaics (PV) of capacity ranging from 10 up to 20 kWp, showing that it is suitable to combine RO with renewable energy sources with strong intermittent power production.

Although Mexico has suitable offshore wind energy harvesting sites, technical assessments to identify technologies to be placed in specific locations are scarce. In Mexico, offshore wind resources are found in depths larger than 50 m. There, floating platforms are convenient for harnessing wind energy. This work presents a technical evaluation of offshore wind energy in one of the regions with a higher availability of wind resources on the Mexican coasts, the Tehuantepec Gulf, in the Pacific Ocean. First, a specific location is chosen to evaluate its maritime conditions and theoretical wind energy potential. Next, the performance of a floating offshore wind turbine platform has been investigated numerically using potential flow simulations. The motions of the platform were analyzed for different drafts when subjected to different environmental conditions in the evaluated region. These conditions include wave and wind scenarios with the highest probability of occurrence and the most extreme ones. From the evaluation of the platform dynamics in these scenarios, it was possible to identify the general working conditions of the platform. Results showed that the proposed FOWT could be suitable to be deployed in the region of interest for the most probable environmental conditions, presenting a possible energy production within 3-4 MW, approximately. However, motion stabilization should be required when subjected to extreme environmental conditions as the structure could significantly increase its surge and pitch motions.

The Time-varying Emulator for Short- and Long-Term analysis of coastal flood hazard potential is presented here as a methodology capable of producing new iterations of the sea-state parameters associated with the present-day Pacific Ocean climate to simulate many synthetic extreme compound events. The emulator utilizes weather typing of fundamental climate drivers (sea surface temperatures, sea level pressures, etc.) to reduce complexity and produces new daily synoptic weather chronologies with an auto-regressive logistic model accounting for conditional dependencies on the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the Madden-Julian Oscillation, seasonality, and the prior two days of weather progression. Joint probabilities of sea-state parameters unique to simulated weather patterns are used to create new time series of the hypothetical components contributing to synthetic total water levels (swells from multiple directions coupled with water levels due to wind setup, temperature anomalies, and tides).

The installation cost is a crucial factor of the investment. With the increasing number of planned and approved offshore wind farms, offshore wind turbine installation and relevant operations have received tremendous attention. Therefore, expediting the turbine-structure mating operations through a higher level of automation in offshore wind turbine installations may provide important economic benefits. To achieve a higher automation level and reduce the weather waiting time during the installation of offshore wind turbines, a flexible simulation-verification framework with high fidelity is needed. However, state-of-the-art wind turbine numerical analysis code is neither convenient nor open enough for applications concerning the design and verification of control algorithms. MATLAB/Simulink is among the most widely utilized numerical platforms by control engineers and researchers. This paper describes the development of a modularized blade installation simulation toolbox for the purpose of control design in MATLAB/Simulink. The toolbox can be used to simulate several blade installation configurations, both onshore and offshore. The paper presents the key features and equations of the different modules, exemplified by a single blade installation operation. Code-to-code verification results are presented and discussed with both quasi-steady wind and three-dimensional turbulent wind field.",0.810

End-of-pipe measures have been implemented to mitigate air pollutant emissions in different industrial sectors. However, interregional trade can lead to geological separation of the stages of supply chains (i.e., primary input, production, final sale and consumption), and thus, emissions can be driven by cross-regional drivers (i.e., primary inputs, final sales and consumption), and pollutants can transfer among regions via supply chains. Inequity exists in production-side measures of emission reductions, which do not account for the effects of cross-regional drivers. In this study, we use a multiregional input-output model in the year 2012 to calculate the emissions driven by cross-regional drivers and to trace emission flows along supply chains in China, aiming to inform policymaking on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) mitigation and to provide additional information about shared responsibilities among provinces. We find that the Central (including Anhui and Henan) is the largest emitter outside the Central Coast in order to meet the demand for sales within the Central Coast. Specifically, the cross-provincial sale of products from the construction sector drives massive emissions, especially in Jiangsu province (located in the Central Coast). Therefore, the Central Coast should bear some responsibility to help provinces located in the Central reduce emissions. About half of emissions driven by primary inputs in Beijing-Tianjin are emitted in other regions. However, in general, emissions (except for ammonia) are more likely to be driven by final sales of other provinces than by primary inputs. The supply chain perspective can help gain a better understanding of the impacts of trade-related drivers on emission patterns and advocate just and effective policies considering cleaner production and shared responsibilities.

Luke; Westra, John V.","Coastal communities along the United States coast often experience significant economic damage resulting from the impacts of tropical storms and hurricanes. Research suggests that certain factors that affect economic damages are increasing the vulnerability of coastal communities. Population growth, which increases vulnerability by placing valuable lives and assets in the path of storms, is expected to increase. Climate change has the potential to cause more frequent and intense storms, and coastal wetland loss is contributing to the vulnerability of coastal populations. Wetlands conservation and restoration is often advocated for as a means of reducing the impacts of coastal storms. The relationship between wetlands and storm surge energy is understood relatively well in physical terms, but very little economic analysis has been conducted to estimate the degree to which wetlands reduce economic impacts. Using factor analysis, the relationships among coastal populations, wetlands, storm intensity, and economic damage are explored. The factor analysis suggests that wetland presence is associated with a reduction in economic damages from coastal storms. Factor score analysis suggests that the proportion of damage explained by wetland presence is smaller for more intense storms. These results are consistent with those found in the physical science literature and have potentially large consequences for how wetlands are used in risk reduction.",0.892

Since coastal areas are both economically and socially important, monitoring shoreline changes has become one of the important research areas. Monitoring short-term and long-term changes in coastal areas is important to prevent damages that may occur due to natural and human factors and protect the shorelines. In this study, which is an important tourist city of Antalya, Turkey, and the world, coastal changes using historical and recent satellite data have been analyzed. The focus of the study is to analyze long-term coastal change with Landsat data and the data obtained every 5 years between 1985 and 2020 and to analyze short-term change with annual Sentinel-2 data between 2015 and 2020. In the study, water areas on the coastline were determined by object-based classification and multiresolution segmentation method with the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). The obtained shorelines were analyzed with the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) tool and the changes in the coastal areas were determined statistically. Five-year and 35-year changes were compared with Linear Regression Rate (LRR) and End Point Rate (EPR) analyses. As a result of the study, when the Pearson's r value between EPR and LRR was examined, r was found 0.916 and 0.944 for 5-year and 35-year data, respectively. Spatial resolution in satellite images is vital for shoreline detection. However, the most optimal way to detect long-term changes in the shoreline is to use Landsat data. Although the spatial resolution of Landsat data, it has been observed that the power to analyze annual variation differences is lower than Sentinel-2.",0.085

In this paper, we explore how water-level fluctuations affect the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms, and based on the observations from case studies, we discuss the options and pitfalls to use water-level fluctuations for lake and reservoir management. A drawdown in summer causes an increase in retention time and increased water column nutrient concentrations and temperature of shallow water layers, which may lead to severe cyanobacterial blooms. This effect can potentially be counteracted by the positive response of submerged macrophytes, which compete for nutrients with cyanobacteria, with a higher chance of cyanobacterial blooms under eutrophic conditions. The balance between dominance by submerged macrophytes or cyanobacteria is temperature sensitive with stronger positive effects of drawdown as inhibition of cyanobacterial blooms expected in colder climates. Complete drying out reduces the amount of cyanobacteria in the water column after refilling, with lower water nutrient concentrations, lower fish biomass, lower abundance of cyanobacteria, higher transparency, and higher cover of submerged plants compared to lakes and reservoirs that did not dry out. Water-level rise as response to flooding has contrasting effects on the abundance of cyanobacteria depending on water quality. We conclude that water-level fluctuation management has potential to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms. However, the success will depend strongly on ecosystem properties, including morphometry, sediment type, water retention time, quality of inlet water, presence of submerged vegetation or propagules, abundance of fish, and climate.",0.245

One of its outcomes is the definition of the optimized locations for groundwater withdrawal. Such a tool permits the analysis of alternative plans for groundwater extraction and the sustainable use of water resources in a coastal aquifer subject to saltwater intrusion. The principal components are the evolutionary optimization and the analytical/numerical simulation models. The optimization technique looks for the best well locations taking into consideration the economic results and the satisfaction of the societal water demand. However these two concerns are conditioned by trying to control the saltwater intrusion, i.e., preserving the environmental equilibrium. The simulation model uses the governing mathematical equations for groundwater movement to find the interface between freshwater and saltwater. Because of the non-linearity in the system and the possibility of a jumping interface, a security distance was defined. This is a controlling variable which can be set by the decision makers. The model was applied to a typical case with interesting results. For example, diagrams showing the relationship between the location of the wells and the security distance(s) are of importance to the managers. It was also crucial to have an understanding of the tradeoffs between groundwater withdrawals, positions of the wells from the coast line, and the security distance. The model was also applied to a real case in order to relate the extractions, distances and artificial recharge (not presented in this paper).",0.440

These frequent occurrences of floods severely affect one or other parts of the country. In reducing disaster risk and strengthening local initiatives towards climate adaptation, vulnerable communities particularly in rural areas have developed valuable local knowledge for flood resilience. This local knowledge is continuously practiced in facing disasters and it is passed down to the next generations. This study aims to examine measures taken by communities based on local knowledge they possessed from the three stages of disaster management cycle namely, before, during and after disaster. Local knowledge as asserted by scholars could complement scientific knowledge and build a comprehensive disaster risk reduction approach for local context implementation. A mixed method approach was adopted; case study method and household survey involving 90 respondents for quantitative data collection and field observation for collecting qualitative data. Three case study areas in East Coast of Malaysia have been selected for further observation including; 1) Lubok Setol village in Kelantan state; 2) Teladas village in Terengganu state; and 3) Gajah Mati village in Pahang state. Findings from this study indicated that all study cases have developed and adopted local knowledge strategies for flood preparedness and responses including; 1) agriculture techniques and livestock trading; 2) stock piling of food and other necessities; 3) marking flood level as historical record; 4) floodproofing animal shelter; 5) constructing overhead storage cabinet and outdoor hut, and; 6) saving boats for emergencies. As a conclusion, it is proven that local community knowledge plays crucial roles in reducing disaster risks hence contributing towards building a resilient community. (C) 2022 Penerbit UTM Press.

Data from CRC meetings provide insights into the policy-formation process and related policy outcomes associated with long-term ecological and social concerns, specifically related to sea-level rise. Findings indicate that the CRC continually developed policies and fashioned regulatory decisions that favored economic growth over environmental protection. Importantly, the CRC failed to prepare for the long-term effects of climate change, such as sea-level rise.

Results from a seven month field survey which monitored chemical and hydraulic parameters, indicate fresh groundwater is continuously discharged from these features. Porewater measured from both groundwater springs (GWS) had consistently low salinity (0.07 +/- 0.04 psu), pH (5) and high oxidation reduction potential (ORP; 194 mV) relative to the adjacent intertidal area (27.8 +/- 16.7 psu; 6.8 PH; -92.3 +/- 123.2 mV). Positive ORP, which suggests high dissolved oxygen, combined with lower concentrations of ammonium (N-NH4+) and higher concentrations of nitrate (N-NO3-) relative to the intertidal area, reveal that these sites transport and cycle nutrients differently than the surrounding beach. The C:N:P ratio from the GWS sites differs significantly (p <0.05) from the rest of the intertidal zone, with lower C:N and higher N:P ratios measured from the GWS relative to the rest of the intertidal zone. The unique geochemical characteristics of the GWS sites appear to influence the abundance and species assemblage of the local phytoplankton community. Diatom assemblages from the two GWS were taxonomically distinct to the diatom assemblage of the surrounding intertidal zone. A total of 25 taxa were identified within the entire field area. Of these, four were unique to freshwater habitats and found only at the GWS. Based on the differences in nutrient and geochemical composition between the GWS sites and the adjacent intertidal porewater, two scenarios explaining the source of the GWS are further hypothesized.

The modeling results from two numerical simulation runs provide new insights on the formation of downwind vortex streets and the adjustment of coastal processes, such as upwelling and stratification. The distorted farm-induced wind deficits are calculated by the concept of single-and multiple-wake models. By assuming farm geometry as a large rigid rectangle, the numerical results of a shallow water model demonstrate the formation of vortex shedding wakes in the downwind of the wind farm. The slice model simulation runs, as the second numerical experiment, will address the coastal upwelling and geostrophic adjustment of density fronts in the presence of wind farm effects over a sloping bathymetry. We apply gravity wave effects using a wave-dependent aerodynamic roughness length when assuming the wind farm as an array of multiple turbines. Despite dynamical differences between simulation runs assuming farm as a rigid element and those considering farm as a cluster of single turbines, the results show some aspects of the farm-induced modulations on the pycnocline displacements and on the spatial-temporal evolution of the coastal upwelling. Although each simulation run has a unique scientific focus, the overall achieved numerical results are greatly able to improve the understanding of physical coupling between the wind farms and upper ocean dynamical processes.

Integrated views of human-nature relations as well as tools and frameworks for studying these relations are gaining ground. A socio-ecological systems (SES) perspective therefore embraces both social and environmental factors that uses nonlinearities, feedbacks, models, and multi-level networks for understanding and studying those phenomena. When undesired drivers as climate change are also taken into account, the most urgent question is how these critical socio-ecological systems will behave given the stresses they endure. This work had the objective of creating a new simulation of a coastal SES from Brazil that is able to integrate several climatic and social variables through a dynamic and coupled model, and forecast its behavior in the future according to scenarios. Specifically, a systems dynamics simulation model using MIMES (Multiscale Integrated Model of Ecosystem Services) was developed for Ubatuba, a coastal city highly dependent and influenced by tourism. Results showed good correspondence between the model and the data when testing several environmental inputs (wind speed and direction, cloud cover, sea surface temperature, precipitation patterns). The model simulated the population dynamics of 15 biological groups from 2010 to 2100 under different scenarios. Climate change will reduce most of populations in a range from-0.13\% (+/- 0.0\%) to-10.31\% (+/- 0.0\%). There are groups where the influence of climate change is not significant (Bivalve, Brachyuran, pelagic feeding fish and benthic feeding fish) with variations from 0 to 2\% and others with moderate significance (Phytoplankton, Zooplankton, and Enterococcus) with variations > 2\%. Tourists reacting to water quality degradation is very relevant in Enterococcus population (with a reduction of 34\%). Results show the urban activities strongly influencing the biological populations and that these impacts depend on the scenario context. This suggests a policy that limits the number of tourists and increases the water quality at the same time. Therefore, the model's spatial simulation of this complex socio-ecological system can be used to develop an integrative decision-making tool to help the city manage its natural capital and adapt to its changes.",0.558

While blue carbon systems (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) are efficient at long-term sequestration of organic carbon (C), much of their sequestered C may originate from other (allochthonous) habitats. Macroalgae, due to their high rates of production, fragmentation, and ability to be transported, would also appear to be able to make a significant contribution as C donors to blue C habitats. In order to assess the stability of macroalgal tissues and their likely contribution to long-term pools of C, we applied thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to 14 taxa of marine macroalgae and coastal vascular plants. We assessed the structural complexity of multiple lineages of plant and tissue types with differing cell wall structures and found that decomposition dynamics varied significantly according to differences in cell wall structure and composition among taxonomic groups and tissue function (photosynthetic vs. attachment). Vascular plant tissues generally exhibited greater stability with a greater proportion of mass loss at temperatures >300 degrees C (peak mass loss similar to 320 degrees C) than macroalgae (peak mass loss between 175-300 degrees C), consistent with the lignocellulose matrix of vascular plants. Greater variation in thermogravimetric signatures within and among macroalgal taxa, relative to vascular plants, was also consistent with the diversity of cell wall structure and composition among groups. Significant degradation above 600 degrees C for some macroalgae, as well as some belowground seagrass tissues, is likely due to the presence of taxon-specific compounds. The results of this study highlight the importance of the lignocellulose matrix to the stability of vascular plant sources and the potentially significant role of refractory, taxon-specific compounds (carbonates, long-chain lipids, alginates, xylans, and sulfated polysaccharides) from macroalgae and seagrasses for their long-term sedimentary C storage.

Here we use mark-resight data from 2000 to 2018 to examine the effects of environmental variability on age-specific survival and natality for the endangered western distinct population segment (wDPS) of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in Alaska, USA. Though this population has been studied extensively over the last four decades, the causes of divergent abundance trends that have been observed across the wDPS range remain unknown. We developed a Bayesian multievent mark-resight model that accounts for female reproductive state uncertainty. Annual survival probabilities for male pups (0.44; 0.36-0.53), female yearlings (0.63; 0.49-0.73), and male yearlings (0.62; 0.51-0.71) born in the western portion of the wDPS range, estimated here for the first time, were lower than those in the eastern portion of the wDPS range, estimated as: male pups (0.69; 0.65-0.74), female yearlings (0.76; 0.71-0.81), and male yearlings (0.71; 0.65-0.78). There was a higher proportion of young female breeders in the western portion of the range, but overall natality was lower (0.69; 0.47-0.96) than in the eastern portion of the range (0.80; 0.74-0.84). Additionally, pup mass had a positive effect on pup survival in the eastern portion of the range and a negative effect in the western portion of the range, potentially due to earlier weaning of heavier pups. Local- and basin-scale oceanographic features such as the Aleutian Low, the Arctic Oscillation Index, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, chlorophyll concentration, upwelling, and wind in certain seasons were correlated with vital rates. However, drawing strong inferences from these correlations is challenging given that relationships between ocean conditions and an adaptive top predator in a dynamic ecosystem are exceedingly complex.

Its osmoregulation pattern and variations in its tolerance to salinity are partially known from several studies under different experimental conditions (developmental stages, salinities and acclimation procedures). Although L. vannamei is recognized as one of the most euryhaline penaeid species, with adults and juveniles exhibiting a hyper-hypo-osmoregulatory pattern and being able to tolerate a wide salinity range, little is known on larval and early postlarval strategies to cope with salinity fluctuations. In order to establish their euryhalinity range and to fully understand the ontogenetic changes in L. vannamei osmoregulatory pattern, we evaluated the effect of six salinities (5, 10, 20, 32, 45 and 60 psu) on 17 developmental stages by directly exposing them to experimental salinities and conducting observations during the next 48 h.

Anthropogenic pressures, including climate change, are causing nonlinear changes in ecosystems globally. The development of reliable early warning indicators (EWIs) to predict these changes is vital for the adaptive management of ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity, natural capital and ecosystem services. Increased variance and autocorrelation are potential early warning indicators and can be readily estimated from ecological time series. Here, we undertook a comprehensive test of the consistency between early warning indicators and nonlinear abundance change across species, trophic levels and ecosystem types. 2. We tested whether long-term abundance time series of 55 taxa (126 data sets) across multiple trophic levels in marine and freshwater ecosystems showed (i) significant nonlinear change in abundance `turning points' and (ii) significant increases in variance and autocorrelation ('early warning indicators'). For each data set, we then quantified the prevalence of three cases: true positives (early warning indicators and associated turning point), false negatives (turning point but no associated early warning indicators) and false positives (early warning indicators but no turning point). 3. True positives were rare, representing only 9\% (16 of 170) of cases using variance, and 13\% (19 of 152) of cases using autocorrelation. False positives were more prevalent than false negatives (53\% vs. 38\% for variance; 47\% vs. 40\% for autocorrelation). False results were found in every decade and across all trophic levels and ecosystems. 4. Time series that contained true positives were uncommon (8\% for variance; 6\% for autocorrelation), with all but one time series also containing false classifications. Coherence between the types of early warning indicators was generally low with 43\% of time series categorized differently based on variance compared to autocorrelation. 5. Synthesis and applications. Conservation management requires effective early warnings of ecosystem change using readily available data, and variance and autocorrelation in abundance data have been suggested as candidates. However, our study shows that they consistently fail to predict nonlinear change. For early warning indicators to be effective tools for preventative management of ecosystem change, we recommend that multivariate approaches of a suite of potential indicators are adopted, incorporating analyses of anthropogenic drivers and process-based understanding.",0.506

Design Cross-sectional study of the Solomon Islands' populations. Setting A field survey was conducted in Taro Island, a small, urbanised island with a whole-community relocation plan; Manuopo community of Reef Islands, a small remote island on an atoll environment and Sasamungga, an intermediately urbanised community on a larger island. The Sasamungga community was used for comparison. Participants Each community's participants were recruited through local health authorities, and 113, 155 and 116 adults (aged 18+ years) from Taro, Manuopo and Sasamungga, respectively, participated voluntarily. Methods Each participant's body height, weight and body mass index were measured. A drop of blood was sampled for malaria testing; glycated haemoglobin and C reactive protein levels, measured from another drop of blood, were markers for diabetes and inflammation, respectively. The Primary Care Screening Questionnaire for Depression measured depressive mental states. Primary and secondary outcome measures Regarding health status, the dependent variables-communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases and mental state-and independent variables-differences in communities and socioeconomic status-were measured through health check-ups and interviews of individual participants. Results Taro Island inhabitants had a higher risk of obesity (OR 1.13, 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.27, p=0.0189), and Manuopo inhabitants had a higher risk of depression (1.25, 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.44, p=0.0026) than Sasamungga inhabitants. Manuopo inhabitants recognised more serious problems of food security, livelihood, place to live and other aspects of daily living than other communities' inhabitants. Conclusions The three small island communities' observation identified different health problems: the urbanised community and remote community had a high risk of non-communicable diseases and mental disorders, respectively. These health problems should be monitored continuously during future climate-related changes.",0.723

Differences in biochemical traits of phytoplankton between ice-free and polar night periods were investigated in biweekly water samples obtained at the Korean ``Jang Bogo Station{'' located in Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica. The average concentration of total Chl-a from phytoplankton dominated by micro-sized species from the entire sampling period was 0.32 mu g L-1 (SD = +/- 0.88 mu g L-1), with the highest concentration of 4.29 mu g L-1 in February and the lowest concentration of 0.01 mu g L-1 during the ice-covered polar night (April-October) in 2015. The highest protein concentration coincided with the peak Chl-a concentration in February and decreased rapidly relative to the carbohydrate and lipid concentrations in the early part of polar night. Among the different biochemical components, carbohydrates were the predominant constituent, accounting for 69\% (SD = +/- 14\%) of the total particulate organic matter (POM) during the entire study period. The carbohydrate contributions to the total POM markedly increased from 39 +/- 8\% during the ice-free period to 73 +/- 9\% during the polar night period. In comparison, while we found a significant negative correlation (r(2) = 0.92, p < 0.01) between protein contributions and carbohydrate contributions, lipid contributions did not show any particular trend with relatively small temporal variations during the entire observation period. The substantial decrease in the average weight ratio of proteins to carbohydrates from the ice-free period (mean +/- SD = 1.0 +/- 0.3) to the ice-covered period (mean +/- SD = 0.1 +/- 0.1) indicates a preferential loss of nitrogen-based proteins compared to carbohydrates during the polar night period. Overall, the average food material (FM) concentration and calorific contents of FM in this study were within the range reported previously from the Southern Ocean. The results from this study may serve as important background data for long-term monitoring of the regional and interannual variations in the physiological state and biochemical compositions of phytoplankton resulting from future climate change in Antarctica.",0.073

Michael","Tourism is a major global economic sector that is undergoing tremendous growth in emerging economies and is often touted as salient for development and poverty alleviation in developing countries. Tourism is recognized as a highly climate-sensitive sector, one that is also strongly influenced by environmental and socioeconomic change influenced by climate change, and is also a growing contributor to anthropogenic climate change. This article outlines the complex interrelationships between climate change and the multiple components of the international tourism system. Five focal themes that have developed within the literature on the consequences of climate change for tourism are then critically reviewed: climatic change and temporal and geographic shifts in tourism demand, climate-induced environmental change and destination competitiveness within three major market segments (winter sports tourism, coastal tourism, and nature-based tourism), and mitigation policy developments and future tourist mobility. The review highlights the differential vulnerability of tourism destinations and that the resultant changes in competitiveness and sustainability will transform some international tourism markets. Feedbacks throughout the tourism system mean that all destinations will need to adapt to the risks and opportunities posed by climate change and climate policy. While notable progress has been made in the last decade, a number of important knowledge gaps in each of the major impact areas, key regional knowledge gaps, and both tourist and tourism operator perceptions of climate change risks and adaptive capacity indicate that the tourism sector is not currently well prepared for the challenges of climate change.

Fertilizing the central gyres would require enormous amounts of N and P fertilizer. Addition of iron to the Southern Ocean has been rejected as inefficient. The deep sea disposal of 50-100\% of fossil fuel CO2 would suppress the predicted transient peak of atmospheric CO2 but eventually the atmospheric CO2 level will be the same as without, unless rapid buffering by dissolution of calcite is significant. Ocean disposal applies only to point sources representing approximately 30\% of fossil fuel emissions; relocation of these plants to maritime regions may not be economical either. Also ocean disposal costs approximately 30-45\% of the energy produced. Current research is focusing on production and oceanic mixing behaviour of the effluent stream (this volume). In this paper the fate of the disposed CO2 is assessed. The various proposed forms appear chemically unstable relative to ambient seawater. However the higher CO2 contents of seawater might lead to part of the CO2 being buffered forever through enhanced dissolution of existing calcite deposits. The predicted impact depends on the selected rate constant of latter dissolution. Ocean dumping is a fallback option, in case the sensible options of energy conservation and shifting to other energy sources would not be implemented adequately. Latter options would require societal and economic adaptations but appear the most efficient, if not inevitable, policy for imminent reduction of CO2 emissions.",0.429

A BACI (Before-After Control-Impact) analysis failed to detect any significant interaction between period (before, during, and after dredging) and the category of the stations (impact vs. control). Among the 31 stations surveyed, only seven showed decreasing coral cover during the study period, mainly due to a decline in Acroporidae. However, the relationship between the dredging and this decrease was highly plausible only for one station, situated 0.9 km from the dredging site. High hydrodynamism in the study area, the abundance of resistant corals and efficient protective measures during the dredging operation might explain these localised and limited impacts.

Decision makers need to recognize and adopt strategies to adapt to the potentially detrimental effects of SLR. Structured decision making (SDM) provides a rigorous framework for the management of natural resources. The aim of SDM is to identify decisions that are optimal with respect to management objectives and knowledge of the system. Most applications of SDM have assumed that the managed systems are governed by stationary processes. However, in the context of SLR it may be necessary to acknowledge that the processes underlying managed systems may be non-stationary, such that systems will be continuously changing. Therefore, SLR brings some unique considerations to the application of decision theory for natural resource management. In particular, SLR is expected to affect each of the components of SDM. For instance, management objectives may have to be reconsidered more frequently than under more stable conditions. The set of potential actions may also have to be adapted over time as conditions change. Models have to account for the non-stationarity of the modeled system processes. Each of the important sources of uncertainty in decision processes is expected to be exacerbated by SLR. We illustrate our ideas about adaptation of natural resource management to SLR by modeling a non-stationary system using a numerical example. We provide additional examples of an SDM approach for managing species that may be affected by SLR, with a focus on the endangered Florida manatee.",0.904

Using remotely sensed PIC and chlorophyll data, we investigate the seasonal dynamics of coccolithophores relative to a mixed phytoplankton community. Seasonal variability in PIC, here considered to indicate changes in coccolithophore biomass, is identified across much of the global ocean. Blooms, which typically start in February-March in the low-latitude (similar to 30 degrees) Northern Hemisphere and last for similar to 6-7months, get progressively later (April-May) and shorter (3-4months) moving poleward. A similar pattern is observed in the Southern Hemisphere, where blooms that generally begin around August-September in the lower latitudes and which last for similar to 8months get later and shorter with increasing latitude. It has previously been considered that phytoplankton blooms consist of a sequential succession of blooms of individual phytoplankton types. Comparison of PIC and chlorophyll peak dates suggests instead that in many open ocean regions, blooms of coccolithophores and other phytoplankton can co-occur, conflicting with the traditional view of species succession that is thought to take place in temperate regions such as the North Atlantic.",0.118

The discussion in this paper largely differs from the understanding of the concept both by the planning institution and the majority of academic studies. While the planning institution approaches the transfer of property rights as a passive ingredient, academic studies focus mainly on the outcomes of this transfer in economic terms and they fail in defining the necessary strategies, policies, and regulatory tools to decrease risk and negative impacts. The alternative approach presented in this paper suggests that property rights as a creative approach and policy tool for urban resilience should be examined on the basis of the relationship between partial interests in property; relative to value, land use, the location and the amount and type of real property transactions. A coastal region in Turkey where all types of historical, cultural, and natural resources are concentrated, but rapidly destroyed with the pressure of tourism, energy investments, and secondary housing is selected as a case for the analysis of the effects of the property market with the planning/urbanization problems in the region. The case study takes into account the internet data of transfer values by property types in the year 2008. The case study is used for presenting an administrative model that is implemented through and understanding for spatial planning to achieve urban resilience. This understanding is based on the concepts of integrated coastal zone and protection area management that are realized by controlling and directing transfers in order to limit the impact of the market and planning institutions.

Rodger; Taylor, Karen A.","The Hanna Shoal region represents an important northern gateway for transport and deposition in the Chukchi Sea. This study determined the concentration and distribution of organic contaminants (aliphatic hydrocarbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) in surface sediments from 34 sites across Hanna Shoal. Up to 31 total PAHs, including parent and alkyl homologues were detected with total concentrations ranging from a low of 168 ng g(-1) the western flank of Hanna Shoal (station H34) to 1147 ng g(-1) at station in Barrow Canyon (station BarC5). Alkyl PAHs were more abundant than parent structures and accounted for 53-64\% of the summed concentrations suggesting overall at background levels (< 1600 ng g-1) in sediments. Alkane (C-15-C-33) hydrocarbons ranged from 4.3 mu g g(-1) on the southern flank of Hanna shoal to 31 g g(-1) at a northern station. Sediments were often dominated by short chain (C-15-C-22) alkanes with overall terrestrial aquatic ratios (TAR) for the region averaging 0.20. Based on the ratio of F1/(F1 + Py) and BaF/(Baf + BeP) verses (BA/BA + Ch) in sediments, PAHs are largely derived from petrogenic sources with minor amounts of mixed combustion sources. A diversity of PAHs were detected in the northern whelk Neparnea heros foot muscle with total concentrations ranging from 0.14 to 1.5 tig g-1 dry tissue wt. Larger (and presumably older) animals showed higher levels of PAH per unit muscle tissue, suggesting that animals may bioaccumulate PAHs over time, with low but increasing concentrations also present in internal and external eggs. Alkane hydrocarbons were also higher in whelks with distributions similar to that seen in sediments. The mussel Muscularus discors collected in Barrow Canyon showed constrained distributions and substantially lower concentrations of both PAHs and alkanes than the surrounding surface sediments.",0.044

This study aimed to understand the abundance, diversity, and activity of anammox bacteria and to determine the main factors influencing the anammox process in estuarine sediments in China. Materials and methods Estuarine sediments were collected from 18 estuaries spanning over 4000 km. Experiments using an (15)Ntracer, quantitative PCR, and clone library construction were used to determine the activity, abundance, and diversity of anammox bacteria. The impact of environmental factors on anammox processes was also determined. Results and discussion The abundance of the anammox-specific hydrazine synthase (hzsB) gene ranged from 1.8 x 105 +/- 3.4 x 104 to 3.6 x 108 +/- 7.5 x 107 copies g(-1) dw. Candidatus Scalindua, Brocadia, Kuenenia, Jettenia, and two novel unidentified clusters were detected, with Scalindua dominating the anammox population. Additionally, the abundances of Scalindua, Kuenenia, and Brocadia were found to be significantly correlated with latitude. The anammox rates ranged from 0.29 +/- 0.15 to 13.68 +/- 3.98 nmol N g(-1) dw h(-1) and contributed to 2.39-82.61\% of total N-2 production. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the anammox rate was positively correlated with total nitrogen, total carbon, and temperature, and was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (DO). The key factors influencing the hzsB gene abundance were ammonium concentration, salinity, and DO. Ammonium concentration, pH, temperature, and latitude were main variables shaping the anammox-associated bacterial community. Conclusions Our results suggested that anammox bacteria are ubiquitous in coastal estuaries in China and underline the importance of anammox resulting in N loss at a continental scale.",0.065

Urban forests provide myriad valuable ecosystem services essential for urban sustainability and resilience. These essential services are supported by natural soil microbial processes that transform organic matter to critical nutrients for plant community establishment and development. Nitrogen (N) is the most limiting nutrient in forest ecosystems, yet little information is known about N cycling in urban afforestation efforts. This study examined microbially mediated processes of carbon (C) and N cycling in 10 experimental afforested sites established across New York City parklands under the MillionTreesNYC initiative. Long-term research plots were established between 2009 and 2011 at each site with low and high diversity (two vs. six tree species) treatments. In 2018, 1-m soil cores were collected from plots at each site and analyzed for microbial biomass and respiration, potential net N mineralization, and nitrification, denitrification potential, soil inorganic N, and total soil N. Field observations revealed markedly different trajectories between sites that exhibited a closed canopy and leaf litter layer derived from trees that were planted and those that did not fit this description. These two metrics served to group sites into two categories (high vs. low) of afforestation success. We hypothesized that: (1) afforestation success would be correlated with rates of C and N cycling, (2) high diversity restoration techniques would affect these processes, and (3) inherent soil properties interact with plants and environmental conditions to affect the development of these processes over time. We found that high success sites had significantly higher rates of C and N cycling processes, but low and high diversity treatments showed no differences. Low success sites were more likely to have disturbed soil profiles with human-derived debris. Afforestation success appears to be driven by interactions between initial site conditions that facilitate plant community establishment and development that in turn enable N accumulation and cycling, creating positive feedbacks for success.",0.139

Pamela; Andres, Miriam S.","In tribute to Dr. Robert N. Ginsburg (1925-2017), we examine his 1991 seminal paper Controversies about Stromatolites: Vices and Virtues, which summarized current ideas about stromatolites including controversies of definition, whether ancient stromatolites should be interpreted as sedimentary structures and mechanisms of carbonate fixation. The accepted model of stromatolite morphogenesis in 1991 was that biology controls microscale internal structure whereas environment controls macroscale morphology. Ginsburg, however, predicted that biology and environmental influences on stromatolite growth were closely coupled at macro, meso and micro scales. Recent research in Hamelin Pool and the Bahamas has advanced our understanding of the inherent duality of stromatolites and associated controversies. These studies suggest that at the macroscale, when physical forces are strong, the environment is the main control on the morphology; however, when physical forces are weak, biological communities become the main drivers of morphology. Therefore, stromatolites can be considered both as fossils and as sedimentary structures dependent on the energy in the environment of deposition. At the mesoscale, as predicted by Trompette, stromatolite fabrics are influenced equally by environment and biology. As the degree of lamination is often unknown or heterogeneous, a generic genetic term such as `microbialite' is considered the most appropriate terminology for structures of probable microbial origin. At the microscale, stromatolite microfabrics reflect environmentally driven cycling of microbial communities, reflecting both biology and environment. With respect to carbonate fixation, research on modern stromatolites provides a model for biofilm precipitation of micritic laminae lacking microfossils in ancient stromatolites. As pointed out by Ginsburg, the inherent duality of environmental and biological controls of morphogenesis at all scales is at the root of many long-standing controversies. Recent investigations corroborate the foresight of Ginsburg nearly 30 years ago, further confirming well-preserved stromatolites can provide insight into both biology and environmental factors in ancient ecosystems.",0.062

Research efforts have become increasingly more collaborative, with increasing use of field instrumentation, data acquisition systems and remote sensing. Rich datasets are resulting in more comprehensive computational models. Human-altered systems are of increasing interest, but knowledge of these systems lags far behind knowledge of natural systems. Research is becoming more relevant to societal needs as the vulnerability of coastal populations increases.The need for investigation of understudied or unexplored environments, including human altered ones, is ongoing.

The annual mean wind speed (MWS), days of strong wind (SWDs), and maximum wind (MW) all show declining trends over broad areas of China. Only in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau and the regions from the Great Bend of the Yellow River southward to Yunnan and Guangxi Provinces wind speeds are not significantly reduced, but rather, in partial, these regions' winds speeds are slightly increased. The regions with declining trends match the areas with relatively strong observed winds and the regions without significant declining trends match the areas with light observed winds. In the meantime, the regions with relatively strong winds correspond to areas of reduced days of SWDs. Trends for both increasing intensities and for the number of days of light winds both impact the installation of wind energy facilities. These may be advantageous to the development of wind energy in different regions. Urbanization, the change of anemometers, or relocation of stations are factors that are mildly responsible for the decreasing trend of MWS. The main reason for the decreasing trend is that under the background of global warming, the contrasts of the sea level pressure, and near-surface temperature between the Asian continent and the Pacific Ocean have become significantly smaller, and the east Asian trough has shifted eastward and northward, and has weakened as well. Both East Asian winter and summer monsoons are decreasing, and all of these impacts have resulted in declines of MWS in China.",0.058

Yet, integrative thinking and action often remain problematic due to the competing interests and ambitions involved in coastal zone planning and management and the legacy of established development on the coast. This paper presents a developmental timeline to critically consider institutional responses to coastal development and seeks to locate contemporary challenges, such as climate change, in the context of a new environmental determinism. The argument is put forward that securing a shared understanding of development conditions and risks needs to be predicated on creating more robust conditions for interaction and fostering a sounder appreciation of the inter-dependencies of natural processes and governance. The concept of resilience is critically explored in order to consider a normative analytical framework for facilitating social learning and developing a reciprocal understanding of social-ecological dynamics that offers a spectrum of resilience options.

The typhoons are one of the threats to the coastal areas causing direct damages with increasing sea surface temperature and sea level rise due to global warming. The damages caused by waves and swells generated by anti-cyclonic winds from the recent typhoons prompted the Korean government to initiate two projects, development of coastal erosion control technology and investigation of large swell waves and rip currents for the southern and eastern coasts. During the typhoon Vongfong (2014), the highest wave recorded at Uljin (6 m) was 80 minutes after the highest wave at Samcheok (4.6 m), which is located further northwest.

The Ekman transport due to alongshore winds and Ekman pumping due to wind stress curl play important roles on the coastal upwelling, especially along the southern part of Indian peninsula. Upwelling Indexes based on wind and SST are computed in the study to demarcate the upwelling features along the coasts. Since upwelling leaves its trail on surface features, long time series of satellite-derived wind, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea level anomaly (SLA) and Surface Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) are analyzed to understand the upwelling along the coastal regions of south India. The present study reveals a decrease in the intensity of upwelling along the western coast (Chl-a similar to 0.2 mg/m(3) dec(-1), Upwelling Index based on wind () and Vertical Velocity of Ekman Pumping (VVEP) is approximately 0.0012 m(2)/s dec(-1) and 0.120 cm/day dec(-1) respectively) and a slight increase all along the eastern coast of southern India during summer monsoon (Chl-a along 11.3 degrees N and 13.9 degrees N is 1 mg/m(3) dec(-1), and VVEP along 10.5 degrees N is 0.0023 m(2)/s dec(-1) and 0.2 cm/day dec(-1) respectively).",0.365

In the atmosphere sulphate aerosols tend to increase haze, altering the global radiation balance. Increased nitrogen deposition to N-limited systems such as boreal forests results in increased growth and increased sequestration of atmospheric CO2, slowing the increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Future reduction in S and N emissions may result in a trade-off - better with respect to some effects of acid deposition and greenhouse warming, but worse with respect to others. Global warming may cause the incidence and severity of drought to increase. Mineralisation of N and oxidation of organic S compounds release pulses of SO4, acid and Al to surface waters. Effects in lakes may include reduced deep water refugia for cold stenotherms, lower nutrient concentrations, and greater penetration of harmful UV radiation. Longer water renewal times cause declines in SO4 and NO3, due to increased in situ removal, but increases in base cations. The net result is increased internal alkalinity production. In areas characterised by cold winters, global warming may result in a major shift in hydrologic cycle, with snowmelt episodes occurring during the winter rather than the typical pattern of accumulation in the winter and melting in the spring. Increased storm frequency predicted for the future will cause increased frequency and severity of sea salt episodes in coastal regions. Predicting the interactions of regional and global environmental factors in the coming decades poses new challenges to scientists, managers and policy-makers.",0.103

Stakeholders and authorities have acted by supporting and implementing gradually stricter fishing restrictions following the collapse in the 1970s of several demersal fish stocks and their apparent lack of recovery. Moreover, concerns have been raised regarding a locally sharp depletion of eelgrass meadows, in addition to an apparent increase in the number of seals and cormorants. The present 8-fjords initiative applies a cross-sector approach to environmental management and thus also addresses various types of environmental pollution. This study has compared the environmental work around the 8-fjords to 15 principles regarding the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF). The main strength that has been identified among the EAF principles is the continuous involvement of stakeholders. Among weaknesses in the EAF is the scarcity of suitable indicators that are necessary for appropriate monitoring, especially biomasses of functional groups as well as economic and social indicators. Many environmental problems in the fjords remain and it is possible that improved adherence to EAF principles will facilitate solving some problems and alleviating others. Moreover, the application of the EAF in practice in the 8-fjords can serve as a guiding example for co-managing other aquatic ecosystems towards ecological, economic, and social sustainability. The experiences from the 8-fjords initiative, including its extensive stakeholder involvement, may serve as a practical EAF example to be studied by researchers and managers globally.",0.587

In this study, almost 15 years of monthly beach/dune measurements were analyzed for three different pro?les at Vougot Beach, France to understand and predict shoreline changes from intra-annual to multi-annual time-scales. Four migration modes: advance/retreat (translation modes) and steepening/flattening (rotation modes) were identified through a centroid analysis. The analysis showed that translation and rotation can occur simultaneously, with long-term trends of beach retreat and profile steepening (lower beach retreating and upper beach advancing), which was interrupted by two energetic wave events causing profile flattening (lower beach advancing and upper beach retreating). These two observations are evidence of how the sediment contribution resulting from the dune erosion events temporarily caused a large advance in the shoreline position. A recent modeling approach that accounts for different time-scales is applied to predict the shoreline changes, showing signi?cant improvements in comparison to a traditional shoreline equilibrium model when time-scales related with the dune erosion and recovery are considered. The results showed that the dune system affects the beach pro?le evolution both spatially, with different impacts at different elevations along the cross-shore pro?le, and temporally, by periodically redistributing the sediment in the system.",0.032

In particular, new algorithms for identifying and locating navigation buoys and for the automatic detection of the shoreline (a proxy for the channel location) are presented and validated. In both cases (Teignmouth and Santander ports) the video system is proven to evaluate quantitative CSIs over a broad range of time-scales (hours to years) which cannot be obtained practically with traditional monitoring techniques. The techniques developed here deliver more information to port authorities; facilitating more informed management decisions regarding how, when, or where intervention is required and thus reducing the navigation risk to shipping.

They can effectively increase the dissolved oxygen content in the bottom water layer by their disturbing effect of upwelling and downwelling. The bottom water is prone to hypoxia in summer due to the extreme weather of the global climate and excessive biomass in some marine ranching in northern China. Therefore, how to effectively use the upwelling effect of artificial reefs to alleviate this problem is a necessary subject of research. Generally, ARs are arranged by different intervals in a unit form on the seafloor, and the flow field effect is different from that of the individual reefs. However, few studies have been focused on the effect of layout mode on the flow field of a unit reef (UR). In this paper, we selected the interval between reefs (IR) and the angle of inflow (AI) as the influencing factors to study the flow field effect of UR. The upwelling and wake regions of 64 URs were presented by the efficiency and disturbance indices related to the flow characteristics and proposed an optimal layout mode having the best performance of the upwelling effect. The results showed that the interactions among the AI, the transverse, and longitudinal IRs were significant, and the AI has a significant influence on the flow field. These indices were effective and contribute to the layout optimization of UR. The AI close to 45 degrees has a significant influence on the flow field effect of UR.",0.917

Although the distribution patterns of pelagic sediments are influenced by the Gulf of Tehuantepec bathymetrical morphology and the terrigenous input, these `'reflect'' clearly the regional oceanography. Northern strong winds, called the `'Tehuanos'', blowing across the sea surface of this Gulf when the Intertropical Convergence is at its southernmost position, define the main sedimentologic dynamics of this region. This wind field gives rise to an oceanic front at the southwestern part of the Gulf, as well as upwelling processes at its central-eastern part. In the mixing at the front there is some contribution of California Current waters, while in the upwelling area there is a large contribution of the tropical-subtropical water which is carried by the Costa Rica Coastal Current. This oceanographic framework controlls the makeup of radiolarian assemblages. Consequently, at the seabottom, under the oceanic front, the presence of the radiolarian species Lithomelissa thoracites and Cycladophora davisiana is observed, while under the upwelling region, Acrosphaera murrayana is conspicuous.",0.252

Adaptive capacity is key for moving fisheries onto climate resilient pathways, however, implementing policies to improve adaptive capacity is challenging given the many diverse stakeholders involved in fisheries. Previous research suggests social networks are integral to adaptive capacity because social connectivity can enable, or constrain, knowledge and information sharing. We examine the network of communication among stakeholders in the Basque tropical tuna freezer purse seine fishery in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. We use cluster analysis, descriptive statistics, and exponential random graph models to assess whether different types of actors, occupying different network positions, value similar adaptive capacity strategies. The results indicate that many actor types are frequently connected within the fishery. Preferences for adaptive capacity strategies vary within and across actor types, and the preferences of highly central actors are generally more homogeneous and narrowly focused. All actors agree on the importance of the social organization domain from adaptive capacity, while fishing industry representatives tend to have the most holistic perspective on adaptive capacity overall. We discuss the implications of these findings as they relate to policies for supporting adaptive capacity and climate resilient fisheries.",0.839

The Convention on Biological Diversity and other international and national policy agreements have set broad goals for reducing the rate of biodiversity loss. However, efforts to conserve biodiversity cannot be effective without comprehensive metrics both to assess progress towards meeting conservation goals and to account for measures that reduce pressures so that positive actions are encouraged. We developed an index based on a global assessment of the condition of marine biodiversity using publically available data to estimate the condition of species and habitats within 151 coastal countries. Our assessment also included data on social and ecological pressures on biodiversity as well as variables that indicate whether good governance is in place to reduce them. Thus, our index is a social as well as ecological measure of the current and likely future status of biodiversity. As part of our analyses, we set explicit reference points or targets that provide benchmarks for success and allow for comparative assessment of current conditions. Overall country-level scores ranged from 43 to 95 on a scale of 1 to 100, but countries that scored high for species did not necessarily score high for habitats. Although most current status scores were relatively high, likely future status scores for biodiversity were much lower in most countries due to negative trends for both species and habitats. We also found a strong positive relationship between the Human Development Index and resilience measures that could promote greater sustainability by reducing pressures. This relationship suggests that many developing countries lack effective governance, further jeopardizing their ability to maintain species and habitats in the future.",0.695

Although the two communities have archived significant progresses in their own fields since early 1990s, there were few interactions between the communities. Rapid advancements of operational oceanography on ocean monitoring, data sharing, modeling, and historical ocean state reconstruction in the last decade have provided a wide range of data, products and modeling tools which may be used in Earth system and climate change research.

This creates challenges for adaptation planning in exposed coastal communities. We present a framework to support the interpretation of current long-term tropical cyclone projections, which accommodates the nature of the uncertainty and aims to facilitate robust decision making using the information that is available today. The framework is populated with projections taken from the recent literature to develop a set of scenarios of long-term hurricane hazard. Hazard scenarios are then used to generate risk scenarios for Florida using a coupled climate-catastrophe modeling approach. The scenarios represent a broad range of plausible futures; from wind-related hurricane losses in Florida halving by the end of the century to more than a four-fold increase due to climate change alone. We suggest that it is not possible, based on current evidence, to meaningfully quantify the relative confidence of each scenario. The analyses also suggest that natural variability is likely to be the dominant driver of the level and volatility of wind-related risk over the coming decade; however, under the highest scenario, the superposition of this natural variability and anthropogenic climate change could mean notably increased levels of risk within the decade. Finally, we present a series of analyses to better understand the relative adequacy of the different models that underpin the scenarios and draw conclusions for the design of future climate science and modeling experiments to be most informative for adaptation.

Feeding is known to alter coral physiology and increase resilience to bleaching. The goal of the study was to address the knowledge gap of the influence of feeding on reproductive output and offspring phenotype. Colonies of Stylophora pistillata from the Northern Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea) were fed an Artemia diet or unfed for 5 months during gametogenesis, fertilization, and brooding. In addition, time to settlement and mortality of planulae were assessed at water temperatures ranging from winter temperature (22 degrees C) to three degrees above average peak summer temperature (31 degrees C). A range of physiological parameters was measured in parents and offspring. In brooding parents, feeding significantly increased protein concentration and more than tripled the number of released planulae. Planulae from unfed colonies had higher chlorophyll per symbiont concentration and concomitantly higher photosynthetic efficiency compared to planulae from fed parents. In settlement assays, planulae showed a similar thermal resistance as known for this Red Sea adult population. Mortality was greater in planulae from unfed parents at ambient and 3 degrees C above ambient temperature despite higher per offspring investment in terms of total fatty acid content. Fatty acid profiles and relative abundances were generally conserved between different fed and unfed colonies but planulae were enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids relative to adults, that is, 16:1, 18:1, 20:1, 22:1, and 24:1 isomers.

Removal of dominant species, therefore, can potentially lead to pronounced changes in diversity and community structure through a series of negative and positive interactions involving several components of the community. Here we test community responses to the deletion of the dominant, canopy-forming alga Hormosira banksii from the mid-intertidal zone of wave-protected rocky shores in southern New Zealand. This species was removed in winter (July) from three 3x3-m areas at each of two platforms (Kaikoura and Moeraki) on the east coast of the South Island. Initially, 59 taxa occurred in stands, but there were only four algal species with greater than 5\% cover and three mobile invertebrate species with more than five individuals per 0.25 m(2). By 6 months after Hormosira removal, most fucoid and coralline algae had burned off, and there were blooms of ephemeral algae in the removal plots, but almost no change within controls. After 2 years, diversity declined by 44\% relative to controls at Kaikoura and 36\% at Moeraki, and the amount of bare space had increased by tenfold at Kaikoura and twofold at Moeraki. Few sessile or mobile invertebrates were present. Recruitment of Hormosira occurred after 14 months in the removal plots. At this time, a ``press{''} disturbance was initiated into one half of each removal plot to test the effects of continued removal of Hormosira on diversity. Similar ``end-points{''} of the control and ``press{''} removal plots were not reached after 2 years, and even after Hormosira recruitment into the original ``pulse{'' experiment there was little recovery of the community. In this mid-intertidal system with considerable thermal stress, and perhaps in others with few perennial species, diversity and community structure can critically depend on positive associations with a single dominant species.",0.032

Many of these lakes, which cover approximately 20\% of the Pleistocene sand sea, are relatively deep (up to 25 m). In addition to the natural importance of ACP sand sea lakes for water storage, energy balance, and ecological habitat, the need for winter water for industrial development and exploration activities makes lakes in this region a valuable resource. However, ACP sand sea lakes have received little prior study. Here, we collect in situ bathymetric data to test 12 model variants for predicting sand sea lake depth based on analysis of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Lake depth gradients were measured at 17 lakes in midsummer 2017 using a Humminbird 798ci HD SI Combo automatic sonar system. The field-measured data points were compared to red-green-blue (RGB) bands of a Landsat-8 OLI image acquired on 8 August 2016 to select and calibrate the most accurate spectral-depth model for each study lake and map bathymetry. Exponential functions using a simple band ratio (with bands selected based on lake turbidity and bed substrate) yielded the most successful model variants. For each lake, the most accurate model explained 81.8\% of the variation in depth, on average. Modeled lake bathymetries were integrated with remotely sensed lake surface area to quantify lake water storage volumes, which ranged from 1.056 x 10(-3) to 57.416 x 10(-3) km(3). Due to variations in depth maxima, substrate, and turbidity between lakes, a regional model is currently infeasible, rendering necessary the acquisition of additional in situ data with which to develop a regional model solution.

Species carbon biomass-cell size spectra produced by log transformation of the relevant data yielded positive slopes for both taxonomic and ataxonomic groups. In contrast, comparisons of the relative cell abundance, cell volume and carbon biomass levels showed large differences among these variables across taxonomic and ataxonomic groups. This work demonstrates that phytoplankton taxonomic and ataxonomic functional group relationships should be considered when developing future models of phytoplankton community structure.",0.088

While the model setup combines a regionally high resolution with the benefits of a global ocean model, the large ensemble size of 32 members allows the estimation of high return levels with much lower uncertainty. We find that ESLs increase with atmospheric CO2 levels, even without considering a rise in the background sea level (BSL). Local increases of up to 0.5 m are found along the western shorelines of Germany and Denmark for ESLs of 20-50 years return periods, while higher return levels remain subject to sampling uncertainty. This ESL response is related to a cascade of an enhanced large-scale activity along the North Atlantic storm belt to a subsequent local increase in predominantly westerly wind speed extremes, while storms of the major West-Northwest track type gain importance. The response is seasonally opposite: summer ESLs and the strength of its drivers decrease in magnitude, contrasting the response of the higher winter ESLs, which governs the annual response. These results have important implications for coastal protection. ESLs do not only scale with the expected BSL rise, but become even more frequent, as preindustrial 50-year return levels could be expected to occur almost every year by the end of the century. The magnitude of the relative change in ESL statistics is hereby up to half of the expected rise in BSL, depending on the location. Changes in the highest extremes are subject to large multidecadal variations and remain uncertain, thus potentially demanding even further safety measures.",0.246

E.; Brindhadevi, Kathirvel; Pugazhendhi, Arivalagan","The major hurdles causing difficulties in mechanized transportation are the depletion of fossil fuels and the high cost of alternative plant-based substrates for producing biofuels. To solve these issues, biofuels were emerged as effective alternatives to reduce pollution caused by the emission of greenhouse gases. Among biofuels, biobutanol is gaining attention as a feasible, renewable, cost-effective, alternative fuel. But the usages of conventional agricultural crops as feedstock are sensitive and controversial due to the growing concern over the availability of food worldwide. Microalgae are an excellent resource to overcome these challenges, which grows on both the sea and freshwater. Microalgae reducing their land usage with agriculture, and there is no food and fuel conflict exist. In addition, microalgae utilize inorganic carbon from the atmosphere for growth; hence they can reduce the emission levels as well as produce clean energy. Therefore, microalgae as third-generation feedstock came into practice due to their fast growth rate and higher car-bohydrate content. The main focus of the present review is to discuss in detail about the major challenges faced as a feedstock, genetic engineering strategies adopted and future perspectives to improve the production of biobutanol from microalgae.",0.873

This study uses the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to investigate how indigenous communities living on two physically different islands in Torres Strait, Australia, experience what they consider to be the impacts of climate change in relation to their daily lives. During this process, a series of natural, physical, and socio-cultural limits and barriers to climate change adaptation were identified on Boigu, a low-lying mud island inundated by the sea during high tides and storm surges. As a volcanic island, Erub's elevation is higher but significant community infrastructure, housing, and cultural sites are located on the low coastal fringe. No immediate limits to climate change adaptation were identified on Erub, but physical and socio-cultural barriers were revealed. Limits to climate change adaptation occur when adaptation actions fail to protect the things valued by those affected, or few adaptation options are available. Barriers to climate change adaptation may be overcome if recognised and addressed but can become entrenched limits if they are ignored. Within the participating communities, such limits and barriers included (a) restricted adaptation options due to limited access to particular livelihood assets; (b) difficulty engaging with government processes to secure external support; and (c) people's place-based values, which evoke a reluctance to relocate or retreat.",0.936

National statistical data and process-based life cycle inventory (LCI) were used to build a zinc production LCI at the macro level. To confirm the credibility of this study, an uncertainty analysis was conducted via Monte-Carlo simulation. The impacts of climate change, human toxicity, marine ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, metal depletion, and fossil depletion categories on the overall environmental burden were examined. The overall environmental burden was dominated by key processes, such as zinc ore mining and energy (i.e., electricity and natural gas) consumption. In 2013, the amounts of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, zinc, and copper generated by hydrometallurgical zinc production were 2.60 x 10(7), 4.29 x 10(4), 6.77 x 10(4), 1.23 x 10(4),1.38 x 10(3), and 3.20 x 10(2) t. The first four substances accounted for 0.25\%, 0.21\%, 0.30\%, and 0.10\% of the overall national emission. Effective approaches to reduce the overall environmental impact of hydrometallurgical zinc production include improving the efficiencies of electricity, natural gas, and zinc ore consumption; substituting clean energy for coal-based electricity production; reducing the direct emission of zinc and copper; and increasing the national zinc recycle rate.

We monitored reproductive phenology of Mimusops andongensis and Mimusops kummel, and its relationship with climate, tree diameter and canopy position. We sampled trees in six diameter classes and noted their canopy position. For both species flowering began in the dry season through to the rainy season, but peaked in the dry season, whilst fruiting occurred in the rainy season and peaked during the most humid period. Flowering was positively correlated with temperature. Conversely, fruiting was negatively correlated with temperature and positively with rainfall, only in the Guineo-Sudanian zone. For M. andongensis, flowering and fruiting prevalences were positively linked to stem diameter, while only flowering was significantly related to canopy position. For M. kummel, the relationship with stem diameter was significant for flowering prevalence only and in the Guineo-Sudanian zone. Results suggest that phylogenetic membership is an important factor restricting Mimusops species phenology. Flowering and fruiting of both species are influenced by climate, and consequently climate change might shift their phenological patterns. Long-term investigations, considering flowering and fruiting abortion, will help to better understand the species phenology and perhaps predict demographic dynamics.",0.071

Urban resilience is understood as a process that involves enhancing capabilities for learning about changing conditions and for adapting to such conditions in order to reduce the risk of disasters, restore essential urban services and improve quality of life. In the past, landslides were the major cause of deaths from natural disasters in Santos, a large port city on the coast of Sao Paulo state, Brazil. The number of fatalities however fell significantly with the introduction of the Civil Defence Prevention Plan (PPDC) which has been in annual operation since 1989. The aim of this paper was to identify the landslide risk management tools employed by the Santos Civil Defence Department (responsible for disaster management), and to analyse the role of these tools in promoting urban resilience. Field, documentary and qualitative research (including literature reviews) revealed the Department's use of the following instruments: weather monitoring; a map to chart susceptibility to gravitational mass movements and floods; a Risk Reduction Plan; and a geotechnical map to illustrate aptitude for urbanization. The paper concludes that promotion of urban resilience by the Santos Civil Defence has been only partially achieved to date. The above-mentioned tools are still being implemented only gradually and challenges remain, such as the need to improve coordination between local government departments in favour of risk reduction.",0.295

In the present study, we evaluated the role of tropical monsoon pertaining to fluvial discharge, sediment load, coastal current and water stratification on seasonal organic carbon dynamics during four sampling campaigns in the Upper Gulf of Thailand (UGoT). This study demonstrates that particulate organic carbon (POC) is closely correlated with the river influx of suspended sediment, which is generally regulated by the local rainfall. Higher POC is found near the large estuarine section (Chao Phraya River, CHAO) during southwest monsoon period and the small estuarine section (Mae Klong River, MK) during November 2013 when tropical cyclones impacted. POC in the estuarine sections is more significantly influenced by the seasonal shift compared with the coastal sections. Land-derived organic matter prevails in the small estuarine and coastal sections, while marine-derived organic matter dominates in the estuarine sections impacted by CHAO and MK. Anthropogenic inputs and dam regulation also influences the river export of organic matter during the high precipitation periods. Total organic carbon (TOC) however displays less significant seasonal monsoon variations than POC. Further, TOC tends to accumulate in the sub-silt fraction of sediments, which mainly occurs in the small estuarine and eastern coastal sections and is more obviously influenced by marine-derived factors. TOC in sediment of the CHAO and MK influenced sections however displays more seasonal variations with prevailing river input evidenced by coarser sediment and higher C/N ratios. Moreover, the almost year round water stratification across the region acts as the barrier in retaining organic carbon in the estuaries and their vicinities from dispersal into the lower portion of Gulf of Thailand. High sedimentation rate (similar to 1.1 cm.yr(-1)) further facilitates the organic carbon burial in the study area. The delivery, dispersal and burial of organic carbon are closely associated with the climate-controlled precipitation, and thus the tropical monsoon climatology under the global warming in particular is an important factor influencing the organic carbon in the UGoT.",0.077

Monika","Fluctuations in weather and forest productivity influence the abundance and richness of bird populations, however in a rapidly urbanizing landscape the relative importance of each factor may vary. We assessed this possibility in the Seattle, WA, USA region by correlating 10 years of bird richness and relative abundance of nine guilds indicative of their tolerance of human development, migration, diet and use of human food subsidies with an annual index of forest productivity (vegetation greenness derived from a 250m resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product from the MODIS satellite) and weather (variation in the Oceanic Nino Index, which estimates the strength of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, a major driver of local temperature and precipitation). We found that variation in NDVI exerted a strong influence on the richness of the avian community and the abundance of guilds in landscapes undergoing active development, but was less influential in areas of established housing development or forested reserves. Relative to NDVI, weather was much less influential on the abundance of guilds at actively changing sites, and slightly more influential in forest reserves and established developments. Following the warm winter and during the dry summer associated with a strong El Nino, migrants and herbivores declined in changing landscapes, insectivores declined in established developments, and herbivores declined while synanthropic species increased in reserves. These changes may presage the effects of climate change in the Pacific Northwest, which are expected to be similar to El Nino conditions. To buffer these changes in native bird communities, planners, developers, regulators, and home owners shouldminimize the loss of vegetation during development and attempt to quickly achieve mature landscaping that preferably provides food and shelter for birds.",0.075

However, despite the years of discussion the correlation between adverse health effects and atmospheric pollution remains controversial, partly because these studies are frequently restricted to small and well-monitored areas. Monitoring air pollution is complex due to the large spatial and temporal variations of pollution phenomena, the high costs of recording instruments, and the low sampling density of a purely instrumental approach. Therefore, together with the traditional instrumental monitoring, bioindication techniques allow for the mapping of pollution effects over wide areas with a high sampling density. In this study, instrumental and biomonitoring techniques were integrated to support an epidemiological study that will be developed in an industrial area located in Gijon in the coastal of central Asturias, Spain. Three main objectives were proposed to (i) analyze temporal patterns of PM10 concentrations in order to apportion emissions sources, (ii) investigate spatial patterns of lichen conductivity to identify the impact of the studied industrial area in air quality, and (iii) establish relationships amongst lichen conductivity with some site-specific characteristics. Samples of the epiphytic lichen Parmelia sulcata were transplanted in a grid of 18 by 20 km with an industrial area in the center. Lichens were exposed for a 5-mo period starting in April 2010. After exposure, lichen samples were soaked in 18-MO water aimed at determination of water electrical conductivity and, consequently, lichen vitality and cell damage. A marked decreasing gradient of lichens conductivity relative to distance from the emitting sources was observed. Transplants from a sampling site proximal to the industrial area reached values 10-fold higher than levels far from it. This finding showed that lichens reacted physiologically in the polluted industrial area as evidenced by increased conductivity correlated to contamination level. The integration of temporal PM10 measurements and analysis of wind direction corroborated the importance of this industrialized region for air quality measurements and identified the relevance of traffic for the urban area.",0.037

The intensification of climate-connected impacts requires municipalities and communities to undertake adaptation measures and plans. These interventions should be capable of reducing negative climatic effects on human habitat and regional bioregions. On the one hand, the international scientific community recognized the supported adaptation planning approach as the more suitable to cope with local needs and criticalities. On the other hand, there is a lack of practical guidelines and examples that can be used to implement the theory. From a perspective of growth of global awareness and sensitivity to the climatic emergency, it is necessary to develop a practical methodology able to link together impacts perception and public decision process at the local scale. The paper aims to fill the gap between the theoretical approach and the practice, through a replicable experience of integration among climate change adaptation concepts and decision-making processes. The proposed methodology is described in a 4-step process to support decision-makers in selecting tailored adaptation policies and measures. The article is based on the experience developed within the Interreg It-Hr project ``iDEAL - Decision support for Adaptation pLan{''} project. The research combines a quantitative and qualitative methodology in local participation processes.

However, it consists of two genetically unrelated stratigraphical units: the lower part commonly comprises fine-grained bioclastic limestones that are poor in macrofossils and rest with a sharp basal surface on mid-upper Albian strata of the deep-marine Bazyab Formation: the microbiostratigraphy shows this part to be mid-late Albian in age (Pseudothalmanninella ticinensis Zone), thus constituting a lithostratigraphical equivalent of the lower Debarsu Formation. The upper part of the ``Glauconitic Limestone{''} consists of a fossiliferous glauconitic conglomerate with large rounded limestone pebbles to boulders and phosphatized bio-/lithoclasts, yielding the famous ammonite faunas of the unit. It has a major erosional unconformity at its base that may cut out the Debarsu Formation over short distances and it shows a fining-upward trend grading into an overlying marl and argillaceous limestone unit. These observations demonstrate that the glauconitic conglomerate initiated a new depositional cycle and is thus genetically related to the overlying fine-grained strata. Consequently, the glauconitic conglomerate is regarded as the basal TakhteSheitan Member (new) of the Kolah-Qazi Formation (new), formalized herein. The matrix of the upper part of the Takhte-Sheitan Member could be dated as mid-late Cenomanian (upper Rotalipora cushmani Zone) and the overlying fine-grained offshore deposits of the Kolah Qazi Formation as latest Cenomanian to early Turonian by means of foraminifera, ammonites, inoceramid bivalves and carbon stable isotopes. Thus, the late Albian to middle Cenomanian phosphatized ammonites from the Takhte-Sheitan Member are derived, i.e., represent classic remanie faunas. The Takhte-Sheitan Member is regarded as a complex, condensed transgressive lag onlapping a considerable palaeotopography after a late mid- to early late Cenomanian tectonic event. The overlying marl and argillaceous limestones of the Kolah-Qazi Formation indicate a considerable deepening in response to a major eustatic sea-level rise and highstand across the Cenomanian Turonian boundary associated by increased organic carbon burial related to the oceanic anoxic event (OAE) 2. The carbon stable isotope curve from the base of the Kolah-Qazi Formation (Takhte-Sheitan Member) up-section into the marls and argillaceous limestones shows the conspicuous structure of the major positive excursion of the OAE 2 and serves as precise tool for the high-resolution chemostratigraphic calibration of the Iranian sections.

Here, we estimated spatiotemporal changes in habitat suitability and inter-specific overlap among three marine predators: Baltic gray seals (Halichoerus grypus), harbor seals (Phoca vitulina), and harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) under contemporary and future conditions. Location data (>200 tagged individuals) were collected in the southwestern region of the Baltic Sea; one of the fastest-warming semi-enclosed seas in the world. We used the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm to estimate changes in total area size and overlap of species-specific habitat suitability between 1997-2020 and 2091-2100. Predictor variables included environmental and climate-sensitive oceanographic conditions in the area. Sea-level rise, sea surface temperature, and salinity data were taken from representative concentration pathways {[}RCPs] scenarios 6.0 and 8.5 to forecast potential climate change effects. Model output suggested that habitat suitability of Baltic gray seals will decline over space and time, driven by changes in sea surface salinity and a loss of currently available haulout sites following sea-level rise in the future. A similar, although weaker, effect was observed for harbor seals, while suitability of habitat for harbor porpoises was predicted to increase slightly over space and time. Inter-specific overlap in highly suitable habitats was also predicted to increase slightly under RCP scenario 6.0 when compared to contemporary conditions, but to disappear under RCP scenario 8.5. Our study suggests that marine predators in the southwestern Baltic Sea may respond differently to future climatic conditions, leading to divergent shifts in habitat suitability that are likely to decrease inter-specific overlap over time and space. We conclude that climate change can lead to a marked redistribution of area use by marine predators in the region, which may influence local food-web dynamics and ecosystem functioning.",0.069

The sediment core from nearshore mud area had distinctly higher delta Hg-202 and lower Delta Hg-199 values than those from offshore mud area, exhibiting an obvious difference in dominant Hg sources (land-based vs. atmospheric). An isotope mixing model on basis of Hg isotope signatures of these cores revealed that the contributions of Hg sources varied significantly not only among different sites but also among different periods. Rapid development of industrialization and urbanization since the 1980s have significantly increased Hg especially industrial Hg inputs into eastern China seas.

The analysis undertaken here supports studies of an improved impact of sea level rise by providing national-scale estimates of changes in wave overtopping rates and flood defence overflow rates, as a result of different amounts of sea level rise. The analysis involves the application of components of an existing risk-based coastal flood risk analysis method. A subset of almost 600 flood defence assets around the country has been analysed for sea level rise rates up to 1 m. The resulting analysis shows that, on average, the wave overtopping rate increases by up to 150 times above present-day rates for lower return periods and by up to five times for higher return periods. This differential arises as a result of non-linearities in overtopping rates with increasing extreme sea levels.",0.873

Our paper reviews sedimentological and structural data that enable us to determine a general chrono-tectono-stratigraphic framework for the syn-rift succession of the margin. The detailed study of the facies distribution within the different rift domains, including proximal, necking, hyper-extended, and exhumed mantle domains, allow us to identify syn- and post-tectonic sedimentary packages. The correlation of these sedimentary packages between the rift domains is based on the identification of basin-wide correlative stratigraphic intervals linked to global or basin-wide Jurassic events: (1) the Early Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event; (2) an Early Bajocian bio-siliceous event; and (3) the onset of Tithonian carbonate-dominated sedimentation. Using these timelines, we could recognize the oceanward propagation of the syn-tectonic package from the proximal to the exhumed mantle domains as a function of time. A key observation is that syn-tectonic packages can be compartmentalized into four tectonic system tracts across the margin. Each system tract and their associated bounding surfaces record the stratigraphic evolution and change in deformation mode related to distinct and successive syn-rift phases that correspond to the stretching (similar to 10My), necking (similar to 6My), hyper-extension (similar to 15My), and mantle exhumation (similar to 18My) phases.",0.042

These include direct interaction such as fisheries bycatch or indirect interaction like warming oceans and plastic ingestion. Area-based management tools (ABMTs), such as marine protected areas and time-area closures, are a widely accepted and a broadly successful form of management used to mitigate localized human impacts on marine species and ecosystems. Protection provides an opportunity for population recovery, which can then propagate outside of the closure. As the United Nations negotiates a new treaty on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction, efforts to design and implement high seas ABMTs at appropriate scales are critical to ensure that these spatial protection measures are most effective and climate-ready in the face of changing oceans. Here we identify the four most important temporal scales contemporary, intra-annual, multi-annual and multidecadal - for aligning high seas ABMTs to relevant ecological, oceanographic and atmospheric processes.

We assume that mixing of both heat perturbations and carbon into the deep ocean can be parameterized by effective diffusion. Comparison of two-dimensional model and coupled atmosphere-ocean GCM simulations justifies such an approach for projections 100-150 years ahead. Rates of vertical mixing fbr temperature perturbations and carbon are assumed to be positively correlated. We consider the uncertainty range of transient projections of climate change when the above correlation is taken into account.

Renewable energy and advanced technology have the potential to play an important role in providing clean energy. The Long-range Energy Alternative Planning (LEAP) model is used to analyze future electricity demand, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions reduction in the long term planning during 2010-2050. Regarding to those plans, implementations of renewable energy and advanced technology are proposed for mitigation options. The mitigation scenarios offer sustainable potential of renewable technologies and advanced technologies such as solar, wind, biomass, nuclear, hydropower, hydrogen fuel cell, tidal, geothermal and fossil-fuel power plants with carbon capture storage (CCS). Four mitigation scenarios are modeled along with the BAU scenario. The Mitigation 1 (MIT01) scenario is the base-case mitigation scenario based on the target of PDP2015, which target of renewable energy is 19,634 MW in 2036. In the Mitigation 2 (MIT02) scenario, the technologies in the MIT01 plus new technologies such as hydrogen fuel cell, tidal and geothermal are implemented.

Results show that, in the BAU scenario, electricity demand and CO2 emissions from the power sector will increase to 52,770 ktoe and 345,959 kt-CO2eq, respectively in 2050. By adopting mitigation options, total CO2 emissions in 2050 can be mitigated by 69.66\% in MIT04, following by 50.83\% in MIT02, 47.22\% in MIT03, and 41.71\% in MHIT01 when compared to the BAU scenario.

However, the longer duration required for evaluating potential chronic effects may increase endpoint variability and test costs compared to survival endpoints. In the present study we compare the performance and sensitivity to contaminants of 10-d sublethal sediment toxicity tests with the amphipod Melita plumulosa and harpacticoid copepod Nitocra spinipes. For both tests, sublethal effects were consistently observed when sediment contaminant concentrations exceeded sediment quality guideline (SQG) concentrations. The response of these bioassays in metal-contaminated sediments was shown to conform ideally with respect to the mean SQG quotient calculated on the basis of the Australian and New Zealand lower SQG trigger value, with toxicity being observed only in those sediments where the mean quotient exceeded one. Better predictions of nontoxicity were obtained when dilute acid-extractable rather than total metal concentrations were used. Using the upper SQG, toxicity frequently occurred at mean quotients below one. The effects were generally consistent with predictions from the acid-volatile sulfide and simultaneously extracted metal model. Effects on reproduction of M. plumulosa were detected for sediments that did not cause effects on survival and highlighted the environmental relevance and importance of using these sublethal endpoints. When using four replicates for M. plumulosa and five replicates for N. spinipes, the endpoint variability (standard error) was less than 10\%. Variations in sediment particle size and organic carbon content did not affect endpoint variability. Both species are relatively easily cultured in the laboratory, and the estimated effort and cost of achieving the sublethal endpoints is 1.5 times that of the acute survival test endpoints. Environ.

We characterized the distribution and concentration of nutrients at the Crookston Cattle Company feedlot (northwest Minnesota, USA), 15 years after it ended operations in 1999. Groundwater nitrate concentration decreased from 55 mg/L (as nitrogen) in 2003 to less than 5 mg/L since 2007. Results from stable isotope analysis, with delta N-15 and delta O-18 in groundwater nitrate ranging up to +44 and +30\%, respectively, suggest denitrification as the cause, rather than either nitrate transport from the site or dilution. Phosphorus, with soil B-horizon concentrations as much as 112 and averaging 24 mg/kg, is sequestered by carbonate-rich glacial sediments and, serendipitously, an iron-rich sand deposit formed millennia ago by wave action along the shore of glacial Lake Agassiz. Map analysis indicates roughly 20,000 kg of P in excess of background concentration remains in soil at the 15 ha site. Evidence suggests that the former feedlot has not affected water quality significantly in an agricultural ditch that drains the feedlot and its vicinity. Rather than originating from the feedlot, small increases of total phosphorus observed in the downstream ditch likely result from release of phosphorus from nearby recently restored wetlands. More consequential than elevated nutrient concentrations to the future reclamation of this and similar sites is the persistence of robust non-native species. Our results suggest that before development, feedlot sites should be evaluated for their phosphorus sequestration and denitrification potential, thus mitigating the potential for later off-site transport of nutrients.",0.079
91759801,https://sysrev.com/p/121334/article/91759801,The Gariep Belt,NA,"Frimmel, Hartwig Ernest","The Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian Gariep Belt in southwestern Namibia and westernmost South Africa, together with the Damara and Kaoko belts further north and the Saldania Belt to the south, forms an important part of the larger network of Pan-African/Brasiliano orogenic belts in SW-Gondwana. It is subdivided into two major tectonostratigraphic units: the external, continental, para-autochthonous Port Nolloth Zone in the east and the largely oceanic, internal Marmora Terrane in the west. Owing to its generally low metamorphic grade, the rocks exposed in the Gariep Belt provide an excellent record of Neoproterozoic Earth history from continental break-up, multiple glaciations, opening of a narrow oceanic basin, to continental collision in the course of Gondwana assembly. Crustal thinning of the pre-existing, Late Mesoproterozoic supercontinent Rodinia prior to continental rifting led to repeated alkaline, predominantly acid, magmatism at shallow crustal levels, starting at 837 +/- 2 Ma, widespread emplacement of a doleritic dyke swarm, which most likely served as feeders to a flood basalt province, and eventually bimodal, predominantly felsic, volcanic rocks along the principal growth fault at around 750 Ma. The continental, <= 771 +/- 6 Ma rift deposits reflect alluvial plain and delta environments that evolved into a shallow sea. The prevailing glacial conditions at around 750 Ma are indicated by an older diamictite (Kaigas Formation), which is overlain by first regionally persistent carbonate deposits in the succession. Following a major hiatus of at least 100 million years, a new major sequence sets in, first with predominantly coarse-grained, largely immature siliciclastic sedimentary rocks, including dolomitic megabreccias above a major unconformity, and shallow marine stromatolitic reef mounds. These units grade into a second, regionally extensive sheet of glaciogenic diamictite with minor intercalated banded iron formation. At that stage the westernmost graben became reactivated into a probably narrow basin floored by oceanic crust (now partly preserved in the Marmora Terrane with equivalents in the Cuchilla Dionisio Terrane in Uruguay) and locally with oceanic islands that developed into guyots. The timing of oceanic magmatism is estimated at 610 Ma. So far, no evidence of the global c. 635 Ma Marinoan glaciation has been detected in the Gariep Belt and it is speculated that the area was land at that time. The formation of oceanic crust in the Marmora Terrane is explained by the reactivation of a previous rift-graben as back-arc basin behind the large 640-590 Ma Cuchilla Dionisio-Pelotas magmatic arc in the Dom Feliciano Belt in southeastern Brazil and Uruguay. Climatic recovery after the Numees glaciation coincided with the closure of the Marmora back-arc basin and was followed by flyschoid foredeep deposits on top and in front of the advancing thrust sheets of the Marmora Terrane prior to continental collision between 550 and 545 Ma. Contractional deformation was largely transpressive, directed towards the southeast, with a strong sinistral wrench component along its eastern margin, and led to a fold-thrust belt with a steep orogenic front against a basement ramp in the east and southeast. Eventual exhumation and erosion fed detritus into the Nama foreland basin. Post-orogenic alkaline magmatism affected the southern part of the belt and the adjoining basement at 507 +/- 6 Ma.",0.030

In the last few decades, there was a significant change in the gaseous composition of earth's atmosphere, mainly through increased energy use in industry and agriculture sectors, viz. deforestation, intensive cultivation, land use change, management practices, etc. These activities lead to increase the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), etc., popularly known as the ``greenhouse gases{''} (GHGs), and rise up the temperature. These GHGs cause regional and global changes in the climate-related parameters such as rainfall, soil moisture, and sea level. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected temperature rise from 0.5 to 1.2 degrees C by 2020, 0.88 to 3.16 degrees C by 2050, and 1.56-5.44 degrees C by 2080 for India. To mitigate this climate change, among the different means, soil is also one of the key components of the agricultural production system, and it needs to be relooked in the view of the environment. Soil not only acts as a sink for GHGs but also as a source from agriculture. In this regard, concerted efforts are necessary for adverse climate change impact to reduce the vulnerability of agriculture. To meet out these issues, sources and mitigation options for individual gases from the soil are discussed in this chapter. Sources of CH4 emission are due to microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) under the submerged condition, burning of crop residue, and the enteric fermentation. The N2O is through fertilizers by the process of nitrification and denitrification. The major carbon (C) sources are tillage, burning of crop residue, and fossil fuel combustion. To overcome the emission of GHGs from the soil, the nature of the release of individual gas and its specific management can give an idea of sustaining soil health to safeguard the environment. Hence, reducing these GHGs emission from the soil through light to overcome the climate change effect. Reduction of CH4 gas mainly from rice can be done by the adoption of intermittent irrigation, planting methods, fertilizer type, etc. Nitrification inhibitors from plant-derived organics such as neem oil, neem cake, and Karanja seed extract could also reduce the N2O emission. Also, the demand-driven nitrogen (N) application using a leaf colour chart (LCC) reduces N2O emission. By using legume crops in rotation helps to reduce the N2O emission besides fixing long time C in the belowground. To reduce CO2 emission from the agriculture, sequestering C through agroforestry system, conservation agriculture, perennial crops, etc. could be the effective strategies for assimilating and storing C for a long time in soil.",0.242

Although iron is the fourth most abundant element in Earth's crust, there are few works in the literature that describe the use of iron oxide-hydroxide in prebiotic chemistry experiments. In the present work, the interaction of adenine, thymine, and uracil with ferrihydrite was studied under conditions that resemble those of prebiotic Earth. At acidic pH, anions in artificial seawater decreased the pH at the point of zero charge (pHpzc) of ferrihydrite; and at basic pH, cations increased the pHpzc. The adsorption of nucleic acid bases onto ferrihydrite followed the order adenine>> uracil>thymine. Adenine adsorption peaked at neutral pH; however, for thymine and uracil, adsorption increased with increasing pH. Electrostatic interactions did not appear to play an important role on the adsorption of nucleic acid bases onto ferrihydrite. Adenine adsorption onto ferrihydrite was higher in distilled water compared to artificial seawater. After ferrihydrite was mixed with artificial seawaters or nucleic acid bases, X-ray diffractograms and Fourier transform infrared spectra did not show any change. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy showed that the interaction of adenine with ferrihydrite was not pH-dependent. In contrast, the interactions of thymine and uracil with ferrihydrite were pH-dependent such that, at basic pH, thymine and uracil lay flat on the surface of ferrihydrite, and at acidic pH, thymine and uracil were perpendicular to the surface. Ferrihydrite adsorbed much more adenine than thymine; thus adenine would have been better protected against degradation by hydrolysis or UV radiation on prebiotic Earth.

Groundwater flow and saltwater/freshwater 50\% sharp interface have been modeled along the coastal area using the Ghyben-Herzberg theory. The groundwater flow simulations have been supported by field transmissivity estimations and depth measurements carried out on 44 wells during 2003. Results have shown the seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers at Jieh and Damour regions. Three well-injection barriers have been proposed. The water volumes for recharge and the barrier positions have been defined by means of groundwater flow simulations. MAR can provide a valuable contribution to colloid (even pathogen) removal from injectant water, although during water infiltration in subsoil the reduction of aquifer permeability causes clogging. A simple new model for estimating the soil-rock permeability reduction due to the well clogging has been presented. The MAR, including the soil aquifer treatment at Damour and Jieh regions, has been studied by considering aquifer transmissivity (and soil porosity) reduction caused by clogging. Furthermore, the appropriate mixing of the injectant water by using reclaimed water, groundwater and surface water can be simulated using the proposed models. The time required to achieve 5\% of rock permeability reduction at the proposed well barriers ranged from 71 to 935 d, by changing water quality and flow rate for recharge.

Most resilience studies assume that resilience-building is the central objective of sustainability work. Even though transformation has become a central theme in development and social-ecological debates, questions surrounding the weakening resilience of undesired system states are rarely analyzed. We suggest that resilience studies not only serve to protect systems and feedbacks we want to maintain, but may also help to understand and overcome chronic, undesirable, -and thus wicked-resilience. This contribution focuses on reef fisheries in the Spermonde Island Archipelago in Indonesia, based on social and ecological studies between 2004 and 2016. We identify a number of interlocking wickedly resilient vicious cycles as predominant drivers of the impoverishment of fishing households and the overexploited, polluted and degraded state of the coral reefs that fishers' livelihoods depend on. We argue that, more often than not in the Anthropocene, breaking resilience has a central role in the pursuit of sustainable human-nature relations. Therefore, the link between the resilience and the transformation debates needs to be much more explicitly made. Breaking interlocking, wicked resilience at multiple levels is needed to move toward sustainable human-nature relations from the local to the global level. There are lacunae in debate, literature, and research practice as to when, where and how wicked resilience might need to be weakened. A more complete resilience lens is particularly needed under Anthropocene conditions to support the unmaking of chronically resilient, anthropogenic systems.",0.482

Changing climate threatens the structure and function of saltmarshes, which are often severely degraded by other human perturbations. Along the Mediterranean coastline, increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall have been hypothesised to trigger habitat shifts from perennial grasses to annual succulents in fragile saltmarsh ecosystems, such as those fringing the North Adriatic coastline. 2. We used manipulative field experiments to investigate the effects of increased temperature, decreased precipitation and increased inundation period associated with rising sea levels on the dominant species in the lower marsh, the perennial grass Spartina spp. and the annual succulent Salicornia veneta. 3. At ambient inundation, the combined effects of increased temperature and decreased precipitation enhanced soil temperature and decreased soil moisture, resulting in an increased number of plants, height and live biomass of S. veneta, as well as greater dead biomass of Spartina spp. compared with current conditions. Increased inundation reduced the soil redox potential, and resulted in losses of both Spartina spp. and S. veneta, but these negative effects were much more pronounced for S. veneta. An inundation tolerance test confirmed that S. veneta is significantly more vulnerable to rapid increases in inundation than Spartina spp. 4. We conclude that at current inundation, the increasing drought conditions in the North Adriatic Sea are favouring the spread of the annual succulent S. veneta. The increasing spread of these succulents could reduce the future capability of the system to respond to projected increasing sea levels, as S. veneta is highly vulnerable to increased inundation. 5. Synthesis. Our results highlight the complex interactions between different components of changing climate. Management strategies for saltmarshes in the Mediterranean and other microtidal locations facing similar changes in climate should focus on maintaining the freshwater and coastal channels free from blockages to ameliorate the effects of episodic drought/heatwave conditions and increasing the sediment supply and preventing coastal squeeze to enhance the resilience of the system to the continuous threat of sea level rise.",0.069

A blank area is present along the reed field, which enables energy transformation during wave propagation. Three different regular waves have been sent to a natural reed field, and wave heights and kinematics have been measured around the structure. The results indicate that crest-parallel energy transmission takes place as the waves propagate along the reed field, which is boosted at the end of the reed, and the transmission becomes faster on waves with higher wave steepness. Measured water particle velocities have been evaluated to obtain the steady-cyclic and fluctuation components, by which, turbulence intensities in front and at the wake of the reed field have been evaluated.

The CT strategy was to shift the primary tillage event for the potato phase from the autumn to spring, and to reduce the degree and depth of tillage. Mulches were used on all plots after potato harvest to provide soil cover over the cool season. Potato yield, soil cover, soil organic matter and structure, and soil-borne diseases were used as indicators to assess the feasibility of the cropping systems. Marketable potato yield was similar between the two tillage systems. The CT system provided relatively high surface residue levels after potato planting, compared to the bare soil surface in the conventional tillage system. Soil organic carbon and soil structural stability were significantly increased at the 0-10 cm soil depth in the CT, compared to the conventional system.

Within this framework, this paper will emphasize three themes. Firstly, the dependence of the Portuguese empire on shipping efficiency; while the debate largely focuses on shipbuilding and seafarers, we show how crown policies and individual enterprises adapted to the evolving requirements of an empire based on sea power. Secondly, we demonstrate how informal and self-organized mechanisms at times contributed to, and sometimes blocked, state-oriented policies.

Historical data of groundwater salinity are mapped and compared with the current water samples to better understand the salinity spatial variability. The salinity maps show that salinization has increased sustainably. Additionally, the transition/dynamic zone related to SLR and/or excessive pumping can be addressed. In particular, the surface DC resistivity soundings were carried out to demonstrate the vertical and horizontal salinity distributions in the area. In the course of this study, the 1D model generation using a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) was applied and tested using borehole information. The constructed geoeletrical cross-sections emphasize and delineate the extension of saltwater intrusion. Cleary, it is found that due to excessive pumping from shallow wells over the last decades, the subsurface resistivity and TDS vertical distributions can change rapidly within a short distance. Additionally, the results show that despite the dominance of brackish and saltwater at the northern part of the area, perched low conductive lenses are observed reflecting a low level of groundwater salinization. To obtain a link between water salinity and aquifer resistivity, an empirical relationship was derived to predict the salinity variations at different depths. In comparison with the measured total dissolved solids (TDS), the predicted salinity map appears realistic. These results demonstrate the important role of the integration between resistivity and salinity measurements for mapping the groundwater salinization with depth, and call for further research to plan and manage the area's water resources.",0.052

Adaptation is fundamentally a local issue - flooding, coastal erosion, agricultural patterns, employment, regeneration and land use all impact the local level. It is now recognised that local governments have an important role in grappling with the complex impacts of climate change and setting in motion plans for their services and communities. Councillors (elected members) play a key role in championing adaptation at the local level. Their ongoing enthusiasm in driving forward the green agenda, their awareness of the risks of business as usual and their passion for community wellbeing puts them in the best position to develop public awareness of, and the political will, for taking action on adaptation. This paper identifies councillors' leadership role in the adaptation agenda. It presents a checklist with five suggested actions for councillors. On communicating the adaptation agenda to the public, councillors could use more simple language, give practical examples and use more innovative channels of communications.

The coral atoll of Kiritimati, Republic of Kiribati (1.9 degrees N, 157.4 degrees W), in the central tropical Pacific Ocean, contains hundreds of shallow water brackish to hypersaline lakes that contain a range of carbonate and evaporite minerals. Previous studies of Kiritimati lakes have investigated the microbial communities of finely laminated microbial mats and associated microbialites found in several of the more hypersaline lakes on the island. However, the microbial communities of the more brackish lakes are unknown. These brackish lakes precipitate metres of fine-grained carbonate muds, which are useful for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Here, the relationships between carbonate abundance, mineralogy, water chemistry, and bacterial and archaeal communities are investigated in a suite of brackish to hypersaline lakes (8.7-190 ppt) on Kiritimati. Next generation 16S rRNA gene sequencing of bacteria and archaea indicate that brackish lake sediments contain distinct microbial communities. In relation to carbonate precipitation, the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria, Choloroflexi and Deltaproteobacteria is greater in the brackish lake sediments, suggesting photosynthesis and sulphate reduction associated with these taxa may strongly influence alkalinity and carbonate precipitation in brackish lakes. The presence of dolomite in certain hypersaline lakes also coincided with the presence of a methanogenic family, indicating that methogenesis may contribute to dolomite precipitation in these lakes.",0.061

An examination of how a current system of marine protected areas, our National Marine Sanctuaries, functions, reveals that these sites may not function effectively to protect marine ecosystems.

A. (Tony); Bone, Christopher","Forest management practices can increase climate change mitigation potential through applications focused on carbon budgets. One such application involves utilizing non-merchantable material (i.e., logging residues typically piled and burned) for bio-energy. However, limited remote sensing data is available for estimating wood residues until after timber has been harvested, at which point recovery of residual wood is of little financial interest. This research utilizes a hybrid method to develop models that provide pre-harvest estimates of the amount of merchantable and non-merchantable material that would result from harvesting and investigates the scalability and transferability of such measures to the harvest block level. Models were trained using 38 plots across two sites dominated by Douglas-fir, then expanded to ten harvest blocks, and transferred to eight blocks from two sites without training data before being compared against multiple independent block-level estimates. Model results showed root mean square errors of 35\% and 38\% for merchantable and non-merchantable volumes, respectively. Merchantable volume estimates in blocks with training had average absolute differences from the harvest scale (9-34\%) similar to transferred blocks without training (15-20\%). Non-merchantable model results were also similar in both trained and transferred harvest blocks, with the pre-harvest model results having lower differences from the post-harvest geospatial versus field surveys. The results from this study show promise for hybrid methods to improve estimates of merchantable wood volume compared to conventional forest cover data approaches, and provide the ability to predict non-merchantable volumes within the range of accuracy of post-harvest residue survey methods.",0.178

Adaptive capacity (AC) is crucial to reduce heat vulnerability in the human-environment system. However, it is unclear whether changes in individual characteristics and socioeconomic conditions likely amplify or attenuate the impacts of residents' heat adaptive capacity (HAC) changes. Moreover, which public policies can be implemented by the authorities to improve the HAC of vulnerable groups remains unknown. We conducted a questionnaire survey of 630 residents of Xiamen, a typical coastal metropolis, in 2018. The effects of individual and household characteristics, and government actions on the residents' HAC were examined by using ordinal logistic regression analysis. Results show that the majority (48.10\%) of Xiamen residents had a ``medium{''} HAC level, followed by a ``high{''} level (37.14\%). On Xiamen Island, residents who settled locally for one-three years and spent less than one hour outdoors might report weaker HAC, and their HAC would not improve with increased air conditioning units in household. In other areas of Xiamen, residents with more rooms in their households, no educational experience, and building areas <50 m(2) might report better HAC. Further, vulnerable groups, such as local residents and outdoor workers on Xiamen Island, people lacking educational experience and renters in other areas of Xiamen, showed better AC to hot weather than those in previous studies. Low-income groups should be given more attention by local governments and community groups as monthly household income played a positive role in improving Xiamen residents' HAC. Rational green spaces planning and cooling services, such as street sprinkling operations, provided by municipal departments can effectively bring benefits to Xiamen residents. Identification of basic conditions of AC has significant implications for practical promoting targeted measures or policies to reduce health damages and livelihood losses of urban residents during extreme heat events.",0.300

The village of Cavo almost completely lost its beach in the 1970s due to the reduction of sedimentary input, and the backing coastal road was defended by a revetment and two detached breakwaters. Such severe erosion processes continued in the following years and impeded any possibility of beach tourist development. In 1999, a project based on the removal of existing breakwaters and beach nourishment works based on the use of gravel as borrow sediment and the construction of two short groins to maintain nourished sediment, raised environmental concern and did not find the approval of the stakeholders. They were worried about the characteristics of the sediments, i.e., waste materials from iron mining rich in red silt and clay. Such sediment fractions made the sea red during the nourishment and deposited on the Posidonia oceanica meadow in front of the beach, with a potential environmental impact. Furthermore, they cemented the gravel fraction forming a beach rock. Between 2006 and 2008, these materials were covered with better quality gravel, extending and raising the beach profile, which required the elevation and lengthening of the two existing groins. Beach evolution monitoring following the second project, based on morphological and sedimentological data acquired before, during and after the works, demonstrated the great stability of the newly created beach. The wider beach has allowed the construction of a promenade and the positioning, in summer, of small structures useful for seaside tourism, increasing the appeal of this village. Data presented in this paper shows an interesting study case, since few examples exist in international literature regarding gravel nourishment projects monitoring and evolution.</p>",0.642

These sediments derive entirely from surrounding coral reef and reef flat environments and are thus highly sensitive to ecological transitions that may modify reef community composition and productivity. How such modifications - driven by anthropogenic disturbances and on-going and projected climatic and environmental change - will impact reef island sediment supply and geomorphic stability remains a critical but poorly resolved question. Here, we review the unique ecological-geomorphological linkages that underpin this question and, using different scenarios of environmental change for which reef sediment production responses can be projected, explore the likely resilience of different island types. In general, sand-dominated islands are likely to be less resilient than those dominated by rubble grade material. However, because different islands typically have different dominant sediment constituents (usually either coral, benthic foraminifera or Halimeda) and because these respond differently to individual ecological disturbances, island resilience is likely to be highly variable. Islands composed of coral sands are likely to undergo major morphological change under most near-future ecological change scenarios, while those dominated by Halimeda may be more resilient. Islands composed predominantly of benthic foraminifera (a common state through the Pacific region) are likely to exhibit varying degrees of resilience depending upon the precise combination of ecological disturbances faced. The study demonstrates the critical need for further research bridging the ecological-geomorphological divide to understand: (1) sediment production responses to different ecological and environmental change scenarios; and (2) dependant landform vulnerability.",0.333

Model results are compared against independent moored and ship survey data to document a positive effect of velocity data assimilation (DA) on other oceanic variables of interest such as the sea surface height (SSH), temperature, potential density, surface salinity, and near-bottom turbulence parameters. Significant improvement is achieved for the nearshore SSH even when data are assimilated from only two moorings at an alongshore distance of 50 km from the SSH verification site. At 45 degrees N, in an area of simple shelf bathymetry with relatively small alongshore variations, the model ( even without DA) provides a good description of the isopycnal structure on a cross-shore section. At 44.2 degrees N, over complicated bathymetry, velocity DA may improve the slope of isopycnals but at the same time not necessarily the density values themselves. Data assimilation based on a time-invariant representation of the forecast error covariance may inhibit spatial variability on horizontal scales smaller than the assumed forecast error decorrelation scale. An experiment involving assimilation of both velocity and moored salinity measurements demonstrates that moored velocity DA improves transport of buoyant surface water. The level of improvement in the near-bottom turbulent dissipation and bottom stress found with the DA model indicates that it is suitable for future studies of spatial and temporal variability in the bottom boundary layer off Oregon.",0.025

Unquestionably, Greece is a characteristic example of this, as water distribution is highly spatially and temporally unequally distributed, while irrigation and tourist consumers as well as the pollution load are expected to be increased in the near future. Water resources in Greece are particularly affected by climate extremes, with droughts, floods and soil erosion by water being the utmost consequences. Greece consumes the greatest amount of its available water resources in the agricultural sector. Also, there is much evidence of water shortage and bad/poor chemical status of some water bodies, mainly due to saltwater intrusion in coastal agricultural areas and intensively agricultural activities. Therefore, this review provides a literature update on the quantity and quality aspects of water resources in Greece for each water body, focusing on water relation effects (aridity/drought, floods and soil erosion by water). This paper, based on different sources of information and an extensive database of water related data, collects, evaluates and groups data from a quantity and quality point of view for all the different water bodies of Greece. Specific water districts such as the Aegean islands, the eastern part of Crete, Attica and Thessaly are expected to be the most affected by climate-water impacts with reduced crops yields, a greater risk of droughts and/or floods, a loss of agricultural land, declining water availability, and degraded water resources (surface and groundwater). Based on these findings, the proposed review highlights agricultural adaptation practices for increasing water use efficiency, ensuring the sustainability of water resources in Greece.

Barter Island, Alaska, is one of the few locations where an extensive, observational dataset exists, which enables a detailed assessment of the trends and patterns of coastal change over decadal to annual time scales. Coastal bluff and shoreline positions were delineated from maps, aerial photographs, and satellite imagery acquired between 1947 and 2020, and at a nearly annual rate since 2004. Rates and patterns of shoreline and bluff change varied widely over the observational period. Shorelines showed a consistent trend of southerly erosion and westerly extension of the western termini of Barter Island and Bernard Spit, which has accelerated since at least 2000. The 3.2 km long stretch of ocean-exposed coastal permafrost bluffs retreated on average 114 m and at a maximum of 163 m at an average long-term rate (70 year) of 1.6 \& PLUSMN; 0.1 m/yr. The long-term retreat rate was punctuated by individual years with retreat rates up to four times higher (6.6 \& PLUSMN; 1.9 m/yr; 2012-2013) and both long-term (multidecadal) and short-term (annual to semiannual) rates showed a steady increase in retreat rates through time, with consistently high rates since 2015. A best-fit polynomial trend indicated acceleration in retreat rates that was independent of the large spatial and temporal variations observed on an annual basis. Rates and patterns of bluff retreat were correlated to incident wave energy and air and water temperatures. Wave energy was found to be the dominant driver of bluff retreat, followed by sea surface temperatures and warming air temperatures that are considered proxies for evaluating thermo-erosion and denudation. Normalized anomalies of cumulative wave energy, duration of open water, and air and sea temperature showed at least three distinct phases since 1979: a negative phase prior to 1987, a mixed phase between 1987 and the early to late 2000s, followed by a positive phase extending to 2020. The duration of the open-water season has tripled since 1979, increasing from approximately 40 to 140 days. Acceleration in retreat rates at Barter Island may be related to increases in both thermodenudation, associated with increasing air temperature, and the number of niche-forming and block-collapsing episodes associated with higher air and water temperature, more frequent storms, and longer ice-free conditions in the Beaufort Sea.",0.154

However, there are still no efficient drugs to cure the disease. Pycnogenol (PYC) isolated from the procyanidin-rich French maritime pine (Pinus maritime) bark has shown various antioxidant activities in previous studies. In this study, we explored its effect against rotenone (Rot)-induced neurotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms in PC12 cells. Using Rot-induced cell model of PD, we found that PYC treatment significantly increased cell viability and decreased cell apoptosis in Rot-treated PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, data showed that PYC markedly reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-nitric oxide (NO) signaling in Rot-treated PC12 cells. Pretreatment with the iNOS-specific inhibitor significantly attenuated Rot-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, PYC was found to be capable of reducing Rot-induced NF-B activation. Blocking NF-B signaling with its inhibitor mimicked the biological effect of PYC on Rot-induced iNOS and NO expression levels, as well as neurotoxicity in PC12 cells, suggesting that the NF-B-iNOS signaling pathway was likely to participate in the PYC-mediated protective progress. Our results suggest that PYC protects against Rot-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells, and the mechanism may be associated with the downregulation of NF-B-iNOS signaling pathway.",0.161

To do so, representative wind conditions (direction and speed) were used to force a validated lagoon wave model utilizing the process-based modeling suite Delft3D. The potential longshore sediment transport was computed along widely distributed cross-sections, based on representative wave cases, and the annual sediment budget was estimated. The results showed a pattern of inter-related source and storage areas along the bay beaches and the occurrence of short-term nodal zones (convergent and divergent), which have an important control on the regional sediment budget of the coast. The central littoral cells of the embayments behave as temporary sediment storage areas, while the southern littoral cells act as sources of sediments to the spits.

Parameters related to the seawater carbonate system and F-CO2 were measured monthly in 3 different aquaculture areas (fish, oyster and seaweed) and in a non-culture area near the bay mouth. The results showed that the seawater carbonate system was markedly influenced by the biological processes of the culture species. Total alkalinity was significantly lower in the oyster area compared with the fish and seaweed areas, mainly because of the calcification process of oysters. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) were highest in the fish area, followed by the oyster and non-culture areas, and lowest in the seaweed area. Oysters and fish can have indirect influences on DIC and pCO(2) by releasing nutrients, which facilitate the growth of seaweed and phytoplankton and therefore promote photosynthetic CO2 fixation. For these reasons, Shen'ao Bay acts as a potential CO2 sink in spring, with an average F-CO2 ranging from -1.2 to -4.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1). CO2 fixation in the seaweed area was the largest contributor to CO2 flux, accounting for ca. 58\% of the total CO2 sink capacity of the entire bay.

However, so far a systematic application to climate policy (CP) does not exist. One important postulation of PT is that outcomes are perceived as gains or losses, relative to the reference point. When it comes to CP, different decision-makers may have different reference points. For example, one decision-maker perceives the current climate as the reference point whereas another decision-maker may have another one, say climate in 100years. For the former, climate damages are losses and the benefits of CP are reductions of losses. For the latter, benefits of CP are gains. PT suggests that the former places a higher value in CP than the latter. After a critical review whether and how PT may be applied to CP, the paper systematically presents this and other cases where PT offers new insights into climate-related analyses, notwithstanding the importance of well-known aspects such as discounting, altruism, political and economic costs. It is shown that accounting for PT may contribute to a better understanding of some well-known puzzles in the climate debate, including different preferences for CP amongst individuals and nations, the role of technical vs. financial adaptation, and the apparent preference for hard protection measures in coastal adaptation.

The study has identified the key adaptations like dependency of money lenders, fishing and crab collection, formation of Self Help Groups, livestock rearing and migration. This paper has important policy implications for poverty, livelihood vulnerability and migration.",0.938

Regular evaluation of mechanisms, parameters and boundary conditions is required to understand groundwater flow and to develop a robust conceptual model. In certain conditions, as in tropical regions, due to the high intensity and variability of natural drivers (precipitation, evapotranspiration), a comprehensive hydrogeological characterization may be needed. Data on transient recharge, tide-driven fluctuations of groundwater receptors (seas, rivers) and the activation status of drainage networks may need to be updated recurrently, as they likely influence groundwater balance. Numerical models are applied at various phases of a hydrogeological investigation to elucidate preliminary conceptual models and to guide the field characterization. Those models provide a quantitative framework for synthesizing field information and verifying mechanisms readily contributing to a cost-effective decision-making process. This article presents a systematic hydrogeological characterization of a coastal basin in a tropical region of southern Brazil that is affected by intensive precipitation and ocean tides; precipitation is the main process driving groundwater flow, although head variations at the boundaries affect a spatiotemporal distribution of the water table. A set of numerical experiments is deployed to test the understanding of natural processes and to assist additional field campaigns. The hierarchy of hydrogeological processes is evaluated over different scales, to eliminate less sensitive mechanisms. By presenting the detailed setup information on model development, the applications are demonstrated and limitations are discussed in light of the available field data and specific research objectives.",0.109

Thus, stringent regulations establishing limits to the microbiological contamination of water and seafood are needed. The objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of Enterococci and Thermotolerant Coliform densities in the flesh of mussels Perna perna as an alternative tool for monitoring the microbiological quality of coastal waters. The study also considers allometric relations applied to clearance rates to understand rates of bacterial concentration. Bacterial loads obtained in mussels' flesh were from 50 to 4,300 times greater than in the water sampled in the vicinity of the mussels and some were considered inappropriate for consumption even when the water presented no restrictions. The mean clearance rate obtained for Enterococci retention was 317.7 ml h(-1) and this rate (CR) is related to the mussels' size (L) by the equation CR = 28.3229L(1.6421). The results showed that bacterial densities in the mussels' tissues may reflect chronic contamination of the environment and that clearance rates are important for taking the best decision in situations where, for example, it is desired to introduce mussels for aquaculture and the evaluation of the water concerned is required.",0.086

A.; Yulianto, F.; Hizbaron, D. R.; Aerts, J. C. J. H.","Coastal flooding poses serious threats to coastal areas, and the vulnerability of coastal communities and economic sectors to flooding will increase in the coming decades due to environmental and socioeconomic changes. It is increasingly recognised that estimates of the vulnerability of cities are essential for planning adaptation measures. Jakarta is a case in point, since parts of the city are subjected to regular flooding on a near-monthly basis. In order to assess the current and future coastal flood hazard, we set up a GIS-based flood model of northern Jakarta to simulate inundated area and value of exposed assets. Under current conditions, estimated damage exposure to extreme coastal flood events with return periods of 100 and 1,000 years is high ((sic)4.0 and (sic)5.2 billion, respectively). Under the scenario for 2100, damage exposure associated with these events increases by a factor 4-5, with little difference between low/high sea-level rise scenarios. This increase is mainly due to rapid land subsidence and excludes socioeconomic developments. We also develop a detemporalised inundation scenario for assessing impacts associated with any coastal flood scenario. This allows for the identification of critical points above which large increases in damage exposure can be expected and also for the assessment of adaptation options against hypothetical user-defined levels of change, rather than being bound to a discrete set of a priori scenarios. The study highlights the need for urgent attention to the land subsidence problem; a continuation of the current rate would result in catastrophic increases in damage exposure.",0.724

Although a number of studies have evaluated the consequences for terrestrial biodiversity, the effects on wetland habitats and fauna are less well described. This study aims to determine the conservation value of flood-control drainage channels in oil palm smallholdings for waterbirds. We also measured the water quality (water temperature; pH; dissolved oxygen, DO; total dissolved solids, TDS; salinity; water depth; conductivity; and turbidity) and habitat characteristics (vegetation cover and channel width) to determine the relationship between waterbird species richness, water quality, and habitat characteristics. Birds were surveyed along 25 line transects within peat swamp- and mangrove-converted oil palm smallholdings. Data were collected in seven smallholdings between March and December 2013. We recorded a total of 1111 waterbirds from eight resident species. Both mangrove forest- and peat swamp-converted smallholdings had similar waterbird diversity. Waterbird species richness increased with increasing DO and decreased with water depth, temperature, and conductivity. The most parsimonious predictive model (minimum quasi Akaike information criterion = 476.48) explained 52.39 \% of the variation in species richness. Our data indicate that even man-made aquatic habitats, such as flood-control channels, can be important for some waterbirds in oil palm smallholdings. However, considering the relatively small increase in waterbird species richness in channels, the most successful strategy for conserving waterbirds will require protection of intact wetlands supported by better management of drainage channels in oil palm small holdings.",0.057

The Miocene Climatic Optimum (similar to 16.3 to similar to 15 Ma), one of the warmest phases since the Eocene, was followed by the stepwise cooling trend of the Middle Miocene Climate Transition (similar to 15 to similar to 13.7 Ma). The entry into an Earth ``Ice-house{''} climate state took place at the end of the latter (similar to 13.76 Ma) marked by one of the major cooling steps in middle Miocene climate recorded at a global scale (Mi3b event). The Madrid Basin, which is part of one of the main Cenozoic basins of the Iberian Peninsula, contains-a well-represented small-mammal record from the lower middle Miocene to the upper middle Miocene (middle and upper Aragonian, similar to 15.9 to 12.8 Ma), being an appropriate region to check how these climatic phases influenced the distribution of the mammalian faunas on the center of the Iberian Peninsula. Values of species richness, equitability and heterogeneity of rodents have been calculated for 25 localities of the Madrid Basin and compared to detailed climate isotope records from the marine realm (ODP Site 1146 from the South China Sea and the Mediterranean record of the Ras Il Pellegrin section on the Maltese Islands) and with palaeoprecipitation.curves for southwest Europe (Calatayud-Montalban Basin). The results show that the rodent community during the middle and upper Aragonian in the Madrid Basin was subject to the changing climate conditions imposed in the course of the middle Miocene. The palaeoecological curves witness periods of disturbance of the community during changing climate conditions (marked by important drops in equitability and, in some cases, gradual decreases in heterogeneity and species richness), followed by periods showing a recovery of the community and adaptation to the new climate circumstances (represented by more evenly distributed and diverse assemblages). The effects of the Miocene Climate Optimum and of three Mi-events (Mi2b, Mi3a and Mi3b) have been related to changes in the small-mammal community. Between similar to 15.8 and 15.3 Ma, the likely extreme environment (high temperature and low precipitation) of part of the Miocene Climate Optimum may have imposed severe constraints on the fauna, resulting in a community with low values of equitability, heterogeneity and a decreasing number of species. The transition of the Miocene Climate Optimum to the Middle Miocene Climate Transition, reflected by the Mi2b event, has also procured a destabilization of the rodent assemblages, as an important drop in equitability is recorded between-15 and 14.6 Ma. In this interval, the drop in temperature and increase in rainfall derived from the Middle Miocene Climate Transition promote the southwards migration of northern invaders, leading to an increase in species richness in the Madrid Basin. Starting around 14.4 Ma, the onset of a progressive drop in the rodent equitability and heterogeneity, which also coincides with a major stratigraphic discordance in the basin, is related to the first cooling step of the Middle Miocene Climate Transition (Mi3a event). Finally, the major cooling step in middle Miocene climate recorded at a global scale (Mi3b event) is poorly reflected in the palaeoecological curves. However, the taxonomical study of the rodent faunas of that interval (biozone E) has shown turnover rates and morphometric changes that indicate that this period represents one of the most variable in assemblage composition within the Aragonian. Although the Mi3b event has been correlated for a long time to the substitution of the early-middle Aragonian fauna by a late Aragonian community (E-F boundary), the study of the rodent assemblages of the Madrid Basin may point out that small changes in the small-mammal community started before (within biozone E).

An analysis of relevant species trials was carried out to assess the productivity of potential alternative conifer species on upland site types in Britain. Data from 87 forest experiments planted between 1929 and 1995 were analysed to compare long-term performance of 52 species with that of Sitka spruce under the same conditions and site type. Sites were broadly categorized using soil and climatic factors, which were used as primary factors in models predicting General Yield Class (GYC, the maximum mean annual increment in m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)) of the potential alternative species and of Sitka spruce. No species had significantly higher GYC estimates than Sitka spruce, but grand fir (Abies grandis (Douglas ex D. Don) Lindl.), noble fir (Abies procera (Rehder)), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), Lutz's spruce (Picea x lutzii (Little)), maritime pine (Pinus pinaster (Aiton)), Lawson cypress (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (A. Murray bis) Parl.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.)), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata (Donn ex D.Don)) all had GYC estimates which were not significantly lower than that of Sitka spruce under certain soil and climate conditions. A further 26 species, particularly Abies species, had GYC within 3 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) of Sitka spruce but were present on too few sites for inclusion in statistical models. The results of the analysis provide objective evidence for the planting of a wider range of species where Sitka spruce may currently be first choice. In the absence of any major pest or disease affecting Sitka spruce, it is still a good choice for many upland sites, however, a wider range of options with equivalent productivity exist, allowing forest managers to diversify and reduce the risk of damage or loss of production due to biotic or abiotic events.",0.273

We employed electron microprobe and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analyses of fresh glass and adjacent palagonite crusts to determine the geochemical changes involved in palagonite formation. Samples were retrieved from drill cores taken in the North Pond Area, located on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 22 degrees 45N and 46 degrees 05W. We also analyzed whole rock powders to determine the overall crust-seawater exchange in a young ridge flank. Radioactive elements are enriched in palagonite relative to fresh glass, reaching concentrations where radiolytic production of molecular hydrogen (H-2) may be a significant energy source. Based on these results, we hypothesize that microbial ecosystems in ridge flank habitats undergo a transition in the principal energy carrier, fueling carbon fixation from Fe oxidation in very young crust to H-2 consumption in older crust. Unless the H-2 is swept away by rapid fluid flow (i.e., in young flanks), it may easily accumulate to levels high enough to support chemolithoautotrophic life. In older flanks, crustal sealing and sediment accumulation have slowed down seawater circulation, and the significance of radiolytically produced H-2 for catalytic energy supply is expected to increase greatly. Similar habitats on other planetary surfaces are theoretically possible, as accumulation of radiolytically produced hydrogen merely requires the presence of H2O molecules and a porous medium, from which the hydrogen is not lost.",0.045

Sediment samples were collected in July 2010 and 2011 along a bathymetric gradient between 600 m and 2000 m depth, and total mass flux measured at the same depths from July 2010 to July 2011. In both sampling periods sedimentary OM contents and C degradation rates increased significantly with water depth, whereas OM nutritional quality was generally higher at shallower depths, with the unique exception at 600 m depth in 2010. Meiofaunal abundance and biomass (largely dominated by nematodes) showed the highest values at intermediate depths (ca 1500 m) in both sampling periods. The richness of meiofaunal higher taxa and nematode species richness did not vary significantly with water depth in both sampling periods. We suggest here that patterns in OM quantity, C degradation rates, and meiofauna community composition in 2011 were likely influenced by the intensification of the warm West Spitsbergen Current (WSC).

A survey by interviewing randomly selected 90 marine capture fishermen was conducted in Bengkulu from March to June 2018. The results indicate that most fishermen understand climate change as a change of east and west monsoon that directly affect their fishing activities. In terms of climate change defined as a continuous change of temperature, humidity, and rainfall, most fishermen have no sufficient knowledge on climate change.

Part of this variability appeared to be related to environmental conditions prevailing during and after spawning. The growth rate of small individuals (< 50 mm) was correlated with the gradient of increased temperature and food availability going up the bay. In all beds, both total production and reproductive effort increased with increasing age and then leveled off. Somatic production reached a maximum after 7 to 10 yr and then decreased for older scallops. Reproductive effort (percentage of production dedicated to reproduction) increased monotonically with age and, for any given age, followed the increase in temperature and food availability going from the mouth into Bale des Chaleurs.

The carbonates were deposited adjacent and down-dip to large lobes of storm-dominated deltaic complexes during sea-level lowstands, and subsequently transgressed over the 200 m thick prograding siliciclastic wedges during sea-level rise, depositing limestone units between 5 and 20 m thick The deltaic lobes switched through time and caused alternating siliciclastic supply along the shoreline oblique-parallel transect. Condensed limestone successions formed in clastic sediment starved areas due to delta-complex abandonment. Down-gradient, in outer ramp environments, the direct juxtaposition of carbonate and siliciclastic lithofacies associations comprising rhythmic lime mudstones/marls and massive shelf sandstones, provides the opportunity for mutual interpretation of their mode of deposition and bathymetry. This lateral relationship suggests that significant amalgamation took place in falling stage systems tracts to produce laterally extensive shelf sandstone-sheets on the outer ramp. Two types of stacking patterns are observed in prograding siliciclastic wedges. A normal progradational shoreline pattern with well developed parasequence sets in the proximal ramp, and an abrupt-regressive succession in which the amalgamated shelf sandstones rest more or less directly on offshore siltstones in the distal ramp. In the latter case, the falling stage systems tract sandstones are overlain by a relatively thick cyclic alternation with brachiopod-rich storm-beds below a marked transgressive surface at the base of the capping transgressive limestones. The cyclic alternation is interpreted as lowstand systems tract deposits. Marked flooding surfaces on parasequence sets are Fe-enriched and contain abundant articulated brachiopods, indicating breaks in sedimentation and an overall deepening-upward facies from the underlying maximum regression and sequence boundary. These aggradational to retrogradational stacked lowstand systems tracts are thus rather `transgressive', not regressive in character, as is commonly described in sequence stratigraphic ramp models.

First, we analyzed the genetic differentiation among populations using thousands of genetic markers. Second, we measured the physiological tolerance to reduced salinity, a predicted effect of climate change in the study area, by measuring growth, phlorotannin (defense compounds) content, and maximum photochemical yield in tissue of the same individuals exposed to both current and projected future salinities.

Furthermore, populations responded very differently to a salinity decrease of four practical salinity units (psu) corresponding to projected future salinity. At the high salinity end of the gradient, some populations maintained growth at the cost of reduced phlorotannin production. However, at the low salinity end, mortality increased and growth was strongly reduced in one population, while a second population from similar salinity instead maintained growth and phlorotannin production. Among genetic markers that appeared as outliers (showing more genetic differentiation than the majority of loci), we found that four were associated with genes that were potential candidates for being under selection. One of these, a calcium-binding protein gene, also showed a significant genotype-phenotype relationship in the population where this genetic marker was variable. We concluded that local selection pressure, genetic affinity, and possibly also population history could explain the very different responses to reduced salinity among these populations, despite being from the same geographic area. Our results highlight the importance of local perspective in the management of species.",0.055

We propose a single step process to obtain porous carbon nanosheels (CNS) by exploiting the hyperaccumulating pathway in extreme halophyte, Salicornia brachiata. The process was designed so as to achieve seamless hybridization with already existing technologies of salt production while reducing the overall carbon and chemical footprint. Further, CNS were tested as an efficient adsorbent for wastewater remediation. The raw material, dried Saticomia brachiata biomass consisted of roughly similar to 30 w/w\% hyperaccumulated inorganic salts while the organic constituents (cellulose, lignin etc.) made up for the rest. Compartmentalized salt in the plant structure acted as a templating agent while water washing after pyrolysis resulted in exfoliation and pore formation due to its dissolution. Morphology and texture analysis of the carbon material obtained from water washed biomass (salts removed) exemplified the structure and pore directing effect of intrinsic salt. The unwashed pyrolyzed sample (S7-UW) exhibited nominal BET area of similar to 90 m(2)/g while the value increased to similar to 700 m(2)/g for exfoliated CNS obtained after water washing (S7-W). Intrinsic salts not only act as a template, but also catalyses the carbonization process, increases carbon retention during pyrolysis and inhibits restacking of exfoliated graphitized carbon sheets after pyrolysis. S7-W displayed high removal capacity for Pb2+ (55 mg/g), Hg2+ (similar to 100 mg/g), Cd2+ (similar to 250-300 mg/g), maintaining its efficiency under seawater and simulated wastewater conditions.

A better understanding of the influence of sediment characteristics on transport is crucial to establish the best compatibility of fill material with native beach sediments. Pebble transport is here investigated by means of the RFID tracing technique. The main purpose of the experiment was to verify whether the prevalent shapes populating the beach (disks and spheres) show a different transport under low energy conditions. Tracers were injected in a small and straight portion of a mixed sand and gravel beach, deploying couples of marked particles of the same size (one sphere and one disk shaped pebble on the main geomorphic elements of the beach face), in order to avoid size influence on transport. Tracer recovery was undertaken 6 and 24 h after the injection and wave characteristics were measured during the whole experiment duration by means of a S4 directional wave gauge. After 6 h the marked pebbles underwent significant displacement with a prevalent longshore component, which became evident after 24 h. The swash zone proved to be the most dynamic area of the beach. Spheres covered longer distances and resulted more dynamic than disks, thanks to their capability to roll-over in the swash zone. Lately, many experiments have been carried out with marked pebbles, but this is the first time that an experiment is conceived to prove how shape influences pebble transport. Disks are more subject to burial and due to their higher dynamicity spheres are preferred to disks for nourishment fill material. A fill material comprised of spheres is regularly responding to hydrodynamic forces and can positively speed up the beach recovery after storms especially in highly dynamic systems like pocket beaches, typically subjected to beach rotation processes. The results show an implication for coastal managers having to choose fill sources for replenishments.",0.620

Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were measured with a Siemens Ultramat 5E analyser on both outward and return voyages, and 48 discrete air samples were collected with evacuated Pyrex flasks. The delta C-13 values of the CO2 from the flask air samples were measured in the laboratory following well-established procedures. CO2 concentrations in the western basin were characterised by marked variations, ranging from about 381 to about 394 ppmv. Peaks of up to 398 and 415 ppmv were occasionally recorded, in particular close to the Strait of Gibraltar. The delta C-13 values were very homogeneous, with a mean value of -9.70 +/- 0.22 parts per thousand, in contrast with the large delta C-13 fluctuations expected in this basin. The eastern basin, on average, showed far lower CO2 concentrations than those recorded in the western one. The overall range was between about 375 and 398 ppmv, but most values fell between 375 and 388 ppmv. The delta C-13 values of the discrete air samples were also very homogeneous, with a mean value of -9.37 +/- 0.16 parts per thousand, less negative than that of the western basin. The CO2 concentrations were slightly lower than those measured in December 2007 in the eastern Mediterranean in contrast with the hypothesis of heavy summer pollution in the Mediterranean basins. No quantitative relationship was found between CO2 concentrations and delta C-13 values. This discrepancy may be the effect of the large biospheric sink of CO2 on land and of the plant isotopic discrimination against C-13. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0.032

To improve the use of Cymodocea nodosa seedlings, obtained from seeds germinated in vitro, in restoration programs, we investigated the ammonium and phosphate uptake rates of seedlings, and the synergistic effects of light levels (20 and 200 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) and different nitrogen to phosphorus molar ratios (40 mu M N:10 mu M P, 25 mu M N:25 mu M P, and 10 mu N:40 mu M P) on the photosynthetic activity and growth of seedlings. The nutrient content of seedlings was also compared to the seed nutrient reserves to assess the relative importance of external nutrient uptake for seedling development. Eighty two percent of the seeds germinated after 48 days at a mean rate of 1.5 seeds per day. All seedlings under all treatments survived and grew during the 4 weeks of the experiment. Seedlings of C. nodosa acquired ammonium and phosphate from the incubation media while still attached to the seed, at rates of about twice of adult plants. The relevance of external nutrient uptake was further highlighted by the observation that seedlings' tissues were richer in nitrogen and phosphorus than non-germinated seeds. The uptake of ammonium followed saturation kinetics with a half saturation constant of 32 mu M whereas the uptake of phosphate increased linearly with nutrient concentration within the range tested (5 - 100 mu M). Light was more important than the nutrient ratio of fertilization for the successful development of the young seedlings. The seedlings' photosynthetic and growth rates were about 20\% higher in the high light treatment, whereas different nitrogen to phosphorus ratios did not significantly affect growth. The photosynthetic responses of the seedlings to changes in the light level and their capacity to use external nutrient sources showed that seedlings of C. nodosa have the ability to rapidly acclimate to the surrounding light and nutrient environment while still attached to the seeds. C. nodosa seedlings experiencing fertilization under low light levels showed slightly enhanced growth if nourished with a balanced formulation, whereas a slight increase in growth was also observed with unbalanced formulations under a higher light level.

The depositional flux of PAHs generally showed an increasing trend from the deeper layers towards the upper layer sediments. The fluxes of PAHs were low with little variability before the 1950s, and then gradually increased to the late 1980s, with a faster increasing rate after the 1990s. This temporal pattern is clearly different compared with those remote lakes across the European mountains when PAHs started to decrease during the period 1960s-1980s. The difference of the temporal trend was attributed to differences in the economic development stages and energy structure between these regions. PAHs are dominated by the lighter 2\&3-ring homologues with the averaged percentage over 87\%, while it is notable that the percentage of heavier 4-6 ring PAHs generally increased in recent years, which suggests the contribution of local high-temperature combustion sources becoming more predominant.

Thus, utilizing efficient carrier frequencies in UWA systems can considerably reduce the path loss. In this context, this paper presents an approximate formula for determining the best carrier frequency based on both the system and environmental parameters. To achieve this goal, this research first addresses a simple algorithm including general steps for tuning the parameters of Francois and Garrison (FG) formula in the frequency range of 10 to 100 kHz based on the appropriate experimental data which can be acquired from any interest region. Second, for a more accurate modeling of path loss, this paper considers the loss due to the reflections of sound from both the rough surface and bottom of the sea by employing the ray theory. Third, this study presents a general algorithm for modification of the power spectral density (PSD) of ambient noise based on Wenz formula in the frequency range of 10 to 100 kHz and the required experimental measurements which can be simply collected from any interest channel. Moreover, it is mathematically demonstrated that the ambient noise in the frequency range of 10 to 100 kHz, can be generally approximated with a strict sense stationary (SSS) colored normal stochastic process which is ergodic not only in mean and covariance but also in distribution. Finally, an approximate formula for the best carrier frequency is derived by maximizing the sound to noise intensity ratio (SNR). To verify the validity of simplifications and approximations utilized in this study and to assess the performance of our proposed algorithms and formulas, experimental results obtained in the Strait of Hormuz (SoH) are compared with the original, simplified, and modified models under different scenarios.

Previous studies have analyzed the relationship between shoreline retreat by storms and offshore energy flux of waves E-f to estimate shoreline position. In the present study, the combined effect of the maximum wave run-up level of sea waves R on beaches and E-f was used to analyze shoreline retreat. Eighteen peak storms were selected from shoreline data for Hasaki Coast, Japan, from 1987 to 2006, and shoreline retreat was analyzed for two phases of erosion: storm phase and post-storm phase. The R. E-f concept was shown to be applicable for estimating shoreline retreat in both phases of erosion. Because berm erosion tends to occur during storm-phase erosion, shoreline retreat is likely to occur during storm-phase rather than during post-storm erosion. Therefore, R. E-f per meter in storm-phase erosion, and particularly for peak storms, is much less than that in post-storm phase. It was also found that R. E-f per meter increases with landward shoreline retreat in both phases of erosion. The maximum annual shoreline position at Hasaki Coast was also analyzed statistically, and returns period (RP) was determined using cumulative frequency techniques. RP versus maximum shoreline position was plotted to determine the probable eroded shoreline position that would likely occur within a given period of time. It was found that the trend of the return period changes at 5 years and that the RP of the maximum shoreline position at a distance of 36 m landward from the foot of Hasaki pier is 24 years.",0.064

We used marine sediment organic carbon to determine the role of historic climate variability and human habitation in carbon burial over the past 5,071 years. There was centennial-scale sensitivity of carbon supply and burial to climatic variability, with Little Ice Age cooling causing an abrupt ecosystem shift and an increase in marine carbon contributions compared to terrestrial carbon. Although land use changes during the late 1800s did not cause marked alteration in average carbon burial, they did lead to marked increases in the spatial variability of carbon burial. Thus, while carbon burial by vegetated systems is expected to increase with projected climate warming over the coming century, ecosystem restructuring caused by abrupt climate change may produce unexpected change in carbon burial whose variability is also modulated by land use change.",0.045

Understanding the role of environmental change in the decline of endangered species is critical for designing scale-appropriate restoration plans. For locally endemic rare plants on the brink of extinction, frugivory can drastically reduce local recruitment by dispersing seeds away from geographically isolated populations. Dispersal of seeds away from isolated populations can ultimately lead to population decline. For localized endemic plants, fine-scale changes in microhabitat can further limit population persistence. Evaluating the individual and combined impact of frugivores and microhabitat heterogeneity on the short-term (i.e. transient) and long-term (i.e. asymptotic) dynamics of plants will provide insight into the drivers of species rarity. 2. In this study, we used 4 years of demographic data to develop matrix projection models for a long-lived shrub, Cyrtandra dentata (H. St. John \& Storey) (Gesneriaceae), which is endemic to the island of O'ahu in Hawai'i. Furthermore, we evaluated the individual and combined influence of a non-native frugivorous bird, Leiothrix lutea, and microhabitat heterogeneity on the short-term and long-term C. dentata population dynamics. 3. Frugivory by L. lutea decreased the short-term and long-term population growth rates. However, under the current level of frugivory at the field site the C. dentata population was projected to persist over time. Conversely, the removal of optimum microhabitat for seedling establishment (i.e. rocky gulch walls and boulders in the gulch bottom) reduced the shortterm and long-term population growth rates from growing to declining. 4. Survival of mature C. dentata plants had the greatest influence on long-term population dynamics, followed by the growth of seedlings and immature plants. The importance of mature plant survival was even greater when we simulated the combined effect of frugivory and the loss of optimal microhabitat, relative to population dynamics based on field conditions. In the short-term (10 years), however, earlier life stages had the greatest influence on population growth rate. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study emphasizes how important it is to decouple rare plant management strategies in the short vs. long-term in order to prioritize restoration actions, particularly when faced with multiple stressors not all of which can be feasibly managed. From an applied conservation perspective, our findings also illustrate that the life stage that, if improved by management, would have the greatest influence on population dynamics is dependent on the timeframe of interest and initial conditions of the population.",0.142

Specifically, we assessed farming practices of a coastal smallholder farming community in Kilifi County (hereinafter Kilifi), Kenya, to identify barriers to climate services' effective use. The smallholder farmers in Kilifi represent many smallholder farming communities in East Africa whose primary livelihood is rainfed agriculture. First, we carried out an analysis of historical and future rainfall patterns over Kilifi to determine the area's climate patterns. We used a set of five descriptors of rainfall in Kilifi representing seasonal mean daily precipitation and annual precipitation intensity (SDII) and rainy days (R1MM) for the analysis. We assessed March-May (MAM), June-August (JJA), and October-December (OND) seasons, corresponding to the three planting seasons in Kilifi. Here, values for the five descriptors in the historical period (1977-2005) were compared with those in the future period (2071-2099) to determine the potential changes in the rainfall patterns. Results showed high year-to-year rainfall variability, relatively low mean daily rainfall per season, high variability within seasons, and uneven distribution of rainfall within seasons. MAM, OND, and SDII showed an increase in the future period while JJA recorded a considerable reduction in rainfall. No discernible changes were recorded for R1MM. Results from a social survey showed that the smallholder farmers in Kilifi were indeed experiencing climate variability and change. While some effort had been made towards building the farmers' adaptive capacity, the interventions were reported to be too sporadic and inadequately coordinated to achieve meaningful results. Through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), Key-Informant Interviews (KIIs), and literature review, an innovative climate change adaptation model was developed.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms and processes behind these blooms remain a subject of considerable debate. We analyzed the influence of deep mixing during winter on the spring phytoplankton bloom in the Cantabrian Sea (southern Bay of Biscay). To this end, we combined long-term physical and biogeochemical in situ data (1993-2012) and satellite observations (1997-2012). Deeper winter mixing led to higher nitrate and chlorophyll concentrations through the water column during the spring bloom. However, this effect was modified by short-term variability in near-surface stratification in spring. Winter-mixing preconditioning also influenced different spring bloom metrics: deeper and later mixing in winter was followed by later blooms with a larger peak. In these enhanced blooms, nitrate was taken up at faster rates, indicating higher rates of phytoplankton production. Winters with weaker mixing (that led to weaker spring blooms) were associated with warmer surface temperatures. This relationship suggests that the multi-decadal trend toward warmer surface temperatures in the Bay of Biscay may promote a decrease in the magnitude of the spring bloom, which could impact upper trophic levels and also deep carbon export in the future.",0.025

L.","With communities increasingly concentrated in coastal regions globally, governments and stakeholders call for cohesive risk assessments for future sustainability in the wake of natural hazards. This can only be achieved through risk-based decision-making and smart resources treatment. To provide a basis for such actions, we here propose a risk assessment (RA) framework focusing on the risk-resilience-sustainability nexus. In contrast to focusing on the traditional RA approach, we propose an integrative approach based on hazard, vulnerability, and resilience covering the full spectrum of RA for effective risk reduction. We further explain how the proposed framework can simultaneously provide useful input for resilience management in parallel to achieving certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We apply this framework for typhoon risk assessment (represented by a Typhoon Risk Index-TRI) of coastal counties of mainland China. Different TRIs e.g. total population, elderly population, non-adult population, and economic status are calculated for each coastal county to supplement multi-objective empirical measures for risk reduction. The RA results show a large spatial heterogeneity in typhoon risk with an increase in the risk from north to south along the coast of mainland China. The comparative results from this study are relevant to the prioritization of different regions for immediate or gradual actions, wise decision-making, and risk reduction through proper treatment of resources-related policy implications. The evaluation of the SDGs achievement status reveals that the overall performance of coastal provinces in mainland China is higher to achieve SDGs 3 and 15 followed by 13 and 8. The study shows that while Guangdong province is in the highest risk category, its achievement status for SDG-13 (climate actions, strengthening resilience) is the lowest relative to other provinces, which is critical.

Similarly, it has been suggested, and sometimes shown, that decreasing soil N via carbon (C) additions can facilitate native species recovery. Yet all species are unlikely to respond to resource supply in the same way. We asked how soil nutrients and competition affect native and exotic woody species in a restoration experiment where we added N or C, and crossed soil manipulation with the manipulation of dominant exotic grass abundance in a Hawaiian subtropical woodland. We related changes in survival and growth of outplanted individuals to native/exotic status and plant traits. As a group, N-fixers showed reduced survival compared to non-fixers in response to added N, with Morella faya (exotic) and Acacia koa (native) having dramatic negative responses. Among non-fixers, species with greater foliar \%N had more positive survival responses to increasing soil N. Specific leaf area was not predictive of responses to nutrients or competition. In general, responses to carbon addition were weak, although reducing competition from existing exotic grasses was beneficial for all outplanted species, with N-fixers showing the most positive response. We conclude that commonly used restoration strategies to clear exotic species or lower soil resources with C addition will most greatly benefit N-fixing species, which themselves may be unwanted invaders. Thus statements about the influence of increased soil N on invasions should be carefully dissected by considering the traits (such as N-fixation status) of the regional species pool.",0.108

We argue that the monetary value measurement of CME services for MPAs should be based on the biophysical production of services in MPAs rather than from subjective human perspectives (e.g., Willingness to Pay surveys). This requires transdisciplinary knowledge connecting ecology and economy, to produce an ecology-based monetary value measurement.

In a changing climate, with a rising global sea level, potentially changing patterns in storm tracks and storminess, and rising population density and pressures on the coastal zone, the future risk of coastal storm impacts is likely to increase. Coastal managers and policy makers therefore need to make effective and timely decisions on the use of resources for the immediate and longer term.

The growing transfer of information between the science community and end-users is enabling leading research to have a greater impact on the socioeconomic resilience of coastal communities. This special issue covers recent research activities relating to coastal hazard mapping in response to extreme events, economic impacts of long-term change, coastal processes influencing management decisions and the development of online decision support tools.",0.645

F.; Taylor, Jane; Emmett, Martin","Thermal regulation is a key ecosystem service provided by urban plants. In addition to summer cooling, plants can insulate buildings against heat loss in winter. Research was conducted over two winters using replicated small-scale physical models to simulate heat loss from a built structure and to investigate the insulation properties of plants during cold weather. Brick cuboids were constructed around a water tank maintained at 16 degrees C and energy use monitored. Covering cuboids with ivy (Hedera helix) reduced mean energy consumption by 21\% compared to bare cuboids during the first winter (means of 4.3 and 5.4 kWh per week, respectively). During the second winter, when foliage was more extensive a 37\% mean saving was achieved (3.7 compared to 5.9 kWh per week). The presence of Hedera enhanced brick temperatures significantly compared to bare walls. Temperature differences were affected by weather parameters, aspect, diurnal time and canopy density. Largest savings in energy due to vegetation were associated with more extreme weather, such as cold temperatures, strong wind or rain. Under such scenarios green facades could increase energy efficiency by 40-50\% and enhance wall surface temperatures by 3 degrees C. These empirical studies with replicated treatments augment previous research based on urban modelling and data from non-replicated individual buildings in situ. They indicate that planting design requires more attention to ensure the heat saving aspects associated with green facades and shelter belts are optimised. These aspects are discussed within the context of wider urban ecosystem services provided by vegetation, and implications for climate change mitigation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Only the land-surface parts of hydrological cycles are directly visible and represented in local knowledge and water-related legislation. Human impacts on water cycles (HIWC) can, beyond climate change, arise through effects on local and regional hydrological processes, from both reduced and increased water use compared to a natural reference vegetation with which landscape structure and hydrology are aligned. Precipitationsheds, the oceanic and terrestrial origin of rainfall, depend on evapotranspiration and thus on vegetation. The political commitment to reduce agricultural impact on nature requires hydrological mimetrics to trickle down through institutions to actions. Existing metrics do not suffice. For example, the water footprint metric that relates agricultural water use to consumption decisions, suggests minimizing water use is best, ignoring full hydrological impacts. We explore principles, criteria and indicators for understanding HIWC, via modified evapotranspiration, effects on streamflow (downstream impacts) and atmospheric fluxes and precipitation (downwind impacts). Comprehensive HIWC mimetrics for a set of pantropical watersheds suggest hydrological mimicry options for forest-derived land use patterns through intermediate densities of trees with diversity in rooting depth and water use, interacting with soils, crops and livestock.",0.156

J.; Link, H.; Chaillou, G.; Sempere, R.","For the next decades significant climatic changes should occur in the Arctic zone. The expected destabilisation of permafrost and its consequences for hydrology and plant cover should increase the input of terrigenous carbon to coastal seas. Consequently, the relative importance of the fluxes of terrestrial and marine organic carbon to the seafloor will likely change, strongly impacting the preservation of organic carbon in Arctic marine sediments. Here, we investigated the lipid content of surface sediments collected on the Mackenzie basin in the Beaufort Sea. Particular attention was given to biotic and abiotic degradation products of sterols and monounsaturated fatty acids. By using sitosterol and campesterol degradation products as tracers of the degradation of terrestrial higher plant inputs and brassicasterol degradation products as tracers of degradation of phytoplanktonic organisms, it could be observed that autoxidation, photooxidation and biodegradation processes act much more intensively on higher plant debris than on phytoplanktonic organisms. Examination of oxidation products of monounsaturated fatty acids showed that photo- and autoxidation processes act more intensively on bacteria than on phytodetritus. Enhanced damages induced by singlet oxygen ( transferred from senescent phytoplanktonic cells) in bacteria were attributed to the lack of an adapted antioxidant system in these microorganisms. The strong oxidative stress observed in the sampled sediments resulted in the production of significant amounts of epoxy acids and unusually high proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids with a trans double bond. The formation of epoxy acids was attributed to peroxygenases (enzymes playing a protective role against the deleterious effects of fatty acid hydroperoxides in vivo), while cis/trans isomerisation was probably induced by thiyl radicals produced during the reaction of thiols with hydroperoxides. Our results confirm the important role played by abiotic oxidative processes in the degradation of marine bacteria and do not support the generally expected refractory character of terrigenous material deposited in deltaic systems.",0.045

L.; Giering, S. L. C.; Wolff, G. A.; Trimmer, M.; Sanders, R.","A fraction of organic carbon produced in the oceans by phytoplankton sinks storing 5-15 gigatonnes of carbon annually in the ocean interior. The accepted paradigm is that rapid aggregation of phytoplankton cells occurs, forming large, fresh particles which sink quickly; this concept is incorporated into ecosystem models used to predict the future climate. Here we demonstrate a slower, less efficient export pathway in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. Lipid biomarkers suggest that the large, fast-sinking particles found beneath the mixed layer are compositionally distinct from those found in the mixed layer and thus not directly and efficiently formed from phytoplankton cells. We postulate that they are formed from the in situ aggregation of smaller, slow-sinking particles over time in the mixed layer itself. This export pathway is likely widespread where smaller phytoplankton species dominate. Its lack of representation in biogeochemical models suggests that they may be currently overestimating the ability of the oceans to store carbon if large, fast-sinking, labile particles dominate simulated particle export. Plain Language Summary The oceans are one of the largest sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide on our planet. One method by which this occurs is through the production of organic material (phytoplankton-plant-like cells) in the surface ocean, which capture atmospheric carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Eventually, the phytoplankton die and sink out of the surface ocean, transporting huge amounts of carbon to the deep ocean where it is stored for centuries or even millennia. Our current understanding is that generally, most organic material sinks quickly as large, fast-sinking (hundreds of meters per day) particles (clumps of dead phytoplankton cells). However, in our study in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean, we were able to show that a different and much slower process occurs where phytoplankton first aggregate to smaller, slower sinking detrital particles and eventually form very degraded larger particles that sink to the deep. This has consequences for estimating ocean carbon storage as smaller particles are respired much quicker than larger particles. Thus, where they are an important part of this carbon sink, such as in the Equatorial Pacific, the proportion phytoplankton-captured atmospheric carbon dioxide being stored in the deep ocean is likely reduced.",0.113

However, its potability in most coastal communities is often threatened by seawater intrusion. This study employed a combination of methods including the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline values, water quality index (WQI), ionic ratios, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), percent sodium (\%Na), permeability index (PI) and electrical conductivity (EC) to assess the quality of groundwater in some coastal communities of the Central Region of Ghana, for domestic and irrigation purposes. Physico-chemical data from sixty-nine (69) boreholes in the communities were acquired for the study; NaCl (43\%), MgHCO3(20\%) and mixed CaMgCl (20\%) were found to be the dominant water types in the groundwater of the study area. About 61\% of the communities had excellent to good groundwater quality for domestic use per WHO guideline values and WQI analyses whereas 43\% had suitable groundwater to support plant growth and crop yield based on the PI, SAR, \% Na, and EC analyses. However, there were elevated concentrations of the major ions close to the sea, and the ionic ratios revealed that seawater intrusion may be the cause of the high salinity in the groundwater of most communities in the area.

Yet, in many places widespread degradation (caused by overgrazing) severely threatens the natural resource base and prospects for future food security and sustainable development. On Samothraki, a Greek island, several decades of continuous increase of the local livestock population, exceeding not only the local food base by far but also the local farmers' ability to provide supplementary feed, led to a socio-ecological tipping point turning the dynamics downward. Still, in the face of very restricted marketing opportunities, we find local farmers in an economic deadlock of relying on CAP subsidies as a main source of income and on still too high animal numbers for maintaining an ecological balance of their land while lacking the labor power (due to large-scale migration to Germany in the 1950s and 60 s) to apply adequate management practices. In this paper, we present a feed balance (feed-demand and supply) for sheep and goats from 1970 to 2012 and discuss causes and effects of the excessive growth in animal numbers, as well as reasons for their downturn in the last decade. We describe the island's groundcover and symptoms of soil degradation, and underline our findings by reference to a remote sensing approach.

Therefore, in consideration of the safety issue, this study was conducted to assess the concentration of such metals (Cd, Cu, Zn, Fe, and Pb) in the muscles of most widely consumed fish species (Barbonymus schwanenfeldii, Puntius bulum, Puntius daruphani, Hexanematichthys sagor, Channa striatus, Mystacoleucus marginatus, and Devario regina) from different locations of Perak River, Malaysia by employing inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

Climate change is likely to have a substantial impact on fish production that can lead to a fragile food security condition in the country. This paper assesses the potential economic impact of three important climate change adaptation strategies - natural resource management (NRM), fish aggregating devices (FAD) and aquaculture - in Solomon Islands. The study used a country-specific partial equilibrium economic model with six fish sub-sectors and analyzed potential impact of alternate climate change adaptation strategies for 2035 and 2050. The modeling and scenario analyses show that total fish demand is likely to surpass domestic fish production in 2050. Without appropriate climate adaptation strategy, per capita consumption of domestically produced fish will decline, which has serious negative food security implications for the country. The economic (welfare) analysis conducted based on modeling results show that the national level net economic gains due to climate change adaptation strategies are substantial. If cost and topographic conditions permit, low-cost inshore FADs are expected to be a good mechanism for augmenting domestic supplies of tuna and similar species in Solomon Islands.

The introduced method was to bring the Si into the Au and enabled the Si concentration to be varied from 5 to 15 at.\% in the braze. It was then possible to study the effect of this parameter on the joints' microstructure, as well as the mechanical performance. The detailed microstructure of the graphite/braze interface, braze, Hastelloy N beside the braze seam, was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The results show that Si with accurate control in quantity will produce a robust graphite/Hastelloy N alloy joint, due to its strong effect in modifying the microstructure. When incorporating 5 at.\% Si, the obtained maximum joint shear strength is 32.5 MPa, equal to the strength of graphite substrates. The underlying factor that Si affects the microstructure and joint bond strength was unveiled.

Karst systems can be extremely complex, heterogeneous, and unpredictable due to the wide range of geological and hydrological controlling factors. The great variability results in serious problems for engineers, and in difficulties to characterize the karstified rock masses, and in designing the engineering works to be performed. The design and development of engineering projects in karst environments require specific approaches aimed at minimizing the detrimental effects of hazardous processes and environmental problems. Further, karst aquifers (that provide approximately 20-25 \% of the world's drinking water) are extremely vulnerable to pollution, due to the direct connection between the surface and the subsurface drainage, the rapidity of the water flow in conduit networks, and the very low depuration capability. Sinkholes are the main source of engineering problems in karst environments, and may cause severe damage in any human structure. The strategies and solutions that may be applied to mitigate sinkhole problems are highly variable and largely depend on the kind of engineering structure, the karst setting, and the typology and size of the sinkholes. A sound geological model, properly considering the peculiarities of karst and its interactions with the human environment, is essential for the design of cost-effective and successful risk reduction programs. Due to the unique direct interaction between surface and subsurface environments, and the frequent ground instability problems related to underground karstification, management of karst environments is a very delicate matter. Disregarding such circumstances in land-use planning and development inevitably results in severe problems with high economic impacts. Karst environments require specific investigation methods in order to properly manage and safeguard the sensitive geo-ecosystems and natural resources associated with them.",0.166

In this article, we argue that supply-shaping, achieved through proactive curtailment associated with PV oversupply, is actually critical to achieving intermittency mitigation and delivering firm PV generation at the lowest cost. We investigate the premium to transform a low-cost, but intermittent solar kWh into a firm, effectively dispatchable kWh. We show that a fundamental ingredient of minimizing this premium is to optimally overbuild and, as necessary and appropriate, curtail PV generation. Drawing on a case study in the State of Minnesota, we show that firm, high-penetration-ready PV generation could be achieved at a production cost at or below current conventional generation, especially when optimally coupled with wind generation. We conclude with a recommendation that in order to achieve this lowest cost firm generation potential, proactive curtailment strategies should inform future transactional PV remuneration systems.",0.124

In this study, we quantified and mapped 10 ESs in 1986, 1992, 1998, 2004, 2010, and 2015 in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) region.

In this study, we utilized Illumina next-generation amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the seasonal bacterial communities in the sediments and pore waters of three contrasted temperate freshwater lakes, namely Pavin, Aydat, and Grangent (French Massif Central). Despite occupying seemingly similar habitats, bacterial communities differed substantially between sediments and pore waters at all seasons with low sharing of operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 6.7 to 20.3\%) between them. Sediment-associated bacteria were more rich and diverse than pore water bacteria, indicating a high heterogeneity in the sediment microhabitat.

Such processes determine how heat from the sun is redistributed across the global oceans, directly impacting large-and small-scale weather and climate patterns. The provision of daily maps of global SST for operational systems, climate modeling and the broader scientific community is now a mature and sustained service coordinated by the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) and the CEOS SST Virtual Constellation (CEOS SST-VC). Data streams are shared, indexed, processed, quality controlled, analyzed, and documented within a Regional/Global Task Sharing (R/GTS) framework, which is implemented internationally in a distributed manner. Products rely on a combination of low-Earth orbit infrared and microwave satellite imagery, geostationary orbit infrared satellite imagery, and in situ data from moored and drifting buoys, Argo floats, and a suite of independent, fully characterized and traceable in situ measurements for product validation (Fiducial Reference Measurements, FRM). Research and development continues to tackle problems such as instrument calibration, algorithm development, diurnal variability, derivation of high-quality skin and depth temperatures, and areas of specific interest such as the high latitudes and coastal areas. In this white paper, we review progress versus the challenges we set out 10 years ago in a previous paper, highlight remaining and new research and development challenges for the next 10 years (such as the need for sustained continuity of passive microwave SST using a 6.9 GHz channel), and conclude with needs to achieve an integrated global high-resolution SST observing system, with focus on satellite observations exploited in conjunction with in situ SSTs. The paper directly relates to the theme of Data Information Systems and also contributes to Ocean Observing Governance and Ocean Technology and Networks within the OceanObs2019 objectives.

Given the lack of information regarding the effects of high CO2 on olfactory-mediated mating behaviours in crustaceans, the possible chemosensory disruption in male mate-tracking in the keystone amphipod (Gammarus locusta) was assessed (after a two-generation acclimation to high CO2 conditions). In a series of behavioural trials, the response time, first direction of movement and the proportion of time spent in the presence of female scent cues were quantified. The possibility of high CO2-induced metabolic changes was assessed through routine metabolic rate (RMR) quantification. We found that hypercapnia was responsible for inducing a delay in response time latency and effectively disrupted accurate female cue-tracking. Moreover, RMR were significantly reduced under high CO2 in both genders. Such finding supports the hypothesis of hypercapnia-induced metabolic depression, which potentially underpins the increased latency in response time verified. Overall, the present study hints the potential disruption of chemosensory-dependent sexual behaviours, through some degree of chemosensory and metabolic disruption. These results emphasize the need for further behavioural tests regarding chemosensory communication in amphipods and energy metabolism, and suggest cascading consequences for the species' reproductive success and overall fitness in a future less alkaline ocean.",0.047

The community and regional planning field is awakening to the importance of culture as a concern in planning, including community well being, distinctiveness, cohesion, and capacity. Since planning is often conducted with a spatial focus, the concept of cultural landscapes is a potentially useful tool, and in particular for climate change and sea level rise adaptation. This article describes an action research project for local sea level rise adaptation planning that attended to cultural landscapes. The planning process asked: (1) What core cultural landscapes are important to maintain? (2) What cultural landscapes may be lost due to external changes and adaptation choices? and (3) What cultural landscape adaptive capacities exist to achieve community resilience? The project communities are the towns of Yankeetown and Inglis, neighboring small towns situated in the rural Gulf coast of Florida. The project found that locally significant cultural landscapes emerge when residents participate in planning processes, and that these landscapes hold new keys to successful adaptation.",0.966

The survey is based on the opinion of a group of 20 experts representing different fields of earth and technical sciences. They represent Norway and Poland, where the location of such a system is considered. Based on experts' experience and opinions, all factors that seem to be significant were classified into the following groups: targets, key factors, results, determiners, motor and brakes, regulating factors, external factors, auxiliary factors, and autonomous factors. Direct influences between variables were indicated. Due to major differences in geological conditions in Poland and Norway, the factor of on- or offshore technology was pointed out as the primary determiner. Among key factors, the system operation's long-term safety and level of technological readiness were indicated. As a target factor, an interest of local authority was pointed out. Among the variables that are important when selecting locations for this type of system, nine are essential: (1) Formal constraints related to local nature protection areas-this variable is essential in the case of an onshore system; (2) Availability of CO2 sources; (3) Level of geological recognition; (4) The distance of the CO2-EGS from a thermal energy user and electricity grid; (5) Existing wells and other infrastructure; (6) Depth of the EGS system; (7) Water depth if offshore, this variable is only important when offshore systems are involved; (8) Physical parameters of reservoir rocks; (9) Reservoir temperature.",0.706

In this study, we integrated the available scientific information of the system to develop a preliminary trophic mass-balance model to characterize the ecosystem structure and functioning, evaluate the ecological impacts of fishing on the ecosystem, and compare the results of the ecosystem assessment to those of previous single-species stock assessments. The model includes 23 functional groups aggregated into linear food chains, which resulted in nine discrete trophic levels sensu Lindeman (1942). Results from the mixed trophic impacts showed a bottom-up control in the system where herbivory dominated the energy flow to higher trophic levels but with a significant export of detritus out of the system. With a mean transfer efficiency of 12.6\%, Finn cycling index 7.3\%, path length 2.7, system omnivory index 0.19, and system ascendency and overhead 27 and 73\%, respectively, it would appear that Gazi Bay is immature and perturbed likely due to fishery-induced exploitation. Overall, the fishery is operating at a level of primary consumers with a mean trophic level of the catch of 2.38. Fishing mortality is by far the leading cause of total mortality with the computed exploitation rates suggesting heavy exploitation of the key commercial species (F/Z > 0.5). A comparison of the results of the percentage of primary production required to sustain fisheries and the average trophic level of catch (\%PPR-TLc) with those from similar tropical coastal systems shows that Gazi Bay is comparable to some of the most intensively exploited coastal ecosystems. This implies the impacts of the fishery are evident both at the species and ecosystem level, and there may be a need for precautionary measures for fisheries management.",0.155

It is critical to quantify the temperature sensitivity of soil nitrogen (N) and C mineralization in response to external labile C or N addition in different types of wetland. Through incubation experiments, the effects of temperature and the addition of N or C on soil C and N mineralization were tested using soils from the Sanjiang Plain wetland (SW), Zoige alpine wetland (ZW), Yellow River estuary wetland (YW), and Baiyangdian Lake (BL). Our findings showed that temperature, available C and wetland type were dominant factors in the regulation of soil C loss, with soil C in SW and ZW being less stable and poorly resistant to increases in temperature. The response of net N mineralization to N addition showed regional differences. A lack of long-term effects of the deposition of N on soil mineralization suggested that there may be a particular N addition threshold level for changed C and N mineralization. It is predicted that an increase in labile C supply due to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and its interactions with wetland types will increase CO2 efflux more than N deposition in wetland soils.",0.559

The supply of freshwater to estuarine and nearshore environments in a ridge-to-reef system supports the food, water, and habitats utilized by marine fauna. In addition, the ecosystem services derived from this land-to-sea connectivity support social and cultural practices (hereafter referred to as sociocultural) including fishing, aquaculture, wetland agriculture, religious ceremonies, and recreational activities. To effectively guide island resource management, a better understanding of the linkages from ridge-to-reef across natural and social usages is critical, particularly in the context of climate change, with anticipated increasing temperature and shifting precipitation patterns. The objective of this study was to identify spatial linkages that promote multiple and diverse uses, following the ridge-to-reef concept, at an island-wide scale to identify regions of high conservation importance for aquatic resources. We selected the Island of Maui as a study representative of many Pacific islands. Diverse datasets, including agricultural lands within watersheds, wetland locations, presence of stream species, indicators of freshwater input from streams, coral cover, nearshore fish biomass, sociocultural data such as fishpond locations, wetland taro cultivation, beach recreation use, and lastly the dynamically downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase (CMIP5) future climate projections scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 \& 8.5) were used to examine the spatial linkages through hydrological connectivity from land to the sea. Zonation spatial planning software was used to prioritize areas of high management and conservation value and to help inform aquatic resources management. The resulting prioritized areas included many minimally disturbed watersheds in east Maui and western nearshore and coastal zones that are adjacent to diverse coral reefs. These results are driven by the importance of fish biomass and coral reef distribution as well as traditional wetland taro cultivation and coastal access points for recreation. These results underline the importance of examining ridge-to-reef systems for aquatic resource management and including important social and cultural values in resource management upon planning adaptation strategies for climate change. Improving our understanding of diverse natural and socio-cultural influences on habitat conditions and their values in these areas provides an opportunity to strategically plan future management and conservation actions.",0.684

Since 2009 technology banding has been added, meaning that different technologies are rewarded with a different number of certificates. We analyze these two different renewable obligation policies in a mathematical representation of an electricity market with random availabilities of renewable generation outputs and random electricity demand. We also present another, alternative, banding policy. We provide revenue adequate pricing schemes for the three obligation policies. We carry out a simulation study via sampling. A key finding is that the UK banding policy cannot guarantee that the original obligation target is met, hence potentially resulting in more pollution. Our alternative provides a way to make sure that the target is met while supporting less established technologies, but it comes with a significantly higher consumer price. Furthermore, as an undesirable side effect, we observe that a cost reduction in a technology with a high banding (namely offshore wind) leads to more CO2 emissions under the UK banding policy and to higher consumer prices under the alternative banding policy.

With many insecticides for wireworm control now disappearing worldwide, there is an urgent need for lower risk, efficacious, and cost-effective alternative strategies for use in the twenty first century. To address this need, a novel intercrop attract-and-kill (A\&K) method for controlling wireworm damage to tubers and reducing wireworms was evaluated in British Columbia (Agriotes obscurus), and Ontario (Melanotus spp.). Wheat seed treated with fipronil and/or thiamethoxam was planted in-furrow alongside untreated mother tubers. In BC trials, wheat seed treated with fipronil, or fipronil plus thiamethoxam, provided comparable blemish reductions to in-furrow granular applications of Thimet 15G, containing phorate. With these A\&K treatments, mean reduction in wireworms relative to untreated controls ranged from 89 to 100 \%, as compared to a 59.2 \% reduction with Thimet. In the Ontario studies, mean blemish reductions of 81.2 \% occurred with intercropped fipronil-treated wheat, and a 66.6 \% reduction in damage with fipronil plus thiamethoxam in comparison to Thimet (83.4 \% reduction). Reduction in potato yield due to competition with intercropped wheat was seldom observed. It is concluded that an A\&K strategy with wheat treated with fipronil at 5 g active ingredient (AI)/100 kg seed would require only 3.4 g AI/ha, relative to 3250 g AI of phorate/ha to achieve comparable control. This A\&K strategy offers a highly effective means of wireworm blemish and population control; has low environmental risk; and would be comparable to the cost of currently used prophylactic insecticide treatments such as phorate.",0.123

This paper summarizes insights gained from five years of integrated assessment activity at Carnegie Mellon. After an introduction, in Section 2 we ask: who are the climate decision makers? We conclude that they are a diffuse and often divergent group spread all over the world whose decisions are primarily driven by local non-climate considerations. Insights are illustrated with results from the ICAM-2 model. In Section 3 we ask: what is the climate problem? In addition to the conventional answer, we note that in a democracy the problem is whatever voters and their elected representatives think it is. Results from studies of public understanding are reported. Several other specific issues that define the problem, including the treatment of aerosols and alternative indices for comparing greenhouse gases, are discussed. In Section 4 we discuss studies of climate impacts, focusing on coastal zones, the terrestrial biosphere and human health. Particular attention is placed on the roles of adaptation, value change, and technological innovation. In Section 5 selected policy issues are discussed. We conclude by noting that equity has received too little attention in past work. We argue that many conventional tools for policy analysis are not adequate to deal with climate problems.
