# Organise search results into training sets for export


In order to start the team training in a timely manner, I download a sample of the search results from WOS to divide into training sets. To aim to get a distribution of relevant and irrelevant articles, the search string was run in WOS, and then sorted by relevance. The first 3000 and last 3000 records were downloaded. From these 6000 records, I was able to randomly sample the training sets for pilot testing, as well as the sample for training and testing the model (3000 records total). Query link: https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/summary/c04c0155-d6fa-4cf5-9b1d-e00408b0bb81-6b7bdddc/relevance/1


```{r read in sample of search records from WOS and deduplicate}

## read in the sample of the search records downloaded from WOS
recs <- litsearchr::import_results(
  directory = here::here("data","raw-data","sample_WOS_download_2023-01-20")
)



## De-duplicate

# based on doi -- 0 duplicates
unique_id <- revtools::find_duplicates(recs, to_lower = TRUE)
sum(duplicated(unique_id))


# assign the unique ids to the records and filter for only unique entries
recs$unique_id <- unique_id

# based on title
unique_id_title <- revtools::find_duplicates(recs, to_lower = TRUE, match_variable = "title",
                                            match_function = "stringdist", method = "osa",remove_punctuation = TRUE)
recs$unique_id_title <- unique_id_title

# how many duplicates
sum(duplicated(unique_id_title))

# view title duplicates
View(recs[which(unique_id_title %in% unique_id_title[duplicated(unique_id_title)]),c("unique_id","unique_id_title","author","title","year","doi")])

# remove duplicates
ids2remove <- c(105, 762,1113, 1015, 1015, 1392, 2576, 3567)
recs <- subset(recs, !(unique_id %in% ids2remove))

Using this function: https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/irr/html/kappam.fleiss.html

```{r}
require(irr)

# needs a dataframe where each row is an article, and each column is a reviewer. The values represent the decision (can also be multi-categorical)
